      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 60.502
              Standard for Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions from bulk gasoline terminals.
              On and after the date on which § 60.8(a) requires a performance test to be completed, the owner or operator of each bulk gasoline terminal containing an affected facility shall comply with the requirements of this section.
              (a) Each affected facility shall be equipped with a vapor collection system designed to collect the total organic compounds vapors displaced from tank trucks during product loading.
              (b) The emissions to the atmosphere from the vapor collection system due to the loading of liquid product into gasoline tank trucks are not to exceed 35 milligrams of total organic compounds per liter of gasoline loaded, except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) For each affected facility equipped with an existing vapor processing system, the emissions to the atmosphere from the vapor collection system due to the loading of liquid product into gasoline tank trucks are not to exceed 80 milligrams of total organic compounds per liter of gasoline loaded.
              (d) Each vapor collection system shall be designed to prevent any total organic compounds vapors collected at one loading rack from passing to another loading rack.

              (e) Loadings of liquid product into gasoline tank trucks shall be limited to vapor-tight gasoline tank trucks using the following procedures:
              
              (1) The owner or operator shall obtain the vapor tightness documentation described in § 60.505(b) for each gasoline tank truck which is to be loaded at the affected facility.
              (2) The owner or operator shall require the tank identification number to be recorded as each gasoline tank truck is loaded at the affected facility.
              (3)(i) The owner or operator shall cross-check each tank identification number obtained in paragraph (e)(2) of this section with the file of tank vapor tightness documentation within 2 weeks after the corresponding tank is loaded, unless either of the following conditions is maintained:
              (A) If less than an average of one gasoline tank truck per month over the last 26 weeks is loaded without vapor tightness documentation then the documentation cross-check shall be performed each quarter; or
              (B) If less than an average of one gasoline tank truck per month over the last 52 weeks is loaded without vapor tightness documentation then the documentation cross-check shall be performed semiannually.
              (ii) If either the quarterly or semiannual cross-check provided in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) (A) through (B) of this section reveals that these conditions were not maintained, the source must return to biweekly monitoring until such time as these conditions are again met.
              (4) The terminal owner or operator shall notify the owner or operator of each non-vapor-tight gasoline tank truck loaded at the affected facility within 1 week of the documentation cross-check in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
              (5) The terminal owner or operator shall take steps assuring that the nonvapor-tight gasoline tank truck will not be reloaded at the affected facility until vapor tightness documentation for that tank is obtained.
              (6) Alternate procedures to those described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section for limiting gasoline tank truck loadings may be used upon application to, and approval by, the Administrator.
              (f) The owner or operator shall act to assure that loadings of gasoline tank trucks at the affected facility are made only into tanks equipped with vapor collection equipment that is compatible with the terminal's vapor collection system.
              (g) The owner or operator shall act to assure that the terminal's and the tank truck's vapor collection systems are connected during each loading of a gasoline tank truck at the affected facility. Examples of actions to accomplish this include training drivers in the hookup procedures and posting visible reminder signs at the affected loading racks.
              (h) The vapor collection and liquid loading equipment shall be designed and operated to prevent gauge pressure in the delivery tank from exceeding 4,500 pascals (450 mm of water) during product loading. This level is not to be exceeded when measured by the procedures specified in § 60.503(d).

              § 60.503
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b). The three-run requirement of § 60.8(f) does not apply to this subpart.

              (b) Immediately before the performance test required to determine compliance with § 60.502 (b), (c), and (h), the owner or operator shall use Method 21 to monitor for leakage of vapor all potential sources in the terminal's vapor collection system equipment while a gasoline tank truck is being loaded. The owner or operator shall repair all leaks with readings of 10,000 ppm (as methane) or greater before conducting the performance test.
              (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standards in § 60.502 (b) and (c) as follows:
              (1) The performance test shall be 6 hours long during which at least 300,000 liters of gasoline is loaded. If this is not possible, the test may be continued the same day until 300,000 liters of gasoline is loaded or the test may be resumed the next day with another complete 6-hour period. In the latter case, the 300,000-liter criterion need not be met. However, as much as possible, testing should be conducted during the 6-hour period in which the highest throughput normally occurs.
              (2) If the vapor processing system is intermittent in operation, the performance test shall begin at a reference vapor holder level and shall end at the same reference point. The test shall include at least two startups and shutdowns of the vapor processor. If this does not occur under automatically controlled operations, the system shall be manually controlled.
              (3) The emission rate (E) of total organic compounds shall be computed using the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.063
              
              
                where:
                
                E = emission rate of total organic compounds, mg/liter of gasoline loaded.
                Vesi = volume of air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval “i”, scm.
                Cei = concentration of total organic compounds at each interval “i”, ppm.
                L = total volume of gasoline loaded, liters.
                n = number of testing intervals.
                i = emission testing interval of 5 minutes.
                K = density of calibration gas, 1.83 × 106 for propane and 2.41 × 106 for butane, mg/scm.
              
              

              (4) The performance test shall be conducted in intervals of 5 minutes. For each interval “i”, readings from each measurement shall be recorded, and the volume exhausted (Vesi) and the corresponding average total organic compounds concentration (Cei) shall be determined. The sampling system response time shall be considered in determining the average total organic compounds concentration corresponding to the volume exhausted.

              (5) The following methods shall be used to determine the volume (Vesi) air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval:
              (i) Method 2B shall be used for combustion vapor processing systems.
              (ii) Method 2A shall be used for all other vapor processing systems.

              (6) Method 25A or 25B shall be used for determining the total organic compounds concentration (Cei) at each interval. The calibration gas shall be either propane or butane. The owner or operator may exclude the methane and ethane content in the exhaust vent by any method (e.g., Method 18) approved by the Administrator.
              (7) To determine the volume (L) of gasoline dispensed during the performance test period at all loading racks whose vapor emissions are controlled by the processing system being tested, terminal records or readings from gasoline dispensing meters at each loading rack shall be used.
              (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standard in § 60.502(h) as follows:
              (1) A pressure measurement device (liquid manometer, magnehelic gauge, or equivalent instrument), capable of measuring up to 500 mm of water gauge pressure with ±2.5 mm of water precision, shall be calibrated and installed on the terminal's vapor collection system at a pressure tap located as close as possible to the connection with the gasoline tank truck.
              (2) During the performance test, the pressure shall be recorded every 5 minutes while a gasoline truck is being loaded; the highest instantaneous pressure that occurs during each loading shall also be recorded. Every loading position must be tested at least once during the performance test.

              (e) The performance test requirements of paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to flares defined in § 60.501 and meeting the requirements in § 60.18(b) through (f). The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the flare and associated vapor collection system is in compliance with the requirements in §§ 60.18(b) through (f) and 60.503(a), (b), and (d).
              (f) The owner or operator shall use alternative test methods and procedures in accordance with the alternative test method provisions in § 60.8(b) for flares that do not meet the requirements in § 60.18(b).

              (i) A valid certification test demonstrates that the representative affected wood heater complies with the applicable emission standards in § 60.532;
              (ii) Any tolerances or materials for components listed in paragraph (k)(2) or (3) of this section that are different from those specified in those paragraphs may not reasonably be anticipated to cause wood heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits; and
              (iii) The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section have been met.
              (2) The Administrator will deny certification if the Administrator determines that the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section have not been satisfied. Upon denying certification under this paragraph, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for this determination.
              (d) Level of compliance certification. The Administrator will issue the certificate of compliance for the most stringent particulate matter emission standard that the tested representative wood heater meets under § 60.532.
              (e) Conditional, temporary certificate of compliance. A conditional, temporary certificate of compliance may be granted by the Administrator until May 16, 2016 based on the manufacturer's submittal of a complete certification application meeting all the requirements in § 60.533(b). The application must include the full test report by an EPA-approved laboratory and all required compliance statements by the manufacturer with the exception of a certificate of conformity by an EPA-approved third-party certifier. The conditional, temporary certificate of compliance would allow manufacture and sales of the affected wood heater model line until May 16, 2016 or until the Administrator completes the review of the application, whichever is earlier. By May 16, 2016, the manufacturer must submit a certificate of conformity by an EPA-approved third-party certifier.
              (f) Third-party certifier-based application process. (1) Any manufacturer of an affected wood heater must apply to the Administrator for a certificate of compliance for each model line. The manufacturer must meet the following requirements:
              (i) The manufacturer must contract with a third-party certifier for certification services. The contract must include regular (at least annual) unannounced audits under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 to ensure that the manufacturer's quality assurance plan is being implemented. The contract must also include a report for each audit under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 that fully documents the results of the audit. The contract must include authorization and requirement for the third-party certifier to submit all such reports to the Administrator and the manufacturer within 30 days of the audit. The audit report must identify deviations from the manufacturer's quality assurance plan and specify the corrective actions that need to be taken to address each identified deficiency.
              (ii) The manufacturer must submit the materials specified in paragraph (b) of this section and a quality assurance plan that meets the requirements of paragraph (m) of this section to the third-party certifier. The quality assurance plan must ensure that units within a model line will be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the wood heater submitted for certification testing, and it must include design drawings for the model line.
              (iii) The manufacturer must apply to the third-party certifier for a certification of conformity with the applicable requirements of this subpart for the model line.

              (A) After testing by an approved test laboratory is complete, certification of conformity with the emission standards in § 60.532 must be performed by the manufacturer's contracted third-party certifier.
              
              (B) The third-party certifier may certify conformity if the emission tests have been conducted per the appropriate guidelines; the test report is complete and accurate; the instrumentation used for the test was properly calibrated; the test report shows that the representative affected wood heater meets the applicable emission limits specified in § 60.532; the quality assurance plan is adequate to ensure that units within the model line will be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the wood heater submitted for certification testing; and that the affected heaters would meet all applicable requirements of this subpart.
              (iv) The manufacturer must then submit to the Administrator an application for a certificate of compliance that includes the certification of conformity, quality assurance plan, test report and all supporting documentation specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (v) The submission also must include a statement signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer or authorized representative that the manufacturer has complied with and will continue to comply with all requirements of this subpart for certificate of compliance and that the manufacturer remains responsible for compliance regardless of any error by the test laboratory or third-party certifier.
              (2) The Administrator will issue to the manufacturer a certificate of compliance for a model line if it is determined, based on all of the information submitted in the application for certification and any other relevant information, that:
              (i) A valid certification of conformity has demonstrated that the representative affected wood heater complies with the applicable emission standards in § 60.532;
              (ii) Any tolerances or materials for components listed in paragraph (k)(2) or (3) of this section that are different from those specified in those paragraphs may not be reasonably anticipated to cause wood heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits;
              (iii) The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section have been met; and
              (iv) A valid certificate of conformity for the model line has been prepared and submitted.
              (3) The Administrator will deny certification if the Administrator determines that the criteria in paragraph (f)(2) of this section have not been satisfied. Upon denying certification under this paragraph, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination.
              (g) Waiver from submitting test results. An applicant for certification may apply for a potential waiver of the requirement to submit the results of a certification test pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, if the wood heater meets either of the following conditions:
              (1) The wood heaters of the model line are similar in all material respects that would affect emissions, as defined in § 60.531, to another model line that has already been issued a certificate of compliance. A manufacturer that seeks a waiver of certification testing must identify the model line that has been certified, and must submit a copy of an agreement with the owner of the design permitting the applicant to produce wood heaters of that design.
              (2) The manufacturer has previously conducted a valid certification test to demonstrate that the wood heaters of the model line meet the applicable standard specified in § 60.532.
              (h) Certification period. Unless revoked sooner by the Administrator, a certificate of compliance will be valid for the following periods as applicable:

              (1) For a model line that was previously certified as meeting the 1990 Phase II emission standards under the 1988 NSPS, in effect prior to May 15, 2015, at an emission level equal to or less than the 2015 emission standards in § 60.532(a), the model line is deemed to have a certificate of compliance for the 2015 emission standards in § 60.532(a), which is valid until the effective date for the 2020 standards in § 60.532(b) (i.e., until May 15, 2020).

              (2) For a model line certified as meeting emission standards in § 60.532, a certificate of compliance will be valid for 5 years from the date of issuance or until a more stringent standard comes into effect, whichever is sooner.
              
              (i) Renewal of certification. (1) The manufacturer must request renewal of a model line's certificate of compliance or recertify the model line every 5 years, or the manufacturer may choose to no longer manufacture or sell that model line after the expiration date. If the manufacturer chooses to no longer manufacture that model line, then the manufacturer must submit a statement to the Administrator to that effect.
              (2) A manufacturer of an affected wood heater model line may apply to the Administrator for potential renewal of its certificate of compliance by submitting the material specified in paragraph (b) and following the procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section, or by affirming in writing that the wood heaters in the model line continue to be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the representative wood heater submitted for testing on which the original certificate of compliance was based and requesting a potential waiver from certification testing. The application must include a copy of the review of the draft application and approval by the third-party certifier.
              (3) If the Administrator grants a renewal of certification, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination and issue a certification renewal.
              (4) If the Administrator denies the request for a renewal of certification, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination.
              (5) If the Administrator denies the request for a renewal of certification, the manufacturer and retailer must not manufacture or sell the previously-certified wood heaters after the expiration date of the certificate of compliance.
              (j) [Reserved]
              (k) Recertification. (1) The manufacturer must recertify a model line whenever any change is made in the design submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section that affects or is presumed to affect the particulate matter emission rate for that model line. The manufacturer of an affected wood heater must apply to the Administrator for potential recertification by submitting the material specified in paragraph (b) and following the procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section, or by affirming in writing that the change will not cause wood heaters in the model line to exceed applicable emission limits and requesting a potential waiver from certification testing. The application for recertification must be reviewed and approved by the contracted third-party certifier and a copy of the review and approval must be included. The Administrator may waive this requirement upon written request by the manufacturer, if the manufacturer presents adequate rationale and the Administrator determines that the change may not reasonably be anticipated to cause wood heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits. The granting of such a waiver does not relieve the manufacturer of any compliance obligations under this subpart.
              (2) Any change in the design tolerances or actual dimensions of any of the following components (where such components are applicable) is presumed to affect particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency if that change exceeds ±0.64 cm (±1/4 inch) for any linear dimension and ±5 percent for any cross-sectional area relating to air introduction systems and catalyst bypass gaps unless other dimensions and cross-sectional areas are previously approved by the Administrator under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section:
              (i) Firebox: Dimensions;
              (ii) Air introduction systems: Cross-sectional area of restrictive air inlets and outlets, location and method of control;
              (iii) Baffles: Dimensions and locations;
              (iv) Refractory/insulation: Dimensions and location;
              (v) Catalyst: Dimensions and location;
              (vi) Catalyst bypass mechanism and catalyst bypass gap tolerances (when bypass mechanism is in closed position): Dimensions, cross-sectional area, and location;
              (vii) Flue gas exit: Dimensions and location;

              (viii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets: Dimensions and fit;
              
              (ix) Outer thermal shielding and thermal coverings: Dimensions and location;
              (x) Fuel feed system: For wood heaters that are designed primarily to burn pellet fuel or wood chips and other wood heaters equipped with a fuel feed system, the fuel feed rate, auger motor design and power rating, and the angle of the auger to the firebox; and
              (xi) Forced-air combustion system: For wood heaters so equipped, the location and horsepower of blower motors and the fan blade size.
              (3) Any change in the materials used for the following components is presumed to affect particulate matter emissions and efficiency:
              (i) Refractory/insulation; or
              (ii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets.
              (4) A change in the make, model or composition of a catalyst is presumed to affect particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency, unless the change has been requested by the heater manufacturer and has been approved in advance by the Administrator, based on test data that demonstrate that the replacement catalyst is equivalent to or better than the original catalyst in terms of particulate matter emission reduction.
              (l) Criteria for revocation of certification. (1) The Administrator may revoke certification if it is determined that the wood heaters being manufactured or sold in that model line do not comply with the requirements of this subpart. Such a determination will be based on all available evidence, including but not limited to:
              (i) Test data from a retesting of the original unit on which the certification test was conducted or a unit that is similar in all material respects that would affect emissions;
              (ii) A finding that the certification test was not valid. The finding will be based on problems or irregularities with the certification test or its documentation, but may be supplemented by other information;
              (iii) A finding that the labeling of the wood heater model line, the owner's manual or the associated marketing information does not comply with the requirements of § 60.536;
              (iv) Failure by the manufacturer to comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements under § 60.537;
              (v) Physical examination showing that a significant percentage (as defined in the quality assurance plan approved pursuant to paragraph (m) of this section, but no larger than 1 percent) of production units inspected is not similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the representative affected wood heater submitted for certification testing;
              (vi) Failure of the manufacturer to conduct a quality assurance program in conformity with paragraph (m) of this section; or
              (vii) Failure of the approved laboratory to test the wood heater using the methods specified in § 60.534.
              (2) Revocation of certification under this paragraph (l) will not take effect until the manufacturer concerned has been given written notice by the Administrator setting forth the basis for the proposed determination and an opportunity to request a hearing under § 60.539.
              (m) Quality assurance program. On or after May 16, 2016, for each certified model line, the manufacturer must conduct a quality assurance program that satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (m)(1) through (5) of this section. The quality assurance program requirements of this paragraph (m) supersede the quality assurance plan requirements previously specified in § 60.533(o) that was in effect prior to May 15, 2015. The manufacturer of a model line with a compliance certification under paragraph (h)(1) of this section must conduct a quality assurance program that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (m) by May 16, 2016.
              (1) The manufacturer must prepare and operate according to a quality assurance plan for each certified model line that includes specific inspection and testing requirements for ensuring that all units within a model line are similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the wood heater submitted for certification testing and meet the emissions standards in § 60.532.

              (2) The quality assurance plan must be approved by the third-party certifier as part of the certification of conformity process specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (3) The quality assurance plan must include regular (at least annual) unannounced audits by the third-party certifier under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 to ensure that the manufacturer's quality assurance plan is being implemented.
              (4) The quality assurance plan must include a report for each audit under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 that fully documents the results of the audit. The third-party certifier must be authorized and required to submit all such reports to the Administrator and the manufacturer within 30 days of the audit. The audit report must identify deviations from the manufacturer's quality assurance plan and specify the corrective actions that need to be taken to address each identified deficiency.
              (5) Within 30 days after receiving each audit report, the manufacturer must report to the third-party certifier and to the Administrator its corrective actions and responses to any deficiencies identified in the audit report. No such report is required if an audit report did not identify any deficiencies.
              (n) EPA compliance audit testing. (1)(i) The Administrator may select by written notice wood heaters or model lines for compliance audit testing to determine compliance with the emission standards in § 60.532.
              (ii) The Administrator will transmit a written notification of the selected wood heaters or model line(s) to the manufacturer, which will include the name and address of the laboratory selected to perform the audit test and the model name and serial number of the wood heater(s) or model line(s) selected to undergo audit testing.
              (2)(i) The Administrator may test, or direct the manufacturer to have tested, a wood heater or a wood heater from the model line(s) selected under paragraph (n)(1)(i) of this section in a laboratory approved under § 60.535. The Administrator may select any approved test laboratory or federal laboratory for this audit testing.
              (ii) The expense of the compliance audit test is the responsibility of the wood heater manufacturer.
              (iii) The test must be conducted using the same test method used to obtain certification. If the certification test consisted of more than one particulate matter sampling test method, the Administrator may direct the manufacturer and test laboratory as to which of these methods to use for the purpose of audit testing. The Administrator will notify the manufacturer at least 30 days prior to any test under this paragraph, and allow the manufacturer and/or his authorized representatives to observe the test.
              (3) Revocation of certification. (i) If emissions from a wood heater tested under paragraph (n)(2) of this section exceed the applicable emission standard by more than 50 percent using the same test method used to obtain certification, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer that certification for that model line is suspended effective 72 hours from the receipt of the notice, unless the suspension notice is withdrawn by the Administrator. The suspension will remain in effect until withdrawn by the Administrator, or the date 30 days from its effective date if a revocation notice under paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section is not issued within that period, or the date of final agency action on revocation, whichever occurs earliest.
              (ii)(A) If emissions from a wood heater tested under paragraph (n)(2) of this section exceed the applicable emission limit, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer that certification is revoked for that model line.
              (B) A revocation notice under paragraph (n)(3)(ii)(A) of this section will become final and effective 60 days after the date of written notification to the manufacturer, unless it is withdrawn, a hearing is requested under § 60.539(a)(2), or the deadline for requesting a hearing is extended.
              (C) The Administrator may extend the deadline for requesting a hearing for up to 60 days for good cause.
              (D) A manufacturer may extend the deadline for requesting a hearing for up to 6 months, by agreeing to a voluntary suspension of certification.

              (iii) Any notification under paragraph (n)(3)(i) or (n)(3)(ii) of this section will include a copy of a preliminary test report from the approved test laboratory or federal test laboratory. The test laboratory must provide a preliminary test report to the Administrator within 14 days of the completion of testing, if a wood heater exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 60.532. The test laboratory must provide the Administrator and the manufacturer, within 30 days of the completion of testing, all documentation pertaining to the test, including the complete test report and raw data sheets, laboratory technician notes, and test results for all test runs.
              (iv) Upon receiving notification of a test failure under paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer may request that up to four additional wood heaters from the same model line be tested at the manufacturer's expense, at the test laboratory that performed the emissions test for the Administrator.
              (v) Whether or not the manufacturer proceeds under paragraph (n)(3)(iv) of this section, the manufacturer may submit any relevant information to the Administrator, including any other test data generated pursuant to this subpart. The manufacturer must bear the expense of any additional testing.
              (vi) The Administrator will withdraw any notice issued under paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section if tests under paragraph (n)(3)(iv) of this section show either—
              (A) That exactly four additional wood heaters were tested for the manufacturer and all four met the applicable emission limits; or
              (B) That exactly two additional wood heaters were tested for the manufacturer and each of them met the applicable emission limits and the average emissions of all three tested heaters (the original audit heater and the two additional heaters) met the applicable emission limits.
              (vii) If the Administrator withdraws a notice pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(vi) of this section, the Administrator will revise the certification values for the model line based on the test data and other relevant information. The manufacturer must then revise the model line's labels and marketing information accordingly.
              (viii) The Administrator may withdraw any proposed revocation, if the Administrator finds that an audit test failure has been rebutted by information submitted by the manufacturer under paragraph (n)(3)(iv) of this section and/or (n)(3)(v) of this section or by any other relevant information available to the Administrator.
            
            
              § 60.534
              What test methods and procedures must I use to determine compliance with the standards and requirements for certification?
              Test methods and procedures specified in this section or in appendices of this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), must be used to determine compliance with the standards and requirements for certification under §§ 60.532 and 60.533 and for reporting carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency as follows:
              (a)(1) For affected wood heaters subject to the 2015 and 2020 particulate matter emission standards of §§ 60.532(a) and (b), the manufacturer must have an EPA-approved test laboratory conduct testing according to paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. The manufacturer or manufacturer's authorized representative must submit a summary and the full test reports with all supporting information, including detailed discussion of all anomalies, whether all burn rate categories were properly achieved, any data not used in the calculations and, for any test runs not completed, the data that were collected and the reason that the test run was not completed. The burn rate for the low burn rate category must be no greater than the rate that an operator can achieve in home use and no greater than is advertised by the manufacturer or retailer. The manufacturer has the option of submitting test results obtained pursuant to either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section to the Administrator as specified under § 60.537 as part of a request for a certification of compliance.

              (i) Conduct testing with crib wood using EPA Method 28R of appendix A-8 of this part or an alternative crib wood test method approved by the Administrator or the ASTM E2779-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) pellet heater test method to establish the certification test conditions and the particulate matter emission values.
              
              (ii) Conduct testing with cord wood using an alternative cord wood test method approved by the Administrator to establish the certification test conditions and the particulate matter emission values.
              (2) For the 2020 cord wood alternative means of compliance option specified in § 60.532(c), the manufacturer must have an EPA-approved test laboratory conduct testing with cord wood using an alternative cord wood test method approved by the Administrator to establish the certification test conditions and the particulate matter emission values.
              (b) [Reserved]
              (c) For affected wood heaters subject to the 2015 and 2020 particulate matter emission standards specified in § 60.532(a), (b) and (c), particulate matter emission concentrations must be measured with ASTM E2515-11 (IBR, see § 60.17). Four-inch filters and Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used in ASTM E2515-11.
              (d) For all tests conducted using ASTM E2515-11 (IBR, see § 60.17) pursuant to this section, the manufacturer and approved test laboratory must also measure the first hour of particulate matter emissions for each test run using a separate filter in one of the two parallel trains. The manufacturer and approved test laboratory must report the test results for the first hour separately and also include them in the total particulate matter emissions per run.
              (e) The manufacturer must have the approved test laboratory measure the efficiency, heat output and carbon monoxide emissions of the tested wood heater using Canadian Standards Administration (CSA) Method B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), section 13.7.
              (f) Douglas fir may be used in ASTM E2779-10, ASTM E2780-10 and CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17).

              (g) The manufacturer of an affected wood heater model line must notify the Administrator of the date that certification testing is scheduled to begin by email to WoodHeaterReports@epa.gov. This notice must be received by the EPA at least 30 days before the start of testing. The notification of testing must include the manufacturer's name and physical and email addresses, the approved test laboratory's name and physical and email addresses, the third-party certifier name, the model name and number (or, if unavailable, some other way to distinguish between models), and the dates of testing. The laboratory may substitute certification testing of another affected wood heater on the original date in order to ensure regular laboratory testing operations.
              (h) The approved test laboratory must allow the manufacturer, the manufacturer's approved third-party certifier, the EPA and delegated state regulatory agencies to observe certification testing. However, manufacturers must not involve themselves in the conduct of the test after the pretest burn has begun. Communications between the manufacturer and laboratory or third-party certifier personnel regarding operation of the wood heater must be limited to written communications transmitted prior to the first pretest burn of the certification test series. During certification tests, the manufacturer may communicate with laboratory personnel only in writing and only to notify them that the manufacturer has observed a deviation from proper test procedures. All communications must be included in the test documentation required to be submitted pursuant to § 60.533(b)(5) and must be consistent with instructions provided in the owner's manual required under § 60.536(g), except to the extent that they address details of the certification tests that would not be relevant to owners or regulators.

              N = G (1-R)
              Nb = Gb (1-R)
              
              For the initial performance test, the overall reduction efficiency (R) shall be determined as prescribed under paragraphs (f)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section. After the initial performance test, the owner or operator may use the most recently determined overall reduction efficiency (R) for the performance test. No monthly performance tests are required. The performance test shall be repeated during conditions described under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

              (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall construct a temporary enclosure around the application and drying areas during the performance test for the purpose of capturing fugitive VOC emissions. The enclosure must be maintained at a negative pressure to ensure that all evaporated VOC are measurable. Determine the fraction (Fc) of total VOC used at the affected facility that enters the control device:
              
                EC01JN92.040
              
              
                Where:
                
                “m” is the number of vents from the affected facility to the control device, and “n” is the number of vents from the affected facility to the atmosphere and from the temporary enclosure.

                Where:
                
                “m” is the number of vents from the affected facility to the control device, and “p” is the number of vents after the control device.
              
              
              (iii) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R):
              
              R = EFc
              
              
              (iv) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall have the option of substituting the following procedure as an acceptable alternative to the requirements prescribed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. This alternative procedure is acceptable only in cases where a single VOC is used and is present in the capture system. The average capture efficiency value derived from a minimum of three runs shall constitute a test.

              (A) For each run, “i,” measure the mass of the material containing a single VOC used. This measurement shall be made using a scale that has both a calibration and a readability to within 1 percent of the mass used during the run. This measurement may be made by filling the direct supply reservoir (e.g., trough, tray, or drum that is integral to the operation) and related application equipment (e.g., rollers, pumps, hoses) to a marked level at the start of the run and then refilling to the same mark from a more easily weighed container (e.g., separate supply drum) at the end of the run. The change in mass of the supply drum would equal the mass of material used from the direct supply reservoir. Alternatively, this measurement may be made by weighing the direct supply reservoir at the start and end of the run or by weighing the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start and end of the run. The change in mass would equal the mass of the material used in the run. If only the direct supply reservoir is weighed, the amount of material in or on the related application equipment must be the same at the start and end of the run. All additions of VOC containing material made to the direct supply reservoir during a run must be properly accounted for in determining the mass of material used during that run.
              (B) For each run, “i,” measure the mass of the material containing a single VOC which is present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run, unless the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, in which case, this measurement is not required. This measurement may be made directly by emptying the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment and then filling them to a marked level from an easily weighed container (e.g. separate supply drum). The change in mass of the supply drum would equal the mass of material in the filled direct supply reservoir and related application equipment. Alternatively, this measurement may be made by weighing the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run and subtracting the mass of the empty direct supply reservoir and related application equipment (tare weight).
              (C) For each run, “i,” the starting weight fraction VOC in the material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken from the direct supply reservoir at the beginning of the run.
              (D) For each run, “i,” the ending weight fraction VOC in the material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken from the direct supply reservoir at the end of the run.
              (E) For each run, “i,” in which the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single VOC used (Mi) by multiplying the mass of the material used in the run by the starting weight fraction VOC of the material used in the run.

              (F) For each run, “i,” in which the ending weight fraction VOC in the material is less than 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single VOC used (Mi) as follows:
              (1) Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run by multiplying the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run by the starting weight fraction VOC in the material for that run.
              (2) Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run by multiplying the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run by the ending weight fraction VOC in the material for that run. The mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run shall be calculated by subtracting the mass of material used in the run from the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run.
              (3) The mass of the single VOC used (Mi) equals the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the start of the run minus the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of the run.

              (G) If Method 25A is used to determine the concentration of the single VOC in the capture system, then calculate the capture efficiency (FCi) for each run, “i,” as follows:
              
                EC01JN92.042
              
              
                Where:
                
                Ci = Average concentration of the single VOC in the capture system during run “i” (parts per million by volume) corrected for background VOC (see § 60.547(a)(5)).

                W = Molecular weight of the single VOC, mg/mg-mole (lb/lb-mole).
                

                V = The volume occupied by one mole of ideal gas at standard conditions [20 °C, 760 mm Hg] on a wet basis, 2.405 × 10−5 m3/mg-mole (385.3 ft3/lb-mole).
                Qi = Volumetric flow in the capture system during run i, on a wet basis, adjusted to standard conditions, m3 (ft3) (see § 60.547(a)(5)).
                106 = ppm per unity.
                Mi = Mass of the single VOC used during run i, mg (lb).
              
              

              (H) If Method 25 is used to determine the concentration of the single VOC in the capture system, then calculate the capture efficiency (FCi) for each run, “i,” as follows:
              
                EC01JN92.043
              
              
                Where: Ci = Average concentration of the single VOC in the capture system during run “i” (parts per million, as carbon, by volume) corrected for background VOC (see § 60.547(a)(5)).
                W = Molecular weight of the single VOC, mg/mg-mole (lb/lb-mole).

                V = The volume occupied by one mole of ideal gas at standard conditions [20 °C, 760 mm Hg] on a wet basis, 2.405 × 10−5 m3/mg-mole (385.3 ft3/lb-mole).
                Qi = Volumetric flow in the capture system during run i, on a wet basis, adjusted to standard conditions, m3 (ft3) (see § 60.547(a)(5)).
                106 = ppm per unity.
                Mi = Mass of the single VOC used during run i, mg (lb).
                NC = Number of carbon atoms in one molecule of the single VOC.
              
              
              (I) Calculate the average capture efficiency value, Fc as follows:
              
                EC01JN92.044
              
              
                Where:
                
                “n” equals the number of runs made in the test (n ≥ 3). In cases where an alternative procedure in this paragraph is used, the requirements in paragraphs (f)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section remain unchanged.
              
              
              (g) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing operation, each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays are used, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation that uses a VOC emission reduction system with a control device that destroys VOC (e.g., incinerator), the owner or operator shall use the following procedure to determine compliance with the percent emission reduction requirement specified under § 60.542 (a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), (8)(i), (9)(i), and (10)(i).

              Mr = Lr Dr
              
              
              (3) Calculate the overall reduction efficiency for the VOC emission reduction system (R) for the month:
              
                EC16NO91.066
              

              (4) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per tire cemented at the affected facility for the month (N) or mass of VOC emitted per bead cemeted at the affected facility for the month (Nb):

              Nb = Gb (1-R)
              
              (i) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cemeting operation, each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays are used, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation that uses a VOC emission reduction system with a control device that recovers (VOC) (e.g., carbon adsorber), the owner or operator shall use the following procedure to determine compliance with the percent reduction requirement specified under § 60.542(a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), (8)(i), (9)(i), and (10)(i).

              (j) Rather than seeking to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of § 60.542(a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), or (9)(i) using the performance test procedures described under paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section, an owner or operator of an undertread cementing operation, sidewall cementing operation, green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays are used, or Michelin-B operation that use a VOC emission reduction system may seek to demonstrate compliance by meeting the equipment design and performance specifications listed under paragraphs (j)(1), (2), and (4) through (6) or under paragraphs (j)(1) and (3) through (6) of this section, and by conducting a control device efficiency performance test to determine compliance as described under paragraph (j)(7) of this section. The owner or operator shall conduct this performance test of the control device efficiency no later than 180 days after initial startup of the affected facility, as specified under § 60.8(a). Meeting the capture system design and performance specifications, in conjunction with operating a 95 percent efficient control device, is an acceptable means of demonstrating compliance with the standard. Therefore, the requirement for the initial performance test on the enclosure, as specified under § 60.8(a), is waived. No monthly performance tests are required.
              (1) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing operation, and each Michelin-B operation, the cement application and drying area shall be contained in an enclosure that meets the criteria specified under paragraphs (j) (2), (4), and (5) of this section; for each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays are used, the spray application and drying area shall be contained in an enclosure that meets the criteria specified under paragraphs (j) (3), (4), and (5) of this section.
              (2) The drying area shall be enclosed between the application area and the water bath or to the extent necessary to contain all tire components for at least 30 seconds after cement application, whichever distance is less.
              (3) Sprayed green tires shall remain in the enclosure for a minimum of 30 seconds after spray application.

              (4) A minimum face velocity of 30.5 meters (100 feet) per minute shall be maintained continuously through each permanent opening into the enclosure when all temporary enclosure openings are closed. The cross-sectional area of each permanent opening shall be divided into at least 12 equal areas, and a velocity measurement shall be performed at the centroid of each equal area with an anemometer or similar velocity monitoring device; the face velocity of each permanent opening is the average value of the velocity measurements taken. The monitoring device shall be calibrated and operated according to the manufacturer's instructions.
              Temporary enclosure openings shall remain closed at all times except when worker access is necessary.
              (5) The total area of all permanent openings into the enclosure shall not exceed the area that would be necessary to maintain the VOC concentration of the exhaust gas stream at 25 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) under the following conditions:
              (i) The facility is operating at the maximum solvent use rate;
              (ii) The face velocity through each permanent opening is 30.5 meters (100 feet) per minute; and
              (iii) All temporary openings are closed.
              (6) All captured VOC are ducted to a VOC emission control device that is operated on a continuous basis and that achieves at least a 95 percent destruction or recovery efficiency.
              (7) The efficiency of the control device (E) for the initial performance test is determined by using values of the volumetric flow rate of each of the gas streams and the VOC content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of the control device as described under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. The control device efficiency shall be redetermined during conditions specified under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (k) Each owner or operator of an affected facility who initially elected to be subject to the applicable percent emission reduction requirement specified under § 60.542(a)(1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), (8)(i), (9)(i), or (10)(i) and who later seeks to comply with the applicable total (uncontrolled) monthly VOC use limit specified under § 60.542(a)(1)(ii), (2)(ii), (6)(ii), (7)(iv), (8)(ii), (9)(ii), or (10)(ii) shall demonstrate, using the procedures described under paragraph (c) of this section, that the total VOC use at the affected facility has not exceeded the applicable total (uncontrolled) monthly VOC use limit during each of the last 6 months of operation. The owner or operator shall be subject to the applicable percent emission reduction requirement until the conditions of this paragraph and § 60.546(h) are satisfied.
              (l) In determining compliance for each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing operation, each green tire spraying operation, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation, the owner or operator shall include all the VOC used, recovered, or destroyed from cements and organic solvent-based green tire sprays including those cements or sprays used for tires other than those defined under § 60.541(a).

              (m) In determining compliance for each tread end cementing operation, each bead cementing operation, and each green tire spraying operation, the owner or operator shall include only those tires defined under § 60.541(a) when determining To and Bo.
              (n) For each undertread cementing operation and each sidewall cementing operation that does not use a VOC emission reduction system, the owner or operator shall use the following procedure to determine compliance with the VOC emission per tire limit specified in § 60.542a:
              (1) Calculate the total mass of VOC (Mo) used at the affected facility for the month by the following procedure.

                EC01JN92.046
              
              
                Where: “n” equals the number of different cements or sprays used during the month.
              
              
              (B) Determine the fraction (Fo) of “M” used by the affected facility by comparing the production records and process specifications for the material cemented at the affected facility for the month to the production records and process specifications for the material cemented at all other facilities served by the common distribution system for the month or by another procedure acceptable to the Administrator.

                EC16NO91.067
              
              (2) Determine the total number of tires (To) processed at the affected facility for the month by the following procedure.
              (i) For undertread cementing, To equals the number of tread or combined tread/sidewall components which receive an application of undertread cement.
              (ii) For sidewall cementing, To equals the number of sidewall components which receive an application of sidewall cement, divided by 2.

              (4) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per tire processed (N) for the affected facility for the month:
              
                EC16NO91.069
              
              (5) Where the value of the mass of VOC emitted per tire processed (N) is less than or equal to the VOC emission per tire limit specified under § 60.542a, the affected facility is in compliance.

              § 60.547
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) The test methods in appendix A to this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with § 60.542(a) as follows:
              (1) Method 24 or formulation data for the determination of the VOC content of cements or green tire spray materials. In the event of dispute, Method 24 shall be the reference method. For Method 24, the cement or green tire spray sample shall be a 1-liter sample collected in a 1-liter container at a point where the sample will be representative of the material as applied in the affected facility.
              (2) Method 25 as the reference method for the determination of the VOC concentrations in each stack, both entering and leaving an emission control device. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days in advance of any test by Method 25. For Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs shall be at least 1 hour. Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site, and the sampling point shall be the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.0 meter (3.3 feet). The minimum sample volume shall be 0.003 dry standard cubic meter (dscm) (0.11 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) except that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variables or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator.
              (3) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, as the reference method for determination of the flow rate of the stack gas. The measurement site shall be the same as for the Method 25 sampling. A velocity traverse shall be made once per run within the hour that the Method 25 sample is taken.
              (4) Method 4 for determination of stack gas moisture.
              (5) Method 25 or Method 25A for determination of the VOC concentration in a capture system prior to a control device when only a single VOC is present (see § 60.543 (f)(2)(iv)(G) and (f)(2)(iv)(H)). The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days in advance of any test by either Method 25 or Method 25A. Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site and the sampling point shall be the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.0 meter (3.3 feet). Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, shall be used as the test method for the concurrent determination of gas flow rate in the capture system.

              (i) For Method 25, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 1 hour. For each run, a concurrent sample shall be taken immediately upwind of the application area to determine the background VOC concentration of air drawn into the capture system. Subtract this reading from the reading obtained in the capture system for that run. The minimum sample volume shall be 0.003 dry standard cubic meter (dscm) (0.11 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) except that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variable or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator. Use Method 3 to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.
              (ii) For Method 25A, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 1 hour. Instrument calibration shall be performed by the procedure given in Method 25A using the single VOC present in the capture system. A different calibration gas may be used if the results are corrected using an experimentally determined response factor comparing the alternative calibration gas to the single VOC used in the process. After the instrument has been calibrated, determine the background VOC concentration of the air drawn into the capture system immediately upwind of the application area for each run. The instrument does not need to be recalibrated for the background measurement. Subtract this reading from the reading obtained in the capture system for that run. The Method 25A results shall only be used in the alternative procedure for determination of capture efficiency described under § 60.543(f)(2)(iv)(G).

              55 FR 51035, Dec. 11, 1990, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 60.560
              Applicability and designation of affected facilities.
              (a) Affected facilities. The provisions of this subpart apply to affected facilities involved in the manufacture of polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, or poly (ethylene terephthalate) as defined in § 60.561 of this subpart. The affected facilities designated below for polypropylene and polyethylene are inclusive of all equipment used in the manufacture of these polymers, beginning with raw materials preparation and ending with product storage, and cover all emissions emanating from such equipment.
              (1) For process emissions from any polypropylene and polyethylene manufacturing process that uses a continuous process, the affected facilities are each of the following process sections: each raw materials preparation section, each polymerization reaction section, each material recovery section, each product finishing section, and each product storage section. These process sections are affected facilities for process emissions that are emitted continuously and for process emissions that are emitted intermittently.
              (2) For process emissions from polystyrene manufacturing processes that use a continuous process, the affected facilities are each material recovery section. These process sections are affected facilities for only those process emissions that are emitted continuously.

              (3) For process emissions from poly(ethylene terephthalate) manufacturing processes that use a continuous process, the affected facilities are each polymerization reaction section. If the process uses dimethyl terephthalate, then each material recovery section is also an affected facility. If the process uses terephthalic acid, then each raw materials preparation section is also an affected facility. These process sections are affected facilities for only those process emissions that are emitted continuously.
              (4) For VOC emissions from equipment leaks from polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene (including expandable polystyrene) manufacturing processes, the affected facilities are each group of fugitive emissions equipment (as defined in § 60.561) within any process unit (as defined in § 60.561). This subpart does not apply to VOC emissions from equipment leaks from poly(ethylene terephthalate) manufacturing processes.
              (i) Affected facilities with a design capacity to produce less than 1,000 Mg/yr (1,102 ton/yr) shall be exempt from § 60.562-2.
              (ii) Addition or replacement of equipment for the purposes of improvement which is accomplished without a capital expenditure shall not by itself be considered a modification under § 60.562-2.
              (b) Applicability dates. The applicability date identifies when an affected facility becomes subject to a standard. Usually, a standard has a single applicability date. However, some polypropylene and polyethylene affected facilities have a September 30, 1987, applicability date and others have a January 10, 1989, applicability date. The following paragraphs identify the applicability dates for all affected facilities subject to this subpart.
              (1) Polypropylene and polyethylene. Each process section in a polypropylene or polyethylene production process is a potential affected facility for both continuous and intermittent emissions. The applicability date depends on when the process section was constructed, modified, or reconstructed and, in some instances, on the type of production process.
              (i) The applicability date for any polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility that is constructed, modified, or reconstructed after January 10, 1989, regardless of the type of production process being used, is January 10, 1989.
              (ii) Only some polypropylene or polyethylene process sections that are constructed, modified, or reconstructed on or before January 10, 1989, but after September 30, 1987, are affected facilities. These process sections (and the type of emissions to be controlled) are identified by an “x” in table 1. The applicability date for the process sections (and the emissions to be controlled) that are identified by an “x” in table 1 is September 30, 1987. Since the affected facilities that have a September 30, 1987, applicability date are determined by the type of production process (e.g., liquid phase, gas phase), each owner or operator shall identify the particular production process that applies to his or her particular process.

                  a “Uncontrolled emission rate” refers to the emission rate of a vent stream that vents directly to the atmosphere and to the emission rate of a vent stream to the atmosphere that would occur in the absence of any add-on control devices but after any material recovery devices that constitute part of the normal material recovery operations in a process line where potential emissions are recovered for recycle or resale.
                
                  b Emission rate applies to continuous emissions only.
                
                  c Emission rate applies to intermittent emissions only.
                
                  d Total emission rate for non-emergency intermittent emissions from raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery, product finishing, and product storage process sections.
                
                  e See footnote d.
                
                  f Emission rate applies to both continuous and intermittent emissions.
                
                  g Emission rate applies to non-emergency intermittent emissions only.
                
                  h Applies to modified or reconstructed affected facilities only.
                
                  i Includes emissions from the cooling water tower.
                
                  j Applies to a process line producing low viscosity poly(ethylene terephthlalate).

                  l See footnote m.
                
                  m Applies to the sum of emissions to the atmosphere from the polymerization reaction section (including emissions from the cooling tower) and the raw materials preparation section (i.e., the esterifiers).
              
              (e)(1) Modified or reconstructed affected facilities at polystyrene and poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants with uncontrolled emission rates at or below those identified in table 2 are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1 unless and until its uncontrolled emission rate exceeds that rate listed for it in table 2. This exemption does not apply to new polystyrene or poly(ethylene terephthalate) affected facilities.
              (2) Emissions from modified or reconstructed affected facilities that are controlled by an existing control device and that have uncontrolled emission rates greater than the uncontrolled threshold emission rates identified in table 2 are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1 unless and until the existing control device is modified, reconstructed, or replaced.
              (f) No process section of an experimental process line is considered an affected facility for continuous or intermittent process emissions.
              (g) Individual vent streams that emit continuous emissions with uncontrolled annual emissions of less than 1.6 Mg/yr (1.76 ton/yr) or with a weight percent TOC of less than 0.10 percent from a new, modified, or reconstructed polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1(a)(1). If at a later date, an individual stream's uncontrolled annual emissions become 1.6 Mg/yr (1.76 ton/yr) or greater (if the stream was exempted on the basis of the uncontrolled annual emissions exemption) or VOC concentration becomes 0.10 weight percent or higher (if the stream was exempted on the basis of the VOC concentration exemption), then the stream is subject to the requirements of § 60.562-1.
              (h) Emergency vent streams, as defined in § 60.561, from a new, modified, or reconstructed polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility are exempt from the requirements of § 60.562-1(a)(2).
              (i) An owner or operator of a polypropylene or polyethylene affected facility that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 30, 1987, and on or before January 10, 1989, and that is in a process line in which more than one type of polyolefin (i.e., polypropylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, or their copolymers) is produced shall select one of the polymer/production process combinations in table 1 for purposes of determining applicable affected facilities and uncontrolled threshold emissions rates.
              (j) Alternative means of compliance—(1) Option to comply with part 65. Owners or operators may choose to comply with 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, for continuous process vents that are subject to this subpart, that choose to comply with § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), or (C) as allowed in § 60.562-1(a)(1) and (b)(1)(iii). The requirements of 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 60.563 through 60.566, except for § 60.565(g)(1).

                Capital expenditure means, in addition to the definition in 40 CFR 60.2, an expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing facility that exceeds P, the product of the facility's replacement cost, R, and an adjusted annual asset guideline repair allowance, A, as reflected by the following equation: P = R × A, where
              (a) The adjusted annual asset guideline repair allowance, A, is the product of the percent of the replacement cost, Y, and the applicable basic annual asset guideline repair allowance, B, as reflected by the following equation: A = Y × (B ÷ 100);
              (b) The percent Y is determined from the following equation: Y = 1.0 − 0.57 log X, where X is 1986 minus the year of construction; and

                Decomposition means, for the purposes of these standards, an event in a polymerization reactor that advances to the point where the polymerization reaction becomes uncontrollable, the polymer begins to break down (decompose), and it becomes necessary to relieve the reactor instantaneously in order to avoid catastrophic equipment damage or serious adverse personnel safety consequences.
              
                Decomposition emissions refers to those emissions released from a polymer production process as the result of a decomposition or during attempts to prevent a decomposition.

This includes intermittent vents that occur from process equipment where normal operating parameters (e.g., pressure or temperature) are exceeded such that the process equipment can not be returned to normal operating conditions using the design features of the system and venting must occur to avoid equipment failure or adverse safety personnel consequences and to minimize adverse effects of the runaway reaction. This does not include intermittent vents that are designed into the process to maintain normal operating conditions of process vessels including those vents that regulate normal process vessel pressure.
              
                End finisher means a polymerization reaction vessel operated under very low pressures, typically at pressures of 2 mm Hg (1 in. H2O) or less, in order to produce high viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate). An end finisher is preceded in a high viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line by one or more polymerization vessels operated under less severe vacuums, typically between 5 and 10 mm Hg (3 and 5 in. H2O). A high viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line may have one or more end finishers.
              
                Existing control device means, for the purposes of these standards, an air pollution control device that has been in operation on or before September 30, 1987, or that has been in operation between September 30, 1987, and January 10, 1989, on those continuous or intermittent emissions from a process section that is marked by an “—” in table 1 of this subpart.

                Expandable polystyrene means a polystyrene bead to which a blowing agent has been added using either an in-situ suspension process or a post-impregnation suspension process.
              
                Experimental process line means a polymer or copolymer manufacturing process line with the sole purpose of operating to evaluate polymer manufacturing processes, technologies, or products. An experimental process line does not produce a polymer or resin that is sold or that is used as a raw material for nonexperimental process lines.
              
                Flame zone means that portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler occupied by the flame envelope.
              
                Fugitive emissions equipment means each pump, compressor, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, and flange or other connector in VOC service and any devices or systems required by subpart VV of this part.
              
                Gas phase process means a polymerization process in which the polymerization reaction is carried out in the gas phase; i.e., the monomer(s) are gases in a fluidized bed of catalyst particles and granular polymer.
              
                High density polyethylene (HDPE) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent ethylene by weight and having a density of greater than 0.940 gm/cm33 (58.7 lb/ft3).

                Liquid phase process means a polymerization process in which the polymerization reaction is carried out in the liquid phase; i.e., the monomer(s) and any catalyst are dissolved, or suspended in a liquid solvent.
              
                Liquid phase slurry process means a liquid phase polymerization process in which the monomer(s) are in solution (completely dissolved) in a liquid solvent, but the polymer is in the form of solid particles suspended in the liquid reaction mixture during the polymerization reaction; sometimes called a particle form process.

                Material recovery section means the equipment that recovers unreacted or by-product materials from any process section for return to the process line, off-site purification or treatment, or sale. Equipment designed to separate unreacted or by-product material from the polymer product are to be included in this process section, provided at least some of the material is recovered for reuse in the process, off-site purification or treatment, or sale, at the time the process section becomes an affected facility. Otherwise such equipment are to be assigned to one of the other process sections, as appropriate. Equipment that treats recovered materials are to be included in this process section, but equipment that also treats raw materials are not to be included in this process section. The latter equipment are to be included in the raw materials preparation section. If equipment is used to return unreacted or by-product material directly to the same piece of process equipment from which it was emitted, then that equipment is considered part of the process section that contains the process equipment. If equipment is used to recover unreacted or by-product material from a process section and return it to another process section or a different piece of process equipment in the same process section or sends it off-site for purification, treatment, or sale, then such equipment are considered part of a material recovery section. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are not included in the material recovery section, but are covered under the standards applicable to the polymerization reaction section (§ 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(A) or (2)(ii)(A)).
              
                Operating day means, for the purposes of these standards, any calendar day during which equipment used in the manufacture of polymer was operating for at least 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is shorter. Only operating days shall be used in determining compliance with the standards specified in § 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C). Any calendar day in which equipment is used for less than 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is less, is not an “operating day” and shall not be used as part of the rolling 14-day period for determining compliance with the standards specified in § 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C).
              
                Polyethylene means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent ethylene by weight; see low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene.

                Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using dimethyl terephthalate means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) based on the esterification of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with ethylene glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.
              
                Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using terephthalic acid means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) based on the esterification reaction of terephthalic acid (TPA) with ethylene glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.
              
                Polymerization reaction section means the equipment designed to cause monomer(s) to react to form polymers, including equipment designed primarily to cause the formation of short polymer chains (oligomers or low polymers), but not including equipment designed to prepare raw materials for polymerization, e.g., esterification vessels. For the purposes of these standards, the polymerization reaction section begins with the equipment used to transfer the materials from the raw materials preparation section and ends with the last vessel in which polymerization occurs. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are included in this process section, rather than in the material recovery process section.
              
                Polypropylene (PP) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent propylene by weight.
              
                Polystyrene (PS) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of at least 80 percent styrene or para-methylstyrene by weight.
              
                Post-impregnation suspension process means a manufacturing process in which polystyrene beads are first formed in a suspension process, washed, dried, or otherwise finished and then added with a blowing agent to another reactor in which the beads and blowing agent are reacted to produce expandable polystyrene.
              
                Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel to fluids contained in tubular coils, including all fluids except water that is heated to produce steam.
              
                Process line means a group of equipment assembled that can operate independently if supplied with sufficient raw materials to produce polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable) or poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process line consists of the equipment in the following process sections (to the extent that these process sections are present at a plant): raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, product finishing, product storage, and material recovery.
              
                Process section means the equipment designed to accomplish a general but well-defined task in polymer production. Process sections include raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery, product finishing, and product storage and may be dedicated to a single process line or common to more than one process line.
              
                Process unit means equipment assembled to perform any of the physical and chemical operations in the production of polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable), or poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process unit can operate independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient storage facilities for the product. Examples of process units are raw materials handling and monomer recovery.
              
                Product finishing section means the equipment that treats, shapes, or modifies the polymer or resin to produce the finished end product of the particular facility, including equipment that prepares the product for product finishing. For the purposes of these standards, the product finishing section begins with the equipment used to transfer the polymerized product from the polymerization reaction section and ends with the last piece of equipment that modifies the characteristics of the polymer. Product finishing equipment may accomplish product separation, extruding and pelletizing, cooling and drying, blending, additives introduction, curing, or annealing. Equipment used to separate unreacted or by-product material from the product are to be included in this process section, provided the material separated from the polymer product is not recovered at the time the process section becomes an affected facility. If the material is being recovered, then the separation equipment are to be included in the material recovery section. Product finishing does not include polymerization, the physical mixing of the pellets to obtain a homogenous mixture of the polymer (except as noted below), or the shaping (such as fiber spinning, molding, or fabricating) or modification (such as fiber stretching and crimping) of the finished end product. If physical mixing occurs in equipment located between product finishing equipment (i.e., before all the chemical and physical characteristics have been “set” by virtue of having passed through the last piece of equipment in the product finishing section), then such equipment are to be included in this process section. Equipment used to physically mix the finished product that are located after the last piece of equipment in the product finishing section are part of the product storage section.
              
                Product storage section means the equipment that is designed to store the finished polymer or resin end product of the particular facility. For the purposes of these standards, the product storage section begins with the equipment used to transfer the finished product out of the product finishing section and ends with the containers used to store the final product. Any equipment used after the product finishing section to recover unreacted or by-product material are to be considered part of a material recovery section. Product storage does not include any intentional modification of the characteristics of any polymer or resin product, but does include equipment that provide a uniform mixture of product, provided such equipment are used after the last product finishing piece of equipment. This process section also does not include the shipment of a finished polymer or resin product to another facility for further finishing or fabrication.
              
                Raw materials preparation section means the equipment located at a polymer manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as monomers and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of these standards, this process section begins with the equipment used to transfer raw materials from storage and recovered material from material recovery process sections, and ends with the last piece of equipment that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw materials preparation section may include equipment that accomplishes purification, drying, or other treatment of raw materials or of raw and recovered materials together, activation of catalysts, and esterification including the formation of some short polymer chains (oligomers), but does not include equipment that is designed primarily to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the treatment of recovered materials alone, or the storage of raw materials.
              
                Recovery system means an individual unit or series of material recovery units, such as absorbers, condensers, and carbon adsorbers, used for recovering volatile organic compounds.
              
                Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured according to the procedures specified in § 60.564.
              
                Vent stream means any gas stream released to the atmosphere directly from an emission source or indirectly either through another piece of process equipment or a material recovery device that constitutes part of the normal recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential emissions are recovered for recycle or resale, and any gas stream directed to an air pollution control device. The emissions released from an air pollution control device are not considered a vent stream unless, as noted above, the control device is part of the normal material recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential emissions are recovered for recycle or resale.
              
                Volatile organic compounds (VOC) means, for the purposes of these standards, any reactive organic compounds as defined in § 60.2 Definitions.

              § 60.562-1
              Standards: Process emissions.
              (a) Polypropylene, low density polyethylene, and high density polyethylene. Each owner or operator of a polypropylene, low density polyethylene, or high density polyethylene process line containing a process section subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup whichever comes first.
              (1) Continuous emissions. For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in § 60.560(a)(1), the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section for determining which continuous emissions are to be controlled and which level of control listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is to be met. The owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section each time a process section is constructed, modified, or reconstructed at the plant site.
              (i) Level of control Continuous emission streams determined to be subject to control pursuant to the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, as applicable, shall meet one of the control levels identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of this section. The procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section identify which level of control may be met. The level of control identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section is limited to certain continuous emission streams, which are identified through the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
              (A) Reduce emissions of total organic compounds (minus methane and ethane) (TOC) by 98 weight percent, or to a concentration of 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) on a dry basis, whichever is less stringent. The TOC is expressed as the sum of the actual compounds, not carbon equivalents. If an owner or operator elects to comply with the 20 ppmv standard, the concentration shall include a correction to 3 percent oxygen only when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the vent stream.
              (B) Combust the emissions in a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater by introducing the vent stream into the flame zone of the boiler or process heater. (Note: A boiler or process heater of lesser design heat capacity may be used, but must demonstrate compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section.)
              (C) Combust the emissions in a flare that meets the conditions specified in § 60.18. If the flare is used to control both continuous and intermittent emissions, the flare shall meet the conditions specified in § 60.18 at all times (i.e., which controlling continuous emissions alone or when controlling both continuous and intermittent emissions).
              (D) Vent the emissions to a control device located on the plant site.
              (ii) Uncontrolled Continuous Emissions. For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in § 60.560(a)(1) and that is not controlled in an existing control device, the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in table 3 to identify those continuous emissions from each constructed, modified, or reconstructed affected facility that are to be controlled. The owner shall include in the procedure all uncontrolled continuous vent streams from previously constructed, modified, or reconstructed affected facilities at the plant site each time a process section is constructed, modified, or reconstructed at the plant site. In applying the procedures shown in table 3, the stream characteristics may be either measured or calculated as specified in § 60.564(d). For modified or reconstructed affected facilities, these stream characteristics are to be determined after a modification or reconstruction determination has been made by the Administrator, but before any actual changes have been undertaken, and then again after the actual changes have been made. Figure 1 provides a summary overview of the control determination procedure described in table 3.

              (iii) Controlled Continuous Emissions. For each vent stream that emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in § 60.560(a)(1) and that is controlled in an existing control device, each owner or operator shall determine whether the emissions entering the control device are greater than or equal to the calculated threshold emissions (CTE) level, which is to be calculated using the TOC concentration of the inlet vent stream and the equations in footnote b of table 3. If the inlet stream's TOC concentration is equal to or greater than 20 weight percent, the calculated threshold emissions level is 18.2 Mg/yr (20.1 ton/yr). If multiple emission streams are vented to the control device, the individual streams are not to be separated into individual weight percent ranges for calculation purposes as would be done for uncontrolled emission streams. Emissions vented to an existing control device are required to be controlled as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. Figure 2 illustrates the control determination procedure for controlled continuous emissions.
              
                
                EC01JN92.049
              

              (A) If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device are equal to or greater than the CTE levels, then compliance with one of the requirements identified in § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) is required at such time the control device is reconstructed or replaced or has its operating conditions modified as a result of State or local regulations (including changes in the operating permit) including those instances where the control device is reconstructed, replaced, or modified in its operation at the same time the existing process section is modified or reconstructed and becomes an affected facility. If the existing control device already complies with one of the requirements identified in § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C), no further control is required.
              (B) If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device are less than the CTE level, then the requirements of § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) are not applicable at that time. However, if the control device is replaced, reconstructed, or modified at a later date, each owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of these standards. This is done by combining with the vent stream entering the control device any uncontrolled vent streams in the same weight percent range as the controlled vent stream and determining whether the annual emissions of the stream entering the control device plus the applicable uncontrolled vent streams are greater than or equal to the CTE level, which is based on the weighted TOC concentration of the controlled vent stream and the uncontrolled vent streams. If the annual emissions entering the control device (including the applicable uncontrolled vent streams) are greater than or equal to the CTE level, then compliance with one of the requirements identified in § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) is required at that time for both the controlled and uncontrolled vent streams. If the annual emissions are less than the CTE level, compliance with these standards is again not required at such time. However, if the control device is again replaced, reconstructed, or modified, each owner or operator shall repeat this determination procedure.
              (2) Intermittent emissions. The owner or operator shall control each vent stream that emits intermittent emissions from an affected facility as defined in § 60.560-1(a)(1) by meeting one of the control requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. If a vent stream that emits intermittent emissions is controlled in an existing flare, incinerator, boiler, or process heater, the requirements of this paragraph are waived until such time the control device is reconstructed or replaced or is modified in its operating conditions as a result of State or local regulation, including changes in the operating permit. This paragraph does not apply to emergency vent streams exempted by § 60.560(h) and as defined in § 60.561.
              (i) Combust the emissions in a flare that is:
              (A) Designed for and operated with no visible emissions, except for periods not to exceed a total of 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive hours,
              (B) Operated with a flame present at all times, and
              (C) Designed to maintain a stable flame.
              (ii) Combust the emissions in an incinerator, boiler, or process heater. Such emissions shall be introduced into the flame zone of a boiler or process heater.
              (b) Polystyrene. Each owner or operator of a polystyrene process line containing process sections subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup, whichever comes first. Each owner or operator of a polystyrene process line using a continuous process shall:
              (1) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section by complying with one of the following:
              (i) Not allow continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.0036 kg TOC/Mg (0.0072 lb TOC/ton) product; or
              (ii) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final condenser in the material recovery section to exceed −25 °C (−13 °F). For purposes of this standard, temperature excursions above this limit shall not be considered a violation when such excursions occur during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction; or
              (iii) Comply with § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C).

              (2) If continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section are routed through an existing emergency vapor recovery system, then compliance with these standards is required when the emergency vapor recovery system undergoes modification, reconstruction, or replacement. In such instances, compliance with these standards shall be achieved no later than 180 days after completion of the modification, reconstruction, or replacement.
              (c) Poly(ethylene terephthalate). Each owner or operator of a poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line containing process sections subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup, whichever comes first.
              (1) Each owner or operator of a PET process line using a dimethyl terephthalate process shall:
              (i) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section (i.e., methanol recovery) by complying with one of the following:
              (A) Not allow the continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.018 kg TOC/Mg (0.036 lb TOC/ton) product; or
              (B) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final condenser in the material recovery section (i.e., methanol recovery) to exceed +3 °C (+37 °F). For purposes of this standard, temperature excursions above this limit shall not be considered a violation when such excursions occur during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
              (ii) Limit the continuous TOC emissions and, if steam-jet ejectors are used to provide vacuum to the polymerization reactors, the ethylene glycol concentration from the polymerization reaction section by complying with the appropriate standard set forth below. The ethylene glycol concentration limits specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section shall be determined by the procedures specified in § 60.564(j).
              (A) Not allow continuous TOC emissions from the polymerization reaction section (including emissions from any equipment used to further recover the ethylene glycol, but excluding those emissions from the cooling tower) to be greater than 0.02 kg TOC/Mg (0.04 lb TOC/ton) product; and
              (B) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a low viscosity product is being produced using single or multiple end finishers or a high viscosity product is being produced using a single end finisher, maintain the concentration of ethylene glycol in the liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization reaction section at or below 0.35 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days; or
              (C) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a high viscosity product is being produced using multiple end finishers, maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling tower at or below 6.0 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days.
              (2) Each owner or operator of a PET process line using a terephthalic acid process shall:
              (i) Not allow the continuous TOC emissions from the esterification vessels in the raw materials preparation section to be greater than 0.04 kg TOC/Mg (0.08 lb TOC/ton) product.
              (ii) Limit the continuous TOC emissions and, if steam-jet ejectors are used to provide vaccum to the polymerization reactors, the ethylene glycol concentration from the polymerization reaction section by complying with the appropriate standard set forth below. The ethylene glycol concentration limits specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section shall be determined by the procedures specified in § 60.564(j).
              (A) Not allow continuous TOC emissions from the polymerization reaction section (including emissions from any equipment used to further recover the ethylene glycol, but excluding those emissions from the cooling tower) to be greater than 0.02 kg TOC/Mg (0.04 lb TOC/ton) product; and

              (B) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a low viscosity product is being produced using single or multiple end finishers or a high viscosity product is being produced using a single end finisher, maintain the concentration of ethylene glycol in the liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization reaction section at or below 0.35 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days; or
              (C) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a high viscosity product is being produced using multiple end finishers, maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling tower at or below 6.0 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days.
              (d) Closed vent systems and control devices used to comply with this subpart shall be operated at all times when emissions may be vented to them.
              (e) Vent systems that contain valves that could divert a vent stream from a control device shall have car-sealed opened all valves in the vent system from the emission source to the control device and car-sealed closed all valves in vent system that would lead the vent stream to the atmosphere, either directly or indirectly, bypassing the control device.

              (a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements specified in § 60.482-1 through § 60.482-10 as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days after initial startup, except that indications of liquids dripping from bleed ports in existing pumps in light liquid service are not considered to be a leak as defined in § 60.482-2(b)(2). For purposes of this standard, a “bleed port” is a technologically-required feature of the pump whereby polymer fluid used to provide lubrication and/or cooling of the pump shaft exits the pump, thereby resulting in a visible leak of fluid. This exemption expires when the existing pump is replaced or reconstructed.
              (b) An owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements specified in §§ 60.483-1 and 60.483-2.
              (c) An owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for a determination of equivalency for any means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of VOC at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of VOC achieved by the controls required in this subpart. In doing so, the owner or operator shall comply with requirements specified in § 60.484.
              (d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions specified in § 60.485 except an owner or operator may use the following provision in addition to § 60.485(e): Equipment is in light liquid service if the percent evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 °C (302 °F) as determined by ASTM Method D86-78, 82, 90, 95, or 96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17).

              (5) A specific gravity monitoring device to measure and record continuously to within 0.02 specific gravity unit.
              (b) The owner or operator shall install, as applicable, the monitoring equipment for the control means used to comply with § 60.562-1, except § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(D), as follows:
              (1) If the control equipment is an incinerator:

                Mj = Molecular weight of sample TOC component “j” of the gas stream, g/g-mole (1b/1b-mole).

If the carrier component of the gas stream is air, then an average molecular weight of 29 g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole) may be used in lieu of testing.
              (iii) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute intervals.

Method 1 or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the sampling site to the inlet of the flare. Using this same sample, ASTM D1946-77 or 90 (Reapproved 1994) (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the hydrogen and carbon monoxide content.

              (1) If applicable, the net heating value (HT) of the process vent shall be determined according to the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section to determine the applicable velocity requirements.
              (2) If applicable, the maximum permitted velocity (Vmax) for steam-assisted and nonassisted flares shall be computed using the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.022

                Vmax = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec (ft/sec).
                K6 = 8.706 m/sec (metric units)
                 = 28.56 ft/sec (English units)
                K7 = 0.7084 [(m/sec)/MJ/scm)] (metric units)
                 = 0.00245 [(ft/sec)/Btu/scf)] (English units)
                HT = The net heating value as determined in paragraph (f) of this section, MJ/scm (Btu/scf).
              
              
              (4) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by dividing the volumetric flow rate (in units of standard temperature and pressure), as determined by Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D as appropriate, by the unobstructed (free) cross sectional area of the flare tip.

              (2) The mass rate of TOC, ETOC, shall be determined according to the procedures, as appropriate, in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The sampling site for determining compliance with §§ 60.560 (d) and (e) shall be before any add-on control devices and after all product recovery devices.

              (i) The owner or operator shall determine continuous compliance with the temperature requirements in §§ 60.562-1(b)(1)(ii) and 60.562-1(c)(1)(i)(B) by using the temperature monitoring equipment described in § 60.563(a)(1). An average temperature shall be determined from measurements taken at least every 15 minutes every three hours while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted. Each three-hour period constitutes a performance test.
              (j) For purposes of determining compliance with § 60.562-1(c) (1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), or (2)(ii)(C), the ethylene glycol concentration in either the cooling tower or the liquid effluent from steam-jet ejectors used to produce a vacuum in the polymerization reactors, whichever is applicable, shall be determined:
              (1) Using procedures that conform to the methods described in ASTM D2908-74 or 91, “Standard Practice for Measuring Volatile Organic Matter in Water by Aqueous-Injection Gas Chromatography” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17), except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section:
              (i) At least one sample per operating day shall be collected using the grab sampling procedures of ASTM D3370-76 or 96a, “Standard Practices for Sampling Water” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17). An average ethylene glycol concentration by weight shall be calculated on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days, except as provided in paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section. Each daily average ethylene glycol concentration so calculated constitutes a performance test. Exceedance of the standard during the reduced testing program specified in paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section is a violation of these standards.
              (ii) For those determining compliance with § 60.562-1(c) (1)(ii)(B) or (2)(ii)(B), the owner or operator may elect to reduce the sampling program to any 14 consecutive day period once every two calendar months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling average concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling program are each less than 0.10 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the average concentration obtained over the 14 day sampling during the reduced testing period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day average exceeded 0.10 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. A reduced sampling program can be reinstituted if the requirements specified in this paragraph are met.
              (iii) For those determining compliance with § 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(C) or (c)(2)(ii)(C), the owner or operator may elect to reduce the sampling program to any 14 consecutive day period once every two calendar months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling average concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling program are each less than 1.8 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the average concentration obtained over the 14 day sampling during the reduced test period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day average exceeded 1.8 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. A reduced program can be reinstituted if the requirements specified in this paragraph are met.
              (iv) The upper 95 percent confidence interval shall be calculated using the equation:
              
                ER17OC00.025
              
              
                Where:
                
                Xi = daily ethylene glycol concentration for each day used to calculate the 14-day rolling average used in test results to justify implementing the reduced testing program.
                n = number of ethylene glycol concentrations.
              
              

              (2) Measuring an alternative parameter, such as carbon oxygen demand or biological oxygen demand, that is demonstrated to be directly proportional to the ethylene glycol concentration. Such parameter shall be measured during the initial 14-day performance test during which the facility is shown to be in compliance with the ethylene glycol concentration standard whereby the ethylene glycol concentration is determined using the procedures described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The alternative parameter shall be measured on a daily basis and the average value of the alternative parameter shall be calculated on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days. Each daily average value of the alternative parameter constitutes a performance test.

                EC01JN92.050
              
              (3) The weighted average VOC content of the inks shall be calculated over a period that does not exceed one calendar month, or four consecutive weeks. A facility that uses an accounting system based on quarters consisting of two 28 calendar day periods and one 35 calendar day period may use an averaging period of 35 calendar days four times per year, provided the use of such an accounting system is documented in the initial performance test.
              (4) Each determination of the weighted average VOC content shall constitute a performance test for any period when VOC emission control equipment is not used. Results of the initial performance test must be reported to the Administrator. Method 24 or ink manufacturers' formulation data along with plant blending records (if plant blending is done) may be used to determine VOC content. The Administrator may require the use of Method 24 if there is a question concerning the accuracy of the ink manufacturer's data or plant blending records.
              (5) If, during the time periods when emission control equipment is not used, all inks used contain less than 1.0 kilogram VOC per kilogram ink solids, the owner or operator is not required to calculate the weighted average VOC content, but must verify and record the VOC content of each ink (including any added dilution solvent) used as determined by Method 24, ink manufacturers' formulation data, or plant blending records.
              (c) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.582(a)(1), the owner or operator may determine the weighted average VOC content using an inventory system.
              (1) The inventory system shall accurately account to the nearest kilogram for the VOC content of all inks and dilution solvent used, recycled, and discarded for each affected facility during the averaging period. Separate records must be kept for each affected facility.
              (2) To determine VOC content of inks and dilution solvent used or recycled, Method 24 or ink manufacturers' formulation data must be used in combination with plant blending records (if plant blending is done) or inventory records or purchase records for new inks or dilution solvent.

              (3) For inks to be discarded, only Method 24 shall be used to determine the VOC content. Inks to be discarded may be combined prior to measurement of volume or weight and testing by Method 24.
              
              (4) The Administrator may require the use of Method 24 if there is a question concerning the accuracy of the ink manufacturer's data or plant records.
              (5) The Administrator shall approve the inventory system of accounting for VOC content prior to the initial performance test.
              (d) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.582(a)(2), the owner or operator of an affected facility controlled by a solvent recovery emission control device or an incineration control device shall conduct a performance test to determine overall VOC emission control efficiency according to the following procedures:
              (1) The performance test shall consist of three runs. Each test run must last a minimum of 30 minutes and shall continue until the printing operation is interrupted or until 180 minutes of continuous operation occurs. During each test run, the print line shall be printing continuously and operating normally. The VOC emission reduction efficiency achieved for each test run is averaged over the entire test run period.
              (2) VOC concentration values at each site shall be measured simultaneously.
              (3) The volumetric flow rate shall be determined from one Method 2 measurement for each test run conducted immediately prior to, during, or after that test run. Volumetric flow rates at each site do not need to be measured simultaneously.
              (4) In order to determine capture efficiency from an affected facility, all fugitive VOC emissions from the affected facility shall be captured and vented through stacks suitable for measurement. During a performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility located in an area with other sources of VOC shall isolate the affected facility from other sources of VOC. These two requirements shall be accomplished using one of the following methods:
              (i) Build a permanent enclosure around the affected facility;
              (ii) Build a temporary enclosure around the affected facility and duplicate, to an extent that is reasonably feasible, the ventilation conditions that are in effect when the affected facility is not enclosed (one way to do this is to divide the room exhaust rate by the volume of the room and then duplicate that quotient or 20 air changes per hour, whichever is smaller, in the temporary enclosure); or
              (iii) Shut down all other sources of VOC and continue to exhaust fugitive emissions from the affected facility through any building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as print line ovens and embossers.
              (5) For each affected facility, compliance with § 60.582(a)(2) has been demonstrated if the average value of the overall control efficiency (EF) for the three runs is equal to or greater than 85 percent. An overall control efficiency is calculated for each run as follows:
              (i) For efficiency of the emission control device,
              
                EC01JN92.051

              § 60.592
              Standards.
              (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements of §§ 60.482-1 to 60.482-10 as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days after initial startup.
              (b) For a given process unit, an owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section as an alternative to the requirements in § 60.482-7.

              (2) Comply with § 60.483-2.
              (3) Comply with the Phase III provisions in 40 CFR 63.168, except an owner or operator may elect to follow the provisions in § 60.482-7(f) instead of 40 CFR 63.168 for any valve that is designated as being leakless.
              (c) An owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for a determination of equivalency for any means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of VOC at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of VOC achieved by the controls required in this subpart. In doing so, the owner or operator shall comply with requirements of § 60.484.
              (d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions of § 60.485 except as provided in § 60.593.

              § 60.593
              Exceptions.
              (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart may comply with the following exceptions to the provisions of subpart VV.
              (b)(1) Compressors in hydrogen service are exempt from the requirements of § 60.592 if an owner or operator demonstrates that a compressor is in hydrogen service.
              (2) Each compressor is presumed not to be in hydrogen service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is in hydrogen service. For a piece of equipment to be considered in hydrogen service, it must be determined that the percent hydrogen content can be reasonably expected always to exceed 50 percent by volume. For purposes of determining the percent hydrogen content in the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a compressor, procedures that conform to the general method described in ASTM E260-73, 91, or 96, E168-67, 77, or 92, or E169-63, 77, or 93 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17) shall be used.

              (3)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than procedures in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to demonstrate that the percent content exceeds 50 percent by volume, provided the engineering judgment demonstrates that the content clearly exceeds 50 percent by volume. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is in hydrogen service, however, the procedures in paragraph (b)(2) shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
              
              (ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in hydrogen service, the determination can be revised only after following the procedures in paragraph (b)(2).
              (c) Any existing reciprocating compressor that becomes an affected facility under provisions of § 60.14 or § 60.15 is exempt from § 60.482-3(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) provided the owner or operator demonstrates that recasting the distance piece or replacing the compressor are the only options available to bring the compressor into compliance with the provisions of § 60.482-3(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h).
              (d) An owner or operator may use the following provision in addition to § 60.485(e): Equipment is in light liquid service if the percent evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 °C as determined by ASTM Method D86-78, 82, 90, 95, or 96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17).
              (e) Pumps in light liquid service and valves in gas/vapor and light liquid service within a process unit that is located in the Alaskan North Slope are exempt from the requirements of §§ 60.482-2 and 60.482-7.
              (f) Open-ended valves or lines containing asphalt as defined in § 60.591 are exempt from the requirements of § 60.482-6(a) through (c).

              Standards.
              (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements of §§ 60.482-1a to 60.482-10a as soon as practicable, but no later than 180 days after initial startup.
              (b) For a given process unit, an owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section as an alternative to the requirements in § 60.482-7a.
              (1) Comply with § 60.483-1a.
              (2) Comply with § 60.483-2a.
              (3) Comply with the Phase III provisions in § 63.168, except an owner or operator may elect to follow the provisions in § 60.482-7a(f) instead of § 63.168 for any valve that is designated as being leakless.
              (c) An owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for a determination of equivalency for any means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of VOC at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of VOC achieved by the controls required in this subpart. In doing so, the owner or operator shall comply with requirements of § 60.484a.
              (d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions of § 60.485a except as provided in § 60.593a.
              (e) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the provisions of §§ 60.486a and 60.487a.
            
            
              § 60.593a
              Exceptions.
              (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart may comply with the following exceptions to the provisions of subpart VVa of this part.
              (b)(1) Compressors in hydrogen service are exempt from the requirements of § 60.592a if an owner or operator demonstrates that a compressor is in hydrogen service.

              (2) Each compressor is presumed not to be in hydrogen service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is in hydrogen service. For a piece of equipment to be considered in hydrogen service, it must be determined that the percent hydrogen content can be reasonably expected always to exceed 50 percent by volume. For purposes of determining the percent hydrogen content in the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a compressor, procedures that conform to the general method described in ASTM E260-73, 91, or 96, E168-67, 77, or 92, or E169-63, 77, or 93 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17) shall be used.
              (3)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than procedures in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to demonstrate that the percent content exceeds 50 percent by volume, provided the engineering judgment demonstrates that the content clearly exceeds 50 percent by volume. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is in hydrogen service, however, the procedures in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
              (ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in hydrogen service, the determination can be revised only after following the procedures in paragraph (b)(2).
              (c) Any existing reciprocating compressor that becomes an affected facility under provisions of § 60.14 or § 60.15 is exempt from § 60.482-3a(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) provided the owner or operator demonstrates that recasting the distance piece or replacing the compressor are the only options available to bring the compressor into compliance with the provisions of § 60.482-3a(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h).
              (d) An owner or operator may use the following provision in addition to § 60.485a(e): Equipment is in light liquid service if the percent evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 °C as determined by ASTM Method D86-78, 82, 90, 93, 95, or 96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17).
              (e) Pumps in light liquid service and valves in gas/vapor and light liquid service within a process unit that is located in the Alaskan North Slope are exempt from the requirements of §§ 60.482-2a and 60.482-7a.
              (f) Open-ended valves or lines containing asphalt as defined in § 60.591a are exempt from the requirements of § 60.482-6a(a) through (c).
              (g) Connectors in gas/vapor or light liquid service are exempt from the requirements in § 60.482-11a, provided the owner or operator complies with § 60.482-8a for all connectors, not just those in heavy liquid service.

              § 60.602
              Standard for volatile organic compounds.

              On and after the date on which the initial performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause the discharge into the atmosphere from any affected facility that produces acrylic fibers, VOC emissions that exceed 10 kg/Mg (20 lb/ton) solvent feed to the spinning solution preparation system or precipitation bath. VOC emissions from affected facilities that produce both acrylic and nonacrylic fiber types shall not exceed 10 kg/Mg (20 lb/ton) solvent feed.

              § 60.603
              Performance test and compliance provisions.
              (a) Section 60.8(f) does not apply to the performance test procedures required by this subpart.
              (b) Each owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine compliance with the applicable standard in § 60.602(a) by determining and recording monthly the VOC emissions per unit mass solvent feed from each affected facility for the current and preceding 5 consecutive calendar months and using these values to calculate the 6-month average emissions. Each calculation is considered a performance test. The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use the following procedure to determine VOC emissions for each calendar month;
              (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices that continuously measure and permanently record for each calendar month the amount of makeup solvent and solvent feed. These values shall be used in calculating VOC emissions according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. All monitoring devices, meters, and peripheral equipment shall be calibrated and any error recorded. Total compounded error of the flow measuring and recording devices shall not exceed 1 percent accuracy over the operating range. As an alternative to measuring solvent feed, the owner or operator may:

              (i) Measure the amount of recovered solvent returned to the solvent feed storage tanks, and use the following equation to determine the amount of solvent feed:
              
              
                Solvent Feed = Makeup Solvent + Recovered
                Solvent + Change in the Amount of Solvent
                Contained in the Solvent Feed Holding Tank.
              
              
              (ii) Measure and record the amount of polymer introduced into the affected facility and the solvent-to-polymer ratio of the spinning solutions, and use the following equation to determine the amount of solvent feed:
              
                EC16NO91.083
              
              
                where subscript “i” denotes each particular spinning solution used during the test period; values of “i” vary from one to the total number of spinning solutions, “n,” used during the calendar month.
              
              
              (2) VOC emissions shall be determined each calendar month by use of the following equations:
              
                EC16NO91.084
              
              
                where all values are for the calendar month only and where
                E = VOC Emissions, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent;
                SV = Measured or calculated volume of solvent feed, in liters (gallons);
                SW = Weight of solvent feed, in Mg (ton);
                MV = Measured volume of makeup solvent, in liters (gallons);
                MW = Weight of makeup, in kg (lb);
                N = Allowance for nongaseous losses, 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed;
                SP = Fraction of measured volume that is actual solvent (excludes water);
                D = Density of the solvent, in kg/liter (lb/gallon);
                K = Conversion factor, 1,000 kg/Mg (2,000 lb/ton);
                I = Allowance for solvent inventory variation or changes in the amount of solvent contained in the affected facility, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent feed (may be positive or negative);
                IS = Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at the beginning of the test period, as determined by the owner or operator, in kg (lb);
                IE = Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at the close of the test period, as determined by the owner or operator, in kg (lb).
              
              

              (3) N, as used in the equation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, equals 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed to the spinning solution preparation system and precipitation bath. This value shall be used in all cases unless an owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that greater nongaseous losses occur at the affected facility. In this case, the greater value may be substituted in the equation.

              § 60.604
              Reporting requirements.
              (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall submit a written report to the Administrator of the following:
              (1) The results of the initial performance test; and
              (2) The results of subsequent performance tests that indicate that VOC emissions exceed the standards in § 60.602. These reports shall be submitted quarterly at 3-month intervals after the initial performance test. If no exceedances occur during a particular quarter, a report stating this shall be submitted to the Administrator semiannually.
              (b) Solvent-spun synthetic fiber producing facilities exempted from these standards in § 60.600(a) (those producing less than 500 Mg (551 ton) annually) shall report to the Administrator within 30 days whenever extruded fiber for the preceding 12 calendar months exceeds 500 Mg (551 ton).
              (c) The requirements of this section remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternate means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this section, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.

              (g) Each owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to comply with § 60.610(c) or § 60.612(c) shall recalculate the TRE index value for that affected facility whenever process changes are made. Some examples of process changes are changes in production capacity, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. The TRE index value shall be recalculated based on test data, or on best engineering estimates of the effects of the change to the recovery system.
              (1) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 1.0, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 1 week of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to the methods and procedures required by § 60.614 to determine compliance with § 60.612(a). Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
              (2) Where the initial TRE index value is greater than 4.0 and the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 4.0, but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test in accordance with §§ 60.8 and 60.614 and shall comply with §§ 60.613, 60.614, and 60.615. Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process change.

              § 60.615
              Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

              (a) Each owner or operator subject to § 60.612 shall notify the Administrator of the specific provisions of § 60.612 (§ 60.612 (a) (b), or (c)) with which the owner or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial start-up required by § 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or operator elects at a later date to use an alternative provision of § 60.612 with which he or she will comply, then the Administrator shall be notified by the owner or operator 90 days before implementing a change and, upon implementing the change, a performance test shall be performed as specified by § 60.614 within 180 days.
              (b) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of the following data measured during each performance test, and also include the following data in the report of the initial performance test required under § 60.8. Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used to comply with § 60.612(a), a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information of § 60.615(b)(2)(i) is required. The same data specified in this section shall be submitted in the reports of all subsequently required performance tests where either the emission control efficiency of a control device, outlet concentration of TOC, or the TRE index value of a vent stream from a recovery system is determined.
              (1) Where an owner or operator subject to this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(a) through use of either a thermal or catalytic incinerator:
              (i) The average firebox temperature of the incinerator (or the average temperature upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed for a catalytic incinerator), measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing, and
              (ii) The percent reduction of TOC determined as specified in § 60.614(b) achieved by the incinerator, or the concentration of TOC (ppmv, by compound) determined as specified in § 60.614(b) at the outlet of the control device on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen.
              (2) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(a) through use of a boiler or process heater:
              (i) A description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater, and
              (ii) The average combustion temperature of the boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr) measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing.
              (3) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to comply with § 60.612(b) through the use of a smokeless flare, flare design (i.e., steam-assisted, air-assisted, or nonassisted), all visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate measurements, and exit velocity determinations made during the performance test, continuous records of the flare pilot flame monitoring, and records of all periods of operations during which the pilot flame is absent.
              (4) Where an owner or operator seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(c):
              (i) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in a recovery system, the exit specific gravity (or alternative parameter which is a measure of the degree of absorbing liquid saturation, if approved by the Administrator), and average exit temperature of the absorbing liquid, measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted), or
              (ii) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in a recovery system, the average exit (product side) temperature, measured at least every 15 minutes and average over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.

              (iii) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in a recovery system, the total steam mass flow measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance test (full carbon bed cycle), temperature of the carbon bed after regeneration (and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle(s), and duration of the carbon bed steaming cycle (all measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted), or
              (iv) As an alternative to § 60.615(b)(4)(i), (ii) or (iii), the concentration level or reading indicated by the organic monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.
              (v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream.
              (c) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 60.613(a) and (c) as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where a combustion device is used by an owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(a) or (c), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:
              (1) For thermal incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.612(a) was determined.
              (2) For catalytic incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average temperature of the vent stream immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average temperature of the vent stream during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.612(a) was determined. The owner or operator also shall record all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the device during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.612(a) was determined.
              (3) All 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.612(a) was determined for boilers or process heaters with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr).

              (g) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 60.613(e) as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where the owner or operator seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.612(c), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:
              (1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in a recovery system, and where an organic monitoring device is not used:

              § 60.624
              Test methods and procedures.
              Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of § 60.622(a) shall perform an initial test to verify that the flow rate of recovered solvent from the solvent recovery dryer at the termination of the recovery cycle is no greater than 0.05 liters per minute. This test shall be conducted for a duration of no less than 2 weeks during which no less than 50 percent of the dryer loads shall be monitored for their final recovered solvent flow rate. The suggested point for measuring the flow rate of recovered solvent is the outlet of the solvent-water separator. Near the end of the recovery cycle, the entire flow of recovered solvent should be diverted to a graduated cylinder. As the recovered solvent collects in the graduated cylinder, the elapsed time is monitored and recorded in periods of greater than or equal to 1 minute. At the same time, the volume of solvent in the graduated cylinder is monitored and recorded to determine the volume of recovered solvent that is collected during each time period. The recovered solvent flow rate is calculated by dividing the volume of solvent collected per period by the length of time elapsed during the period and converting the result with appropriate factors into units of liters per minute. The recovery cycle and the monitoring procedure should continue until the flow rate of solvent is less than or equal to 0.05 liter per minute. The type of articles cleaned and the total length of the cycle should then be recorded.

              § 60.644
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in paragraph § 60.8(b).

              (b) During a performance test required by § 60.8, the owner or operator shall determine the minimum required reduction efficiencies (Z) of SO2 emissions as required in § 60.642 (a) and (b) as follows:
              (1) The average sulfur feed rate (X) shall be computed as follows:
              
                ER17OC00.030
              
              
                Where:
                
                X = average sulfur feed rate, Mg/D (LT/D).
                Qa = average volumetric flow rate of acid gas from sweetening unit, dscm/day (dscf/day).
                Y = average H2S concentration in acid gas feed from sweetening unit, percent by volume, expressed as a decimal.

                K = (32 kg S/kg-mole)/((24.04 dscm/kg-mole)(1000 kg S/ Mg)) = 1.331 × 10−3 Mg/dscm, for metric units
                 = (32 lb S/lb-mole)/((385.36 dscf/lb-mole)(2240 lb S/long ton))
                 = 3.707 × 10−5 long ton/dscf, for English units.
              
              

              (2) The continuous readings from the process flowmeter shall be used to determine the average volumetric flow rate (Qa) in dscm/day (dscf/day) of the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each run.

              (3) The Tutwiler procedure in § 60.648 or a chromatographic procedure following ASTM E-260 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the H2S concentration in the acid gas feed from the sweetening unit. At least one sample per hour (at equally spaced intervals) shall be taken during each 4-hour run. The arithmetic mean of all samples shall be the average H2S concentration (Y) on a dry basis for the run. By multiplying the result from the Tutwiler procedure by 1.62 × 10−3, the units gr/100 scf are converted to volume percent.

              (4) Using the information from paragraphs (b) (1) and (3), tables 1 and 2 shall be used to determine the required initial (Zi) and continuous (Zc) reduction efficiencies of SO2 emissions.

              (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the SO2 standards in § 60.642 (a) or (b) as follows:

              (1) The emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur recovery technology shall be computed for each run using the following equation:
              
              R = (100 S)/(S + E)
              
              (2) The level indicators or manual soundings shall be used to measure the liquid sulfur accumulation rate in the product storage tanks. Readings taken at the beginning and end of each run, the tank geometry, sulfur density at the storage temperature, and sample duration shall be used to determine the sulfur production rate (S) in kg/hr (lb/hr) for each run.
              (3) The emission rate of sulfur shall be computed for each run as follows:
              
                ER17OC00.031
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = emission rate of sulfur per run, kg/hr.
                Ce = concentration of sulfur equivalent (SO2 + reduced sulfur), g/dscm (lb/dscf).
                Qsd = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
                K1 = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (7000 gr/lb).
              
              
              (4) The concentration (Ce) of sulfur equivalent shall be the sum of the SO2 and TRS concentrations, after being converted to sulfur equivalents. For each run and each of the test methods specified in this paragraph (c) of this section, the sampling time shall be at least 4 hours. Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site. The sampling point in the duct shall be at the centroid of the cross-section if the area is less than 5 m2 (54 ft2) or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m (39 in.) if the cross-sectional area is 5 m2 or more, and the centroid is more than 1 m (39 in.) from the wall.
              (i) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO2 concentration. Eight samples of 20 minutes each shall be taken at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average shall be the concentration for the run. The concentration shall be multiplied by 0.5 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.

              (ii) Method 15 shall be used to determine the TRS concentration from reduction-type devices or where the oxygen content of the effluent gas is less than 1.0 percent by volume. The sampling rate shall be at least 3 liters/min (0.1 ft3/min) to insure minimum residence time in the sample line. Sixteen samples shall be taken at 15-minute intervals. The arithmetic average of all the samples shall be the concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm reduced sulfur as sulfur shall be multiplied by 1.333 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.

              (iii) Method 16A or 15 shall be used to determine the reduced sulfur concentration from oxidation-type devices or where the oxygen content of the effluent gas is greater than 1.0 percent by volume. Eight samples of 20 minutes each shall be taken at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average shall be the concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm reduced sulfur as sulfur shall be multiplied by 1.333 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.

              (iv) Method 2 shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate of the effluent gas. A velocity traverse shall be conducted at the beginning and end of each run. The arithmetic average of the two measurements shall be used to calculate the volumetric flow rate (Qsd) for the run. For the determination of the effluent gas molecular weight, a single integrated sample over the 4-hour period may be taken and analyzed or grab samples at 1-hour intervals may be taken, analyzed, and averaged. For the moisture content, two samples of at least 0.10 dscm (3.5 dscf) and 10 minutes shall be taken at the beginning of the 4-hour run and near the end of the time period. The arithmetic average of the two runs shall be the moisture content for the run.
              (d) To comply with § 60.646(d), the owner or operator shall obtain the information required by using the monitoring devices in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

              § 60.646
              Monitoring of emissions and operations.
              (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of § 60.642 (a) or (b) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices or perform measurements to determine the following operations information on a daily basis:
              (1) The accumulation of sulfur product over each 24-hour period: The monitoring method may incorporate the use of an instrument to measure and record the liquid sulfur production rate, or may be a procedure for measuring and recording the sulfur liquid levels in the storage tanks with a level indicator or by manual soundings, with subsequent calculation of the sulfur production rate based on the tank geometry, stored sulfur density, and elapsed time between readings. The method shall be designed to be accurate within ±2 percent of the 24-hour sulfur accumulation.
              (2) The H2S concentration in the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each 24-hour period: At least one sample per 24-hour period shall be collected and analyzed using the method specified in § 60.644(b)(1). The Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate that the H2S concentration obtained from one or more samples over a 24-hour period is within ±20 percent of the average of 12 samples collected at equally spaced intervals during the 24-hour period. In instances where the H2S concentration of a single sample is not within ±20 percent of the average of the 12 equally spaced samples, the Administrator may require a more frequent sampling schedule.
              (3) The average acid gas flow rate from the sweetening unit: The owner or operator shall install and operate a monitoring device to continuously measure the flow rate of acid gas. The monitoring device reading shall be recorded at least once per hour during each 24-hour period. The average acid gas flow rate shall be computed from the individual readings.
              (4) The sulfur feed rate (X): For each 24-hour period, X shall be computed using the equation in § 60.644(b)(3).

              (5) The required sulfur dioxide emission reduction efficiency for the 24-hour period: The sulfur feed rate and the H2S concentration in the acid gas for the 24-hour period as applicable, shall be used to determine the required reduction efficiency in accordance with the provisions of § 60.642(b).
              (b) Where compliance is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration device, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices and continuous emission monitors as follows:

              (1) A continuous monitoring system to measure the total sulfur emission rate (E) of SO2 in the gases discharged to the atmosphere. The SO2 emission rate shall be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system shall be set so that the equivalent emission limit of § 60.642(b) will be between 30 percent and 70 percent of the measurement range of the instrument system.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section: A monitoring device to measure the temperature of the gas leaving the combustion zone of the incinerator, if compliance with § 60.642(a) is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration device. The monitoring device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±1 percent of the temperature being measured.

              When performance tests are conducted under the provision of § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with the standards under § 60.642, the temperature of the gas leaving the incinerator combustion zone shall be determined using the monitoring device. If the volumetric ratio of sulfur dioxide to sulfur dioxide plus total reduced sulfur (expressed as SO2) in the gas leaving the incinerator is ≤0.98, then temperature monitoring may be used to demonstrate that sulfur dioxide emission monitoring is sufficient to determine total sulfur emissions. At all times during the operation of the facility, the owner or operator shall maintain the average temperature of the gas leaving the combustion zone of the incinerator at or above the appropriate level determined during the most recent performance test to ensure the sulfur compound oxidation criteria are met. Operation at lower average temperatures may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request that the minimum incinerator temperature be reestablished by conducting new performance tests under § 60.8.
              (3) Upon promulgation of a performance specification of continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery plants, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system for total reduced sulfur compounds as required in paragraph (d) of this section in addition to a sulfur dioxide emission monitoring system. The sum of the equivalent sulfur mass emission rates from the two monitoring systems shall be used to compute the total sulfur emission rate (E).

              (c) Where compliance is achieved through the use of a reduction control system not followed by a continually operated incineration device, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system to measure the emission rate of reduced sulfur compounds as SO2 equivalent in the gases discharged to the atmosphere. The SO2 equivalent compound emission rate shall be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system shall be set so that the equivalent emission limit of § 60.642(b) will be between 30 and 70 percent of the measurement range of the system. This requirement becomes effective upon promulgation of a performance specification for continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery plants.
              (d) For those sources required to comply with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the average sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved (R) shall be calculated for each 24-hour clock internal. The 24-hour interval may begin and end at any selected clock time, but must be consistent. The 24-hour average reduction efficiency (R) shall be computed based on the 24-hour average sulfur production rate (S) and sulfur emission rate (E), using the equation in § 60.644(c)(1).
              (1) Data obtained from the sulfur production rate monitoring device specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to determine S.
              (2) Data obtained from the sulfur emission rate monitoring systems specified in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section shall be used to calculate a 24-hour average for the sulfur emission rate (E). The monitoring system must provide at least one data point in each successive 15-minute interval. At least two data points must be used to calculate each 1-hour average. A minimum of 18 1-hour averages must be used to compute each 24-hour average.

              (e) In lieu of complying with (b) or (c) of this section, those sources with a design capacity of less than 152 Mg/D (150 LT/D) of H2S expressed as sulfur may calculate the sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved for each 24-hour period by:
              
                ER17OC00.032
              
              
                Where:
                
                R = The sulfur dioxide removal efficiency achieved during the 24-hour period, percent.
                K2 = Conversion factor, 0.02400 Mg/D per kg/hr (0.01071 LT/D per lb/hr).
                S = The sulfur production rate during the 24-hour period, kg/hr (lb/hr).
                X = The sulfur feed rate in the acid gas, Mg/D (LT/D).
              
              
              (f) The monitoring devices required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3) and (c) of this section shall be calibrated at least annually according to the manufacturer's specifications, as required by § 60.13(b).
              (g) The continuous emission monitoring systems required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (c) of this section shall be subject to the emission monitoring requirements of § 60.13 of the General Provisions. For conducting the continuous emission monitoring system performance evaluation required by § 60.13(c), Performance Specification 2 shall apply, and Method 6 shall be used for systems required by paragraph (b) of this section.

              § 60.647
              Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
              (a) Records of the calculations and measurements required in §§ 60.642 (a) and (b) and 60.646 (a) through (g) must be retained for at least 2 years following the date of the measurements by owners and operators subject to this subpart. This requirement is included under § 60.7(d) of the General Provisions.
              (b) Each owner or operator shall submit a written report of excess emissions to the Administrator semiannually. For the purpose of these reports, excess emissions are defined as:
              (1) Any 24-hour period (at consistent intervals) during which the average sulfur emission reduction efficiency (R) is less than the minimum required efficiency (Z).
              (2) For any affected facility electing to comply with the provisions of § 60.646(b)(2), any 24-hour period during which the average temperature of the gases leaving the combustion zone of an incinerator is less than the appropriate operating temperature as determined during the most recent performance test in accordance with the provisions of § 60.646(b)(2). Each 24-hour period must consist of at least 96 temperature measurements equally spaced over the 24 hours.

              (c) To certify that a facility is exempt from the control requirements of these standards, each owner or operator of a facility with a design capacity less that 2 LT/D of H2S in the acid gas (expressed as sulfur) shall keep, for the life of the facility, an analysis demonstrating that the facility's design capacity is less than 2 LT/D of H2S expressed as sulfur.

              (d) Each owner or operator who elects to comply with § 60.646(e) shall keep, for the life of the facility, a record demonstrating that the facility's design capacity is less than 150 LT/D of H2S expressed as sulfur.
              (e) The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of obligation to comply with paragraph (b) of this section, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.

              Optional procedure for measuring hydrogen sulfide in acid gas—Tutwiler Procedure. 1
                
              
              
                
                  1 Gas Engineers Handbook, Fuel Gas Engineering Practices, The Industrial Press, 93 Worth Street, New York, NY, 1966, First Edition, Second Printing, page 6/25 (Docket A-80-20-A, Entry II-I-67).
              
              (a) When an instantaneous sample is desired and H2S concentration is ten grains per 1000 cubic foot or more, a 100 ml Tutwiler burette is used. For concentrations less than ten grains, a 500 ml Tutwiler burette and more dilute solutions are used. In principle, this method consists of titrating hydrogen sulfide in a gas sample directly with a standard solution of iodine.
              (b) Apparatus. (See Figure 1.) A 100 or 500 ml capacity Tutwiler burette, with two-way glass stopcock at bottom and three-way stopcock at top which connect either with inlet tubulature or glass-stoppered cylinder, 10 ml capacity, graduated in 0.1 ml subdivision; rubber tubing connecting burette with leveling bottle.
              (c) Reagents. (1) Iodine stock solution, 0.1N. Weight 12.7 g iodine, and 20 to 25 g cp potassium iodide for each liter of solution. Dissolve KI in as little water as necessary; dissolve iodine in concentrated KI solution, make up to proper volume, and store in glass-stoppered brown glass bottle.

              (2) Standard iodine solution, 1 ml = 0.001771 g I. Transfer 33.7 ml of above 0.1N stock solution into a 250 ml volumetric flask; add water to mark and mix well. Then, for 100 ml sample of gas, 1 ml of standard iodine solution is equivalent to 100 grains H2S per cubic feet of gas.
              (3) Starch solution. Rub into a thin paste about one teaspoonful of wheat starch with a little water; pour into about a pint of boiling water; stir; let cool and decant off clear solution. Make fresh solution every few days.
              (d) Procedure. Fill leveling bulb with starch solution. Raise (L), open cock (G), open (F) to (A), and close (F) when solutions starts to run out of gas inlet. Close (G). Purge gas sampling line and connect with (A). Lower (L) and open (F) and (G). When liquid level is several ml past the 100 ml mark, close (G) and (F), and disconnect sampling tube. Open (G) and bring starch solution to 100 ml mark by raising (L); then close (G). Open (F) momentarily, to bring gas in burette to atmospheric pressure, and close (F). Open (G), bring liquid level down to 10 ml mark by lowering (L). Close (G), clamp rubber tubing near (E) and disconnect it from burette. Rinse graduated cylinder with a standard iodine solution (0.00171 g I per ml); fill cylinder and record reading. Introduce successive small amounts of iodine thru (F); shake well after each addition; continue until a faint permanent blue color is obtained. Record reading; subtract from previous reading, and call difference D.

              (e) With every fresh stock of starch solution perform a blank test as follows: introduce fresh starch solution into burette up to 100 ml mark. Close (F) and (G). Lower (L) and open (G). When liquid level reaches the 10 ml mark, close (G). With air in burette, titrate as during a test and up to same end point. Call ml of iodine used C. Then,
              
              Grains H2S per 100 cubic foot of gas = 100 (D—C)
              
              

              (f) Greater sensitivity can be attained if a 500 ml capacity Tutwiler burette is used with a more dilute (0.001N) iodine solution. Concentrations less than 1.0 grains per 100 cubic foot can be determined in this way. Usually, the starch-iodine end point is much less distinct, and a blank determination of end point, with H2S-free gas or air, is required.

                Note:
                The intent of these standards is to minimize the emissions of VOC through the application of best demonstrated technology (BDT). The numerical emission limits in these standards are expressed in terms of total organic compounds (TOC), measured as TOC less methane and ethane. This emission limit reflects the performance of BDT.

If an owner or operator elects at a later date to use an alternative provision of § 60.662 with which he or she will comply, then the Administrator shall be notified by the owner or operator 90 days before implementing a change and, upon implementing the change, a performance test shall be performed as specified by § 60.664 within 180 days.
              (b) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep an up-to-date, readily accessible record of the following data measured during each performance test, and also include the following data in the report of the initial performance test required under § 60.8. Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used to comply with § 60.662(a), a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information in § 60.665(b)(2)(i) is required. The same data specified in this section shall be submitted in the reports of all subsequently required performance tests where either the emission control efficiency of a control device, outlet concentration of TOC, or the TRE index value of a vent stream from a recovery system is determined.
              (1) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.662(a) through use of either a thermal or catalytic incinerator:
              (i) The average firebox temperature of the incinerator (or the average temperature upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed for a catalytic incinerator), measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing, and
              (ii) The percent reduction of TOC determined as specified in § 60.664(b) achieved by the incinerator, or the concentration of TOC (ppmv, by compound) determined as specified in § 60.664(b) at the outlet of the control device on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen.
              (2) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.662(a) through use of a boiler or process heater:
              (i) A description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater, and
              (ii) The average combustion temperature of the boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr) measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing.
              (3) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.662(b) through use of a smokeless flare, flare design (i.e., steam-assisted, air-assisted or nonassisted), all visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate measurements, and exit velocity determinations made during the performance test, continuous records of the flare pilot flame monitoring, and records of all periods of operations during which the pilot flame is absent.
              (4) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.662(c):
              (i) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the exit specific gravity (or alternative parameter which is a measure of the degree of absorbing liquid saturation, if approved by the Administrator), and average exit temperature, of the absorbing liquid measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted), or
              (ii) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the average exit (product side) temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally, or

              (iii) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the total steam mass flow measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance test (full carbon bed cycle), temperature of the carbon bed after regeneration (and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle(s)), and duration of the carbon bed steaming cycle (all measured while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally), or
              
              (iv) As an alternative to § 60.665(b)(4) ((i), (ii) or (iii), the concentration level or reading indicated by the organics monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber, measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.
              (v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream.
              (c) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 60.663 (a) and (c) as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where a combustion device is used to comply with § 60.662(a), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:
              (1) For thermal incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.662(a) was determined.

The owner or operator also shall record all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the device during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.662(a) was determined.
              (3) All 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.662(a) was determined for boilers or process heaters with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr).
              (4) For boilers or process heaters, whenever there is a change in the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone as required under § 60.662(a).

              (g) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 60.663(e), as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where an owner or operator seeks to comply with § 60.662(c), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:
              (1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in a recovery system, and where an organic compound monitoring device is not used:

              (4) Where an absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system and where an organic compound monitoring device is used, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average organic compound concentration level or reading of organic compounds in the exhaust gases is more than 20 percent greater than the exhaust gas organic compound concentration level or reading measured by the monitoring device during the most recent performance test.
              (h) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of this subpart and seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.662(c) shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of:
              (1) Any changes in production capacity, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or of any replacement, removal or addition of recovery equipment or a distillation unit;
              (2) Any recalculation of the TRE index value performed pursuant to § 60.664(g); and
              (3) The results of any performance test performed pursuant to the methods and procedures required by § 60.664(e).
              (i) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that seeks to comply with the requirements of this subpart by complying with the flow rate cutoff in § 60.660(c)(6) shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records to indicate that the vent stream flow rate is less than 0.008 scm/min (0.3 scf/min) and of any change in equipment or process operation that increases the operating vent stream flow rate, including a measurement of the new vent stream flow rate.
              (j) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that seeks to comply with the requirements of this subpart by complying with the design production capacity provision in § 60.660(c)(5) shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of any change in equipment or process operation that increases the design production capacity of the process unit in which the affected facility is located.

              (k) Each owner and operator subject to the provisions of this subpart is exempt from the quarterly reporting requirements contained in § 60.7(c) of the General Provisions.
              
              (l) Each owner or operator that seeks to comply with the requirements of this subpart by complying with the requirements of § 60.660 (c)(4), (c)(5), or (c)(6) or § 60.662 shall submit to the Administrator semiannual reports of the following recorded information. The initial report shall be submitted within 6 months after the initial start-up date.
              (1) Exceedances of monitored parameters recorded under § 60.665 (c) and (g).
              (2) All periods recorded under § 60.665(d) when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or has no flow rate.
              (3) All periods recorded under § 60.665(e) when the boiler or process heater was not operating.
              (4) All periods recorded under § 60.665(f) in which the pilot flame of the flare was absent.

              (5) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the operating vent stream flow rate above the low flow exemption level in § 60.660(c)(6), including a measurement of the new vent stream flow rate, as recorded under § 60.665(i). These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed with the same time period to verify the recalculated flow value and to obtain the vent stream characteristics of heating value and ETOC. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8 of the General Provisions. Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under the low capacity exemption status in § 60.660(c)(5), the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.662.

              (6) Any change in equipment or process operation, as recorded under paragraph (j) of this section, that increases the design production capacity above the low capacity exemption level in § 60.660(c)(5) and the new capacity resulting from the change for the distillation process unit containing the affected facility. These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow rate, heating value, and ETOC. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8. The facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.660(d) or § 60.662. If the facility chooses to comply with § 60.662, the facility may qualify for an exemption in § 60.660(c)(4) or (6).
              (7) Any recalculation of the TRE index value, as recorded under § 60.665(h).
              (m) The requirements of § 60.665(l) remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with § 60.665(l), provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.
              (n) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660(c)(5) must submit to the Administrator an initial report detailing the design production capacity of the process unit.
              (o) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.660(c)(6) must submit to the Administrator an initial report including a flow rate measurement using the test methods specified in § 60.664.
              (p) The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements where the owner or operator of an affected facility complies with the standards specified under § 60.662 other than as provided under § 60.663(a), (b), (c) and (d).

              (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the provisions of this subpart are applicable to the following affected facilities in fixed or portable nonmetallic mineral processing plants: each crusher, grinding mill, screening operation, bucket elevator, belt conveyor, bagging operation, storage bin, enclosed truck or railcar loading station. Also, crushers and grinding mills at hot mix asphalt facilities that reduce the size of nonmetallic minerals embedded in recycled asphalt pavement and subsequent affected facilities up to, but not including, the first storage silo or bin are subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              
              (2) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to the following operations: All facilities located in underground mines; plants without crushers or grinding mills above ground; and wet material processing operations (as defined in § 60.671).
              (b) An affected facility that is subject to the provisions of subparts F or I of this part or that follows in the plant process any facility subject to the provisions of subparts F or I of this part is not subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (c) Facilities at the following plants are not subject to the provisions of this subpart:
              (1) Fixed sand and gravel plants and crushed stone plants with capacities, as defined in § 60.671, of 23 megagrams per hour (25 tons per hour) or less;
              (2) Portable sand and gravel plants and crushed stone plants with capacities, as defined in § 60.671, of 136 megagrams per hour (150 tons per hour) or less; and
              (3) Common clay plants and pumice plants with capacities, as defined in § 60.671, of 9 megagrams per hour (10 tons per hour) or less.
              (d)(1) When an existing facility is replaced by a piece of equipment of equal or smaller size, as defined in § 60.671, having the same function as the existing facility, and there is no increase in the amount of emissions, the new facility is exempt from the provisions of §§ 60.672, 60.674, and 60.675 except as provided for in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
              (2) An owner or operator complying with paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall submit the information required in § 60.676(a).
              (3) An owner or operator replacing all existing facilities in a production line with new facilities does not qualify for the exemption described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and must comply with the provisions of §§ 60.672, 60.674 and 60.675.
              (e) An affected facility under paragraph (a) of this section that commences construction, modification, or reconstruction after August 31, 1983, is subject to the requirements of this part.
              (f) Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part 60 that do not apply to owners and operators of affected facilities subject to this subpart or that apply with certain exceptions.

              (1) A device for the continuous measurement of the pressure loss of the gas stream through the scrubber. The monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within ±250 pascals ±1 inch water gauge pressure and must be calibrated on an annual basis in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
              (2) A device for the continuous measurement of the scrubbing liquid flow rate to the wet scrubber. The monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within ±5 percent of design scrubbing liquid flow rate and must be calibrated on an annual basis in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.
              (b) The owner or operator of any affected facility for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or after April 22, 2008, that uses wet suppression to control emissions from the affected facility must perform monthly periodic inspections to check that water is flowing to discharge spray nozzles in the wet suppression system. The owner or operator must initiate corrective action within 24 hours and complete corrective action as expediently as practical if the owner or operator finds that water is not flowing properly during an inspection of the water spray nozzles. The owner or operator must record each inspection of the water spray nozzles, including the date of each inspection and any corrective actions taken, in the logbook required under § 60.676(b).
              (1) If an affected facility relies on water carryover from upstream water sprays to control fugitive emissions, then that affected facility is exempt from the 5-year repeat testing requirement specified in Table 3 of this subpart provided that the affected facility meets the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:
              (i) The owner or operator of the affected facility conducts periodic inspections of the upstream water spray(s) that are responsible for controlling fugitive emissions from the affected facility. These inspections are conducted according to paragraph (b) of this section and § 60.676(b), and
              (ii) The owner or operator of the affected facility designates which upstream water spray(s) will be periodically inspected at the time of the initial performance test required under § 60.11 of this part and § 60.675 of this subpart.

              (2) If an affected facility that routinely uses wet suppression water sprays ceases operation of the water sprays or is using a control mechanism to reduce fugitive emissions other than water sprays during the monthly inspection (for example, water from recent rainfall), the logbook entry required under § 60.676(b) must specify the control mechanism being used instead of the water sprays.
              (c) Except as specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, the owner or operator of any affected facility for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or after April 22, 2008, that uses a baghouse to control emissions must conduct quarterly 30-minute visible emissions inspections using EPA Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7). The Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) test shall be conducted while the baghouse is operating. The test is successful if no visible emissions are observed. If any visible emissions are observed, the owner or operator of the affected facility must initiate corrective action within 24 hours to return the baghouse to normal operation. The owner or operator must record each Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) test, including the date and any corrective actions taken, in the logbook required under § 60.676(b). The owner or operator of the affected facility may establish a different baghouse-specific success level for the visible emissions test (other than no visible emissions) by conducting a PM performance test according to § 60.675(b) simultaneously with a Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) to determine what constitutes normal visible emissions from that affected facility's baghouse when it is in compliance with the applicable PM concentration limit in Table 2 of this subpart. The revised visible emissions success level must be incorporated into the permit for the affected facility.
              (d) As an alternative to the periodic Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) visible emissions inspections specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of any affected facility for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or after April 22, 2008, that uses a baghouse to control emissions may use a bag leak detection system. The owner or operator must install, operate, and maintain the bag leak detection system according to paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Each bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section.
              (i) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per dry standard cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.

              (ii) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative PM loadings. The owner or operator shall continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger).
              (iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when the system detects an increase in relative particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
              (iv) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, the owner or operator must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm set points, and the alarm delay time.
              (v) Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator shall not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section.
              (vi) Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
              (vii) The owner or operator must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the fabric filter.

              (viii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
              
              (2) The owner or operator of the affected facility must develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated authority for approval of a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. The owner or operator must operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
              (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
              (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;

              (e) As an alternative to the periodic Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) visible emissions inspections specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of any affected facility that is subject to the requirements for processed stone handling operations in the Lime Manufacturing NESHAP (40 CFR part 63, subpart AAAAA) may follow the continuous compliance requirements in row 1 items (i) through (iii) of table 6 to subpart AAAAA of 40 CFR part 63.
            
            
              § 60.675
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendices A-1 through A-7 of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b). Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the PM standards in § 60.672(a) as follows:

              (1) Except as specified in paragraphs (e)(3) and (4) of this section, Method 5 of appendix A-3 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration. The sample volume shall be at least 1.70 dscm (60 dscf). For Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3), if the gas stream being sampled is at ambient temperature, the sampling probe and filter may be operated without heaters. If the gas stream is above ambient temperature, the sampling probe and filter may be operated at a temperature high enough, but no higher than 121 °C (250 °F), to prevent water condensation on the filter.
              (2) Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
              (c)(1) In determining compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.672(b) or § 60.672(e)(1), the owner or operator shall use Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11, with the following additions:
              (i) The minimum distance between the observer and the emission source shall be 4.57 meters (15 feet).

              (ii) The observer shall, when possible, select a position that minimizes interference from other fugitive emission sources (e.g., road dust). The required observer position relative to the sun (Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part, Section 2.1) must be followed.
              (iii) For affected facilities using wet dust suppression for particulate matter control, a visible mist is sometimes generated by the spray. The water mist must not be confused with particulate matter emissions and is not to be considered a visible emission. When a water mist of this nature is present, the observation of emissions is to be made at a point in the plume where the mist is no longer visible.
              (2)(i) In determining compliance with the opacity of stack emissions from any baghouse that controls emissions only from an individual enclosed storage bin under § 60.672(f) of this subpart, using Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4), the duration of the Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) observations shall be 1 hour (ten 6-minute averages).
              (ii) The duration of the Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) observations may be reduced to the duration the affected facility operates (but not less than 30 minutes) for baghouses that control storage bins or enclosed truck or railcar loading stations that operate for less than 1 hour at a time.
              (3) When determining compliance with the fugitive emissions standard for any affected facility described under § 60.672(b) or § 60.672(e)(1) of this subpart, the duration of the Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) observations must be 30 minutes (five 6-minute averages). Compliance with the applicable fugitive emission limits in Table 3 of this subpart must be based on the average of the five 6-minute averages.
              (d) To demonstrate compliance with the fugitive emission limits for buildings specified in § 60.672(e)(1), the owner or operator must complete the testing specified in paragraph (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Performance tests must be conducted while all affected facilities inside the building are operating.
              (1) If the building encloses any affected facility that commences construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after April 22, 2008, the owner or operator of the affected facility must conduct an initial Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) performance test according to this section and § 60.11.
              (2) If the building encloses only affected facilities that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction before April 22, 2008, and the owner or operator has previously conducted an initial Method 22 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7) performance test showing zero visible emissions, then the owner or operator has demonstrated compliance with the opacity limit in § 60.672(e)(1). If the owner or operator has not conducted an initial performance test for the building before April 22, 2008, then the owner or operator must conduct an initial Method 9 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4) performance test according to this section and § 60.11 to show compliance with the opacity limit in § 60.672(e)(1).
              (e) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
              (1) For the method and procedure of paragraph (c) of this section, if emissions from two or more facilities continuously interfere so that the opacity of fugitive emissions from an individual affected facility cannot be read, either of the following procedures may be used:
              (i) Use for the combined emission stream the highest fugitive opacity standard applicable to any of the individual affected facilities contributing to the emissions stream.

              (ii) Separate the emissions so that the opacity of emissions from each affected facility can be read.
              
              (2) A single visible emission observer may conduct visible emission observations for up to three fugitive, stack, or vent emission points within a 15-second interval if the following conditions are met:
              (i) No more than three emission points may be read concurrently.
              (ii) All three emission points must be within a 70 degree viewing sector or angle in front of the observer such that the proper sun position can be maintained for all three points.
              (iii) If an opacity reading for any one of the three emission points equals or exceeds the applicable standard, then the observer must stop taking readings for the other two points and continue reading just that single point.
              (3) Method 5I of appendix A-3 of this part may be used to determine the PM concentration as an alternative to the methods specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Method 5I (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3) may be useful for affected facilities that operate for less than 1 hour at a time such as (but not limited to) storage bins or enclosed truck or railcar loading stations.

              (4) In some cases, velocities of exhaust gases from building vents may be too low to measure accurately with the type S pitot tube specified in EPA Method 2 of appendix A-1 of this part [i.e., velocity head <1.3 mm H2O (0.05 in. H2O)] and referred to in EPA Method 5 of appendix A-3 of this part. For these conditions, the owner or operator may determine the average gas flow rate produced by the power fans (e.g., from vendor-supplied fan curves) to the building vent. The owner or operator may calculate the average gas velocity at the building vent measurement site using Equation 1 of this section and use this average velocity in determining and maintaining isokinetic sampling rates.

                Where:
                
                Ve = average building vent velocity (feet per minute);
                Qf = average fan flow rate (cubic feet per minute); and
                Ae = area of building vent and measurement location (square feet).
              
              
              (f) To comply with § 60.676(d), the owner or operator shall record the measurements as required in § 60.676(c) using the monitoring devices in § 60.674 (a)(1) and (2) during each particulate matter run and shall determine the averages.
              (g) For performance tests involving only Method 9 (40 CFR part 60 appendix A-4) testing, the owner or operator may reduce the 30-day advance notification of performance test in § 60.7(a)(6) and 60.8(d) to a 7-day advance notification.
              (h) [Reserved]
              (i) If the initial performance test date for an affected facility falls during a seasonal shut down (as defined in § 60.671 of this subpart) of the affected facility, then with approval from the permitting authority, the owner or operator may postpone the initial performance test until no later than 60 calendar days after resuming operation of the affected facility.
            
            
              § 60.676

              § 60.680
              Applicability and designation of affected facility.
              (a) The affected facility to which the provisions of this subpart apply is each rotary spin wool fiberglass insulation manufacturing line.
              (b) The owner or operator of any facility under paragraph (a) of this section that commences construction, modification, or reconstruction after February 7, 1984, is subject to the requirements of this subpart.
            
            
              § 60.681
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.
              
                Glass pull rate means the mass of molten glass utilized in the manufacture of wool fiberglass insulation at a single manufacturing line in a specified time period.
              
                Manufacturing line means the manufacturing equipment comprising the forming section, where molten glass is fiberized and a fiberglass mat is formed; the curing section, where the binder resin in the mat is thermally “set;” and the cooling section, where the mat is cooled.
              
                Rotary spin means a process used to produce wool fiberglass insulation by forcing molten glass through numerous small orifices in the side wall of a spinner to form continuous glass fibers that are then broken into discrete lengths by high velocity air flow.
              
                Wool fiberglass insulation means a thermal insulation material composed of glass fibers and made from glass produced or melted at the same facility where the manufacturing line is located.
            
            
              § 60.682
              Standard for particulate matter.
              On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any affected facility any gases which contain particulate matter in excess of 5.5 kg/Mg (11.0 1b/ton) of glass pulled.
            
            
              § 60.683
              Monitoring of operations.
              (a) An owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart who uses a wet scrubbing control device to comply with the mass emission standard shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices that measure the gas pressure drop across each scrubber and the scrubbing liquid flow rate to each scrubber. The pressure drop monitor is to be certified by its manufacturer to be accurate within ±250 pascals (±1 inch water gauge) over its operating range, and the flow rate monitor is to be certified by its manufacturer to be accurate within ±5 percent over its operating range.

              (b) An owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart who uses a wet electrostatic precipitator control device to comply with the mass emission standard shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices that measure the primary and secondary current (amperes) and voltage in each electrical field and the inlet water flow rate. In addition, the owner or operator shall determine the total residue (total solids) content of the water entering the control device once per day using Method 209A, “Total Residue Dried at 103-105 °C,” in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 15th Edition, 1980 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17). Total residue shall be reported as percent by weight. All monitoring devices required under this paragraph are to be certified by their manufacturers to be accurate within ±5 percent over their operating range.
              (c) All monitoring devices required under this section are to be recalibrated quarterly in accordance with procedures under § 60.13(b).
            
            
              § 60.684
              Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
              (a) At 30-minute intervals during each 2-hour test run of each performance test of a wet scrubber control device and at least once every 4 hours thereafter, the owner or operator shall record the measurements required by § 60.683(a).
              (b) At 30-minute intervals during each 2-hour test run of each performance test of a wet electrostatic precipitator control device and at least once every 4 hours thereafter, the owner or operator shall record the measurements required by § 60.683(b), except that the concentration of total residue in the water shall be recorded once during each performance test and once per day thereafter.
              (c) Records of the measurements required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be retained for at least 2 years.
              (d) Each owner or operator shall submit written semiannual reports of exceedances of control device operating parameters required to be monitored by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and written documentation of, and a report of corrective maintenance required as a result of, quarterly calibrations of the monitoring devices required in § 60.683(c). For the purpose of these reports, exceedances are defined as any monitoring data that are less than 70 percent of the lowest value or greater than 130 percent of the highest value of each operating parameter recorded during the most recent performance test.

              (e) The requirements of this section remain in force until and unless the Agency, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected facilities within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this section, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.

                K′ = conversion factor, 6 × 10−5 (min-Mg)/(hr-g) [3 × 10−2 (min-ton)/(hr-lb)].
              
              
              (i) ASTM D2584-68 (Reapproved 1985) or 94 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17), shall be used to determine the LOI for each run.
              (ii) Line speed (Ls), trimmed mat width (Wm), and mat gram weight (M) shall be determined for each run from the process information or from direct measurements.
              (d) To comply with § 60.684(d), the owner or operator shall record measurements as required in § 60.684 (a) and (b) using the monitoring devices in § 60.683 (a) and (b) during the particulate matter runs.

              Permission to use alternative means of emission limitation.

              (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in VOC emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in VOC emissions achieved by the applicable requirement in § 60.692, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement. The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
              (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be published only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
              (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that the alternative means achieves equivalent emission reductions.
            
            
              § 60.695
              Monitoring of operations.
              (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's specifications the following equipment, unless alternative monitoring procedures or requirements are approved for that facility by the Administrator.
              (1) Where a thermal incinerator is used for VOC emission reduction, a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder shall be used to measure the temperature of the gas stream in the combustion zone of the incinerator. The temperature monitoring device shall have an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being measured, expressed in °C, or ±0.5 °C (0.9 °F), whichever is greater.
              (2) Where a catalytic incinerator is used for VOC emission reduction, temperature monitoring devices, each equipped with a continuous recorder shall be used to measure the temperature in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed of the incinerator. The temperature monitoring devices shall have an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being measured, expressed in °C, or ±0.5 °C (0.9 °F), whichever is greater.
              (3) Where a carbon adsorber is used for VOC emissions reduction, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the VOC concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases of the control device outlet gas stream or inlet and outlet gas stream shall be used.
              (i) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed directly onsite, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the volatile organic compound concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases of the control device outlet gas stream or inlet and outlet gas stream shall be used.

              (ii) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device (e.g., a carbon canister), the concentration level of the organic compounds in the exhaust vent stream from the carbon adsorption system shall be monitored on a regular schedule, and the existing carbon shall be replaced with fresh carbon immediately when carbon breakthrough is indicated. The device shall be monitored on a daily basis or at intervals no greater than 20 percent of the design carbon replacement interval, whichever is greater. As an alternative to conducting this monitoring, an owner or operator may replace the carbon in the carbon adsorption system with fresh carbon at a regular predetermined time interval that is less than the carbon replacement interval that is determined by the maximum design flow rate and organic concentration in the gas stream vented to the carbon adsorption system.
              (4) Where a flare is used for VOC emission reduction, the owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 60.18(f)(2).
              (b) Where a VOC recovery device other than a carbon adsorber is used to meet the requirements specified in § 60.692-5(a), the owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator information describing the operation of the control device and the process parameter(s) that would indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device. The Administrator may request further information and will specify appropriate monitoring procedures or requirements.
              (c) An alternative operational or process parameter may be monitored if it can be demonstrated that another parameter will ensure that the control device is operated in conformance with these standards and the control device's design specifications.

              (a) Before using any equipment installed in compliance with the requirements of § 60.692-2, § 60.692-3, § 60.692-4, § 60.692-5, or § 60.693, the owner or operator shall inspect such equipment for indications of potential emissions, defects, or other problems that may cause the requirements of this subpart not to be met. Points of inspection shall include, but are not limited to, seals, flanges, joints, gaskets, hatches, caps, and plugs.
              (b) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a closed vent system and control device as required in § 60.692-5 (other than a flare) is exempt from § 60.8 of the General Provisions and shall use Method 21 to measure the emission concentrations, using 500 ppm as the no detectable emission limit. The instrument shall be calibrated each day before using. The calibration gases shall be:
              (1) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air), and
              (2) A mixture of either methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane.

              (d) After installing the control equipment required to meet § 60.693-2(a) or whenever sources that have ceased to treat refinery wastewater for a period of 1 year or more are placed back into service, the owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standards in § 60.693-2(a) as follows:
              (1) The maximum gap widths and maximum gap areas between the primary seal and the separator wall and between the secondary seal and the separator wall shall be determined individually within 60 calendar days of the initial installation of the floating roof and introduction of refinery wastewater or 60 calendar days after the equipment is placed back into service using the following procedure when the separator is filled to the design operating level and when the roof is floating off the roof supports.
              (i) Measure seal gaps around the entire perimeter of the separator in each place where a 0.32 cm (0.125 in.) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and the wall of the separator and measure the gap width and perimetrical distance of each such location.
              (ii) The total surface area of each gap described in (d)(1)(i) of this section shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective perimetrical distance.

              (iii) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually, divide the sum for each seal by the nominal perimeter of the separator basin and compare each to the maximum gap area as specified in § 60.693-2.
              (2) The gap widths and total gap area shall be determined using the procedure in paragraph (d)(1) of this section according to the following frequency:
              (i) For primary seals, once every 5 years.
              (ii) For secondary seals, once every year.

                (Note:
                The intent of these standards is to minimize emissions of VOC through the application of best demonstrated technology (BDT). The numerical emission limits in these standards are expressed in terms of TOC, measured as TOC less methane and ethane. This emission limit reflects the performance of BDT.)

              As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of part 60, and the following terms shall have the specific meanings given them.
              
                Batch operation means any noncontinuous reactor process that is not characterized by steady-state conditions and in which reactants are not added and products are not removed simultaneously.
              
                Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator.
              
              
                By compound means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.
              
                Car-seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to change the position of a valve (e.g., from opened to closed) in such a way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal.
              
                Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as an incinerator, flare, boiler, or process heater, used for combustion of a vent stream discharged from the process vent.
              
                Continuous recorder means a data recording device recording an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.
              
                Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler occupied by the flame envelope.
              
                Flow indicator means a device which indicates whether gas flow is present in a line.
              
                Halogenated vent stream means any vent stream determined to have a total concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens of 20 ppmv (by compound) or greater.
              
                Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds. If there is energy recovery, the energy recovery section and the combustion chambers are not of integral design. That is, the energy recovery section and the combustion section are not physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit but are joined by ducts or connections carrying flue gas.
              
                Primary fuel means the fuel fired through a burner or a number of similar burners. The primary fuel provides the principal heat input to the device, and the amount of fuel is sufficient to sustain operation without the addition of other fuels.

                Recovery system means an individual recovery device or series of such devices applied to the same vent stream.
              
                Relief valve means a valve used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge results from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
              
                Secondary fuel means a fuel fired through a burner other than a primary fuel burner. The secondary fuel may provide supplementary heat in addition to the heat provided by the primary fuel.

For the purposes of measuring molar composition as required in § 60.704(d)(2)(i) and § 60.704(d)(2)(ii), hourly emission rate as required in § 60.704(d)(5) and § 60.704(e), and TOC concentration as required in § 60.705(b)(4) and § 60.705(f)(4), those compounds which the Administrator has determined do not contribute appreciably to the formation of ozone are to be excluded.
              
                Total resource effectiveness or TRE index value means a measure of the supplemental total resource requirement per unit reduction of TOC associated with a vent stream from an affected reactor process facility, based on vent stream flow rate, emission rate of TOC, net heating value, and corrosion properties (whether or not the vent stream contains halogenated compounds), as quantified by the equation given under § 60.704(e).
              
                Vent stream means any gas stream discharged directly from a reactor process to the atmosphere or indirectly to the atmosphere after diversion through other process equipment. The vent stream excludes relief valve discharges and equipment leaks.
            
            
              § 60.702
              Standards.

                er31au93.010
              
              
                where:
                
                HT = Net heating value of the sample, MJ/scm, where the net enthalpy per mole of vent stream is based on combustion at ­25 °C and 760 mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 °C, as in the definition of Qs (vent stream flow rate).
                K1 = Constant, 1.740 × 10−7 (l/ppm) (g-mole/scm) (MJ/kcal), where standard temperature for (g-mole/scm) is 20 °C.
                Cj = Concentration on a dry basis of compound j in ppm, as measured for organics by Method 18 and measured for hydrogen and carbon monoxide by ASTM D1946-77 or 90 (Reapproved 1994) (incorporation by reference as specified in § 60.17 of this part) as indicated in § 60.704(d)(2).
                Hj = Net heat of combustion of compound j, kcal/g-mole, based on combustion at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg. The heats of combustion of vent stream components would be required to be determined using ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporation by reference as specified in § 60.17 of this part) if published values are not available or cannot be calculated.
                Bws = Water vapor content of the vent stream, proportion by volume.
              
              
              (5) The emission rate of TOC in the vent stream shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                er31au93.011
              
              
                where:
                
                ETOC = Emission rate of TOC in the sample, kg/hr.
                K2 = Constant, 2.494 × 10−6 (l/ppm) (g-mole/scm) (kg/g) (min/hr), where standard temperature for (g-mole/scm) is 20 °C.
                Cj = Concentration on a dry basis of compound j in ppm as measured by Method 18 as indicated in § 60.704(d)(2).
                Mj = Molecular weight of sample j, g/g-mole.
                Qs = Vent stream flow rate (dscm/min) at a temperature of 20 °C.
              
              
              (6) The total vent stream concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens (ppmv, by compound) shall be summed from the individual concentrations of compounds containing halogens which were measured by Method 18.
              (e) For purposes of complying with §§ 60.700(c)(2) and 60.702(c), the owner or operator of a facility affected by this subpart shall calculate the TRE index value of the vent stream using the equation for incineration in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for halogenated vent streams. The owner or operator of an affected facility with a nonhalogenated vent stream shall determine the TRE index value by calculating values using both the incinerator equation in (e)(1) of this section and the flare equation in (e)(2) of this section and selecting the lower of the two values.
              (1) The equation for calculating the TRE index value of a vent stream controlled by an incinerator is as follows:
              
                ER27NO95.000
              

              (i) Where for a vent stream flow rate (scm/min) at a standard temperature of 20 °C that is greater than or equal to 14.2 scm/min:
              
              
                TRE = TRE index value.
                Qs = Vent stream flow rate (scm/min) at a standard temperature of 20 °C.
                HT = Vent stream net heating value (MJ/scm), where the net enthalpy per mole of vent stream is based on combustion at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 °C as in the definition of Qs.
                Ys = Qs for all vent stream categories listed in table 1 except for Category E vent streams where Ys = (Qs)(HT)/3.6.
                ETOC = Hourly emissions of TOC reported in kg/hr.
              
              
              a, b, c, d, e, and f are coefficients. The set of coefficients that apply to a vent stream can be obtained from table 1.

              Qs = 14.2 scm/min.
              HT = (FLOW)(HVAL)/14.2
              
              
                where the following inputs are used:
                
                FLOW = Vent stream flow rate (scm/min), at a standard temperature of 20 °C.

                HVAL = Vent stream net heating value (MJ/scm), where the net enthalpy per mole of vent stream is based on combustion at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 °C as in definition of Qs.
                Ys = 14.2 scm/min for all vent streams except for Category E vent streams, where Ys = (14.2)(HT)/3.6.
                
                ETOC = Hourly emissions of TOC reported in kg/hr.
              
              a, b, c, d, e, and f are coefficients. The set of coefficients that apply to a vent stream can be obtained from table 1.
              (2) The equation for calculating the TRE index value of a vent stream controlled by a flare is as follows:

                where:
                
                TRE = TRE index value.
                ETOC = Hourly emission rate of TOC reported in kg/hr.
                Qs = Vent stream flow rate (scm/min) at a standard temperature of 20 °C.
                HT = Vent stream net heating value (MJ/scm) where the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 °C as in the definition of Qs.
              
              
              a, b, c, d, and e are coefficients. The set of coefficients that apply to a vent stream can be obtained from table 2.

              (f) Each owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to comply with § 60.700(c)(2) or § 60.702(c) shall recalculate the TRE index value for that affected facility whenever process changes are made. Examples of process changes include changes in production capacity, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. The TRE index value shall be recalculated based on test data, or on best engineering estimates of the effects of the change on the recovery system.
              (1) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 1.0, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 1 week of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to the methods and procedures required by § 60.704 in order to determine compliance with § 60.702 (a) or (b). Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
              (2) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 8.0 but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test in accordance with §§ 60.8 and 60.704 and shall comply with §§ 60.703, 60.704 and 60.705. Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
              (g) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.700(c)(4) shall use Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for determination of volumetric flow rate.
              (h) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate that a reactor process vent stream has a TOC concentration for compliance with the low concentration exemption in § 60.700(c)(8) shall conduct an initial test to measure TOC concentration.

              (1) The sampling site shall be selected as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.
              
              (2) Method 18 or Method 25A of part 60, appendix A shall be used to measure concentration.
              (3) Where Method 18 is used to qualify for the low concentration exclusion in § 60.700(c)(8), the procedures in § 60.704(b)(4) (i) and (iv) shall be used to measure TOC concentration, and the procedures of § 60.704(b)(3) shall be used to correct the TOC concentration to 3 percent oxygen. To qualify for the exclusion, the results must demonstrate that the concentration of TOC, corrected to 3 percent oxygen, is below 300 ppm by volume.
              (4) Where Method 25A is used, the following procedures shall be used to calculate ppm by volume TOC concentration, corrected to 3 percent oxygen:
              (i) Method 25A shall be used only if a single organic compound is greater than 50 percent of total TOC, by volume, in the reactor process vent stream. This compound shall be the principal organic compound.
              (ii) The principal organic compound may be determined by either process knowledge or test data collected using an appropriate EPA Reference Method. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances, process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current reactor process vent stream conditions.
              (iii) The principal organic compound shall be used as the calibration gas for Method 25A.
              (iv) The span value for Method 25A shall be 300 ppmv.
              (v) Use of Method 25A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
              (vi) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the concentration of TOC including methane and ethane measured by Method 25A, corrected to 3 percent oxygen, is below 150 ppm by volume to qualify for the low concentration exclusion in § 60.700(c)(8).
              (vii) The concentration of TOC shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen using the procedures and equation in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

              (4) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.702(c):
              (i) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the exit specific gravity (or alternative parameter which is a measure of the degree of absorbing liquid saturation, if approved by the Administrator), and average exit temperature, of the absorbing liquid measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing (both measured while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted); or
              (ii) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the average exit (product side) temperature measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally; or
              (iii) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system, the total steam mass flow measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance test (full carbon bed cycle), temperature of the carbon bed after regeneration [and within 15 minutes of completion of any cooling cycle(s)], and duration of the carbon bed steaming cycle (all measured while the vent stream is routed and constituted normally); or
              (iv) As an alternative to § 60.705(b)(4) (i), (ii) or (iii), the concentration level or reading indicated by the organics monitoring device at the outlet of the absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber, measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the same time period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.
              (v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE index value of the vent stream.
              (c) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under § 60.703 (a) and (c) as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where a combustion device is used to comply with § 60.702(a), periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:

              (1) For thermal incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance with § 60.702(a) was determined.

              (3) All periods recorded under § 60.705(f) in which the pilot flame of the flare was absent.

              (4) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the operating vent stream flow rate above the low flow exemption level in § 60.700(c)(4), including a measurement of the new vent stream flow rate, as recorded under § 60.705(i). These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed within the same time period to verify the recalculated flow value and to obtain the vent stream characteristics of heating value and ETOC. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8 of the General Provisions. Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under any of the exemption provisions listed in § 60.700(c), except for the total resource effectiveness index greater than 8.0 exemption in § 60.700(c)(2), the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.702.

              (5) Any change in equipment or process operation, as recorded under paragraph (i) of this section, that increases the design production capacity above the low capacity exemption level in § 60.700(c)(3) and the new capacity resulting from the change for the reactor process unit containing the affected facility. These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be completed within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow rate, heating value, and ETOC. The performance test is subject to the requirements of § 60.8. The facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.702 or § 60.700(d).

Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under any of the exemption provisions listed in § 60.700(c), except for the TRE index greater than 8.0 exemption in § 60.700(c)(2), the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in § 60.702.
              (m) The requirements of § 60.705(l) remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with § 60.705(l), provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.
              (n) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with § 60.700(c)(3) must submit to the Administrator an initial report detailing the design production capacity of the process unit.

              § 60.710
              Applicability and designation of affected facility.
              (a) The affected facilities to which the provisions of this subpart apply are:
              (1) Each coating operation; and
              (2) Each piece of coating mix preparation equipment.
              (b) Any new coating operation that utilizes less than 38 m3 of solvent or any modified or reconstructed coating operation that utilizes less than 370 m3 of solvent for the manufacture of magnetic tape per calendar year is subject only to the requirements of §§ 60.714(a), 60.717(b), and 60.717(c). If the amount of solvent utilized for the manufacture of magnetic tape equals or exceeds these amounts in any calendar year, the facility is subject to § 60.712 and all other sections of this subpart. Once a facility has become subject to § 60.712 and all other sections of this subpart, it will remain subject to those requirements regardless of changes in annual solvent utilization.
              (c) This subpart applies to any affected facility for which construction, modification, or reconstruction begins after January 22, 1986.
            
            
              § 60.711
              Definitions, symbols, and cross reference tables.
              (a) All terms used in this subpart that are not defined below have the meaning given to them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.
              (1) Base film means the substrate that is coated to produce magnetic tape.
              (2) Capture system means any device or combination of devices that contains or collects an airborne pollutant and directs it into a duct.
              (3) Coating applicator means any apparatus used to apply a coating to a continuous base film.
              (4) Coating mix preparation equipment means all mills, mixers, holding tanks, polishing tanks, and other equipment used in the preparation of the magnetic coating formulation but does not include those mills that do not emit VOC because they are closed, sealed, and operated under pressure.
              (5) Coating operation means any coating applicator, flashoff area, and drying oven located between a base film unwind station and a base film rewind station that coat a continuous base film to produce magnetic tape.
              (6) Common emission control device means a control device controlling emissions from the coating operation as well as from another emission source within the plant.
              (7) Concurrent means construction of a control device is commenced or completed within the period beginning 6 months prior to the date construction of affected coating mix preparation equipment commences and ending 2 years after the date construction of affected coating mix preparation equipment is completed.
              (8) Control device means any apparatus that reduces the quantity of a pollutant emitted to the air.
              (9) Cover means, with respect to coating mix preparation equipment, a device that lies over the equipment opening to prevent VOC from escaping and that meets the requirements found in § 60.712(c)(1)-(5).
              (10) Drying oven means a chamber in which heat is used to bake, cure, polymerize, or dry a surface coating.
              (11) Equivalent diameter means four times the area of an opening divided by its perimeter.
              (12) Flashoff area means the portion of a coating operation between the coating applicator and the drying oven where solvent begins to evaporate from the coated base film.
              (13) Magnetic tape means any flexible substrate that is covered on one or both sides with a coating containing magnetic particles and that is used for audio or video recording or information storage.
              (14) Natural draft opening means any opening in a room, building, or total enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and that is not connected to a duct in which a fan is installed. The rate and direction of the natural draft across such an opening is a consequence of the difference in pressures on either side of the wall containing the opening.
              (15) Nominal 1-month period means a calendar month or, if established prior to the performance test in a statement submitted with notification of anticipated startup pursuant to 40 CFR 60.7(a)(2), a similar monthly time period (e.g., 30-day month or accounting month).
              (16) Temporary enclosure means a total enclosure that is constructed for the sole purpose of measuring the fugitive emissions from an affected facility. A temporary enclosure must be constructed and ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal impact on the performance of the permanent capture system. A temporary enclosure will be assumed to achieve total capture of fugitive VOC emissions if it conforms to the requirements found in § 60.713(b)(5)(i) and if all natural draft openings are at least four duct or hood equivalent diameters away from each exhaust duct or hood. Alternatively, the owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for approval of a temporary enclosure on a case-by-case basis.
              (17) Total enclosure means a structure that is constructed around a source of emissions so that all VOC emissions are collected and exhausted through a stack or duct. With a total enclosure, there will be no fugitive emissions, only stack emissions. The only openings in a total enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural draft openings such as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit the enclosure for processing. All access doors or windows are closed during routine operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional openings of such doors or windows to accommodate process equipment adjustments are acceptable, but, if such openings are routine or if an access door remains open during the entire operation, the access door must be considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face velocity across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be calculated including the area of such access doors. The drying oven itself may be part of the total enclosure. A permanent enclosure that meets the requirements found in § 60.713(b)(5)(i) is assumed to be a total enclosure. The owner or operator of a permanent enclosure that does not meet the requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. Such approval shall be granted upon a demonstration to the satisfaction of the Administrator that all VOC emissions are contained and vented to the control device.
              (18) Utilize refers to the use of solvent that is delivered to coating mix preparation equipment for the purpose of formulating coatings to be applied on an affected coating operation and any other solvent (e.g., dilution solvent) that is added at any point in the manufacturing process.
              (19) VOC content of the coating applied means the product of Method 24 VOC analyses or formulation data (if the data are demonstrated to be equivalent to Method 24 results) and the total volume of coating fed to the coating applicator. This quantity is intended to include all VOC that actually are emitted from the coating operation in the gaseous phase. Thus, for purposes of the liquid-liquid VOC material balance in § 60.713(b)(1), any VOC (including dilution solvent) added to the coatings must be accounted for, and any VOC contained in waste coatings or retained in the final product may be measured and subtracted from the total. (These adjustments are not necessary for the gaseous emission test compliance provisions of § 60.713(b).)
              (20) Volatile Organic Compounds or VOC means any organic compounds that participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions or that are measured by Method 18, 24, 25, or 25A or an equivalent or alternative method as defined in 40 CFR 60.2.

                  b Refer to part B to determine which subsections of §§ 60.714, 60.715, and 60.717 correspond to each compliance provision (§ 60.713).
                
                  c As per § 60.710(b), any new coating operation with solvent utilization <38 m3/yr or any modified or reconstructed coating operation with solvent utilization <370 m3/yr is exempt from the VOC standards (§ 60.712). Such coating operations are subject only to §§ 60.714(a), 60.717(b), and 60.717(c). However, should a coating operation once exceed the applicable annual solvent utilization cutoff, that coating operation shall be subject to the VOC standards (§ 60.712) and all other sections of the subpart. Once this has occurred, the coating operation shall remain subject to those requirements regardless of changes in annual solvent utilization.
                
                  d As applicable.
                
                  e Section 60.716 permits the use of an alternative means of VOC emission limitation that achieves an equivalent or greater VOC emission reduction.

              § 60.712
              Standards for volatile organic compounds.
              Each owner or operator of any affected facility that is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with the emission limitations set forth in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated or 180 days after initial startup, whichever date comes first.
              (a) Each owner or operator shall control emissions from a new coating operation by recovering or destroying at least 93 percent of the VOC content of the coating applied at the coating applicator.

              (ii) If the VOC control device in use during the control device efficiency demonstration made pursuant to § 60.713(a)(2) is subsequently replaced, each owner or operator shall install a VOC control device that is at least 95 percent efficient and ventilate all VOC emissions from the total enclosure to the control device.
              (3) For coating operations not subject to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, each owner or operator shall control emissions from the coating operation by recovering or destroying at least 93 percent of the VOC content of the coating applied at the coating applicator.

An opening sufficient to allow safe clearance for a mixer shaft is acceptable during those periods when the shaft is in place; and

              (5) A polyethylene or nonpermanent cover may be used provided it meets the requirements of (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this section. Such a cover shall not be reused after once being removed.
              (d) Each owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment not subject to § 60.712(c) shall control emissions from the coating mix preparation equipment by either:

              § 60.713
              Compliance provisions.
              (a) Applicability of § 60.712(b)(1) and (2) (standards for modified or reconstructed coating operations) and determination of control level required in § 60.712(b)(1)(ii)(B).
              (1) To establish applicability of § 60.712(b)(1), each owner or operator must demonstrate, prior to modification or reconstruction, that at least 90 percent of the VOC content of the coating applied at the coating applicator is recovered or destroyed. Such demonstration shall be made using the procedures of paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section, as appropriate.
              (2) To establish applicability of § 60.712(b)(2), each owner or operator must demonstrate, prior to modification or reconstruction, that a total enclosure is installed around the existing coating operation and that all VOC emissions are ventilated to a control device that is at least 92 percent efficient.

              (3) To determine the level of control required in § 60.712(b)(1)(ii)(B), the owner or operator must demonstrate:
              (i) That the VOC control device subsequently installed is at least 95 percent efficient. Such demonstration shall be made using Equation (2) specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section or Equations (4) and (5) specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section, as applicable, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 60.715(b)-(g); and
              (ii) That the overall level of control after the VOC control device is installed is at least as high as the level demonstrated prior to modification or reconstruction pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such demonstrations shall be made using the procedures of paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section, as appropriate. The required overall level of control subsequent to this demonstration shall be the level so demonstrated or 93 percent, whichever is lower.
              (b) Compliance demonstrations for § 60.712(a), (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (c), (d), and (e).
              (1) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.712(a), (b)(1), or (b)(3) (standards for coating operations) when emissions from only the affected coating operations are controlled by a dedicated solvent recovery device, each owner or operator of the affected coating operation shall perform a liquid-liquid VOC material balance over each and every nominal 1-month period. When demonstrating compliance by this procedure, § 60.8(f) of the General Provisions does not apply. The amount of liquid VOC applied and recovered shall be determined as discussed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. The overall VOC emission reduction (R) is calculated using the following equation:

              (E) Calculate the overall VOC emission reduction (R) for each and every nominal 1-month period using Equation 1.
              (iv) For facilities subject to § 60.712 (a) or (b)(3), compliance is demonstrated if the value of R is equal to or greater than 93 percent.
              (v) Subject to the provisions of (b)(1)(vi) of this section, for facilities subject to § 60.712(b)(1), compliance is demonstrated if the value of R is equal to or greater than the percent reduction demonstrated pursuant to § 60.713(a)(1) prior to modification or reconstruction or 93 percent whichever is lower.
              (vi) For facilities subject to § 60.712(b)(1)(ii), compliance is demonstrated if the value of E (control device efficiency) is greater than or equal to 0.95 and if the value of R is equal to or greater than the percent reduction demonstrated pursuant to § 60.713(a)(3) or 93 percent, whichever is lower.
              (2) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.712(a), (b)(1), or (b)(3) (standards for coating operations) when the emissions from only an affected coating operation are controlled by a dedicated incinerator or when a common emission control device (other than a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel) is used to control emissions from an affected coating operation as well as from other sources of VOC, each owner or operator of an affected coating operation shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures:
              (i) Construct the overall VOC emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 60.715(b) through (g);
              (ii) Determine capture efficiency from the coating operation by capturing, venting, and measuring all VOC emissions from the operation.

              (A) Build a temporary enclosure (see § 60.711(a)(16)) around the affected coating operation; or
              (B) Shut down all other sources of VOC and continue to exhaust fugitive emissions from the affected coating operation through any building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as drying ovens. All ventilation air must be vented through stacks suitable for testing;
              (iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources connected and operating;

              (v) Determine the efficiency (F) of the VOC capture system using the following equation:
              
                
                EC01JN92.059
              
              (vi) For each affected coating operation subject to § 60.712(a) or (b)(3), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (E) × (F) is equal to or greater than 0.93.
              (vii) For each affected coating operation subject to § 60.712(b)(1)(i), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (E) × (F) is equal to or greater than the fractional reduction demonstrated pursuant to § 60.713(a)(1) prior to modification or reconstruction or 0.93, whichever is lower.
              (viii) For each affected coating operation subject to § 60.712(b)(1)(ii), compliance is demonstrated if the value of E is greater than or equal to 0.95 and if the product of (E) × (F) is equal to or greater than the fractional reduction demonstrated pursuant to § 60.713(a)(3) or 0.93, whichever is lower.
              (3) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.712(a), (b)(1), or (b)(3) (standards for coating operations) when a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel is used to control emissions from an affected coating operation as well as from other sources of VOC, each owner or operator of an affected coating operation shall perform a gaseous emission test using the following procedures:
              (i) Construct the overall VOC emission reduction system so that each volumetric flow rate and the total VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 60.715(b) through (g);
              (ii) Assure that all VOC emissions from the coating operation are segregated from other VOC sources and that the emissions can be captured for measurement, as described in § 60.713(b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B);
              (iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources connected and operating;
              (iv) Determine the efficiency (Hv) of each individual adsorber vessel (v) using the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.060
              

              (v) Determine the efficiency of the carbon adsorption system (Hsys) by computing the average efficiency of the adsorber vessels as weighted by the volumetric flow rate (Qhv) of each individual adsorber vessel (v) using the following equation:

              (4) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.712(a), (b)(1), or (b)(3) (standards for coating operations) when the VOC emissions from more than one affected coating operation are collected by a common capture system and are vented through a common duct to a control device that is also controlling emissions from nonaffected sources and the emissions from the nonaffected sources are vented separately from the affected coating operations, the owner or operator may:
              (i) Consider the combined affected coating operations as a single emission source; and
              (ii) Conduct a compliance test on this single source by the methods described in § 60.713(b)(2) or (3), as applicable.
              (5) An alternative method of demonstrating compliance with § 60.712(a) or (b)(3) (standards for coating operations) and the sole method of demonstrating compliance with § 60.712(b)(2) (standards for modified or reconstructed coating operations) is the installation of a total enclosure around the coating operation and the ventilation of all VOC emissions from the total enclosure to a control device with the efficiency specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable. If this method is selected, the compliance test methods described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section are not required. Instead, each owner or operator of an affected coating operation shall:
              (i) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. An enclosure that meets the requirements in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of this section shall be assumed to be a total enclosure. The owner or operator of an enclosed coating operation that does not meet the requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. The enclosure shall be considered a total enclosure if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that all VOC emissions from the affected coating operation are contained and vented to the control device. The requirements for automatic approval are as follows:
              (A) Total area of all natural draft openings shall not exceed 5 percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, and ceiling;
              (B) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft opening;
              (C) Average inward face velocity across all natural draft openings (FV) shall be a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the following procedures:
              (1) Construct all forced makeup air ducts and all exhaust ducts so that the volumetric flow rate in each can be accurately determined by the test methods and procedures specified in § 60.715(c) and (d). Volumetric flow rates shall be calculated without the adjustment normally made for moisture content; and
              (2) Determine FV by the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.062
              
              (D) The air passing through all natural draft openings shall flow into the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 meters per hour, the continuous inward flow of air shall be verified by continuous observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or other means approved by the Administrator over the period that the volumetric flow rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If FV is greater than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow through the natural draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all times without verification.
              (ii) Determine the control device efficiency using Equation (2) or Equations (4) and (5), as applicable, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 60.715(b) through (g).

              (iii) Compliance is demonstrated if the installation of a total enclosure is demonstrated and the value of E determined from Equation (2) (or the value of Hsys determined from Equations (4) and (5), as applicable) is equal to or greater than the required efficiency as specified below:

              Installation of monitoring devices and recordkeeping.
              All monitoring devices required under the provisions of this section shall be installed and calibrated, according to the manufacturer's specifications, prior to the initial performance tests in locations such that representative values of the monitored parameters will be obtained. The parameters to be monitored shall be continuously measured and recorded during all performance tests.
              (a) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation that utilizes less solvent annually than the applicable cutoff provided in § 60.710(b) and that is not subject to § 60.712 (standards for coating operations) shall maintain records of actual solvent use.
              (b) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation demonstrating compliance by the test method described in § 60.713(b)(1) (liquid material balance) shall maintain records of all the following for each and every nominal 1-month period:

              (3) Amount VOC recovered; and
              (4) Calculation of the percent VOC recovered.
              (c) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation or affected coating mix preparation equipment controlled by a carbon adsorption system and demonstrating compliance by the procedures described in § 60.713(b)(2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) (which include control device efficiency determinations) shall carry out the monitoring and recordkeeping provisions of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate.
              (1) For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the concentration level of organic compounds in either the control device outlet gas stream or in both the control device inlet and outlet gas streams. The outlet gas stream would be monitored if the percent increase in the concentration level of organic compounds is used as the basis for reporting, as described in § 60.717(d)(3).

This plan shall identify the parameter to be monitored as an indicator of VOC capture system performance (e.g., the amperage to the exhaust fans or duct flow rates) and the method for monitoring the chosen parameter. The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the value of the chosen parameter.
              (h) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation who uses the equipment alternative described in § 60.713(b)(5) to demonstrate compliance shall follow the procedures described in paragraph (g) of this section to establish a monitoring plan for the total enclosure.

              § 60.715
              Test methods and procedures.
              Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance as follows:
              (a) Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that plant coating formulation data are equivalent to Method 24 results, formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24 test and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24 test will govern. For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample taken into a 1-liter container at a location and time such that the sample will be representative of the coating applied to the base film (i.e., the sample shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added during the manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed immediately after the sample is taken. Any solvent or other VOC added after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the calculations that use Method 24 results.

              (b) Method 18, 25, or 25A, as appropriate to the conditions at the site, is used to determine VOC concentration. The owner or operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with the notification of the performance test required under § 60.8(d) of the General Provisions. Method selection shall be based on consideration of the diversity of organic species present and their total concentration and on consideration of the potential presence of interfering gases. Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.
              (1) When the method is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels pursuant to § 60.713(b)(2), (4), (5), or (6), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.
              (2) When the method is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel pursuant to § 60.713(b)(3), (4), (5), or (6), each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The test for each adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.
              (c) Method 1 or 1A is used for sample and velocity traverses.
              (d) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D is used for velocity and volumetric flow rates.
              (e) Method 3 is used for gas analysis.
              (f) Method 4 is used for stack gas moisture.
              (g) Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 shall be performed, as applicable, at least twice during each test period.

              § 60.716
              Permission to use alternative means of emission limitation.

              (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of VOC from any emission point subject to § 60.712(c) or (d) (standards for mix equipment) at least equivalent to that required by § 60.712 (c) or (d), respectively, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means. The notice may condition permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
              (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.
              (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit either results from an emission test that documents the collection and measurement of all VOC emissions from a given control device or an engineering evaluation that documents the determination of such emissions.

In addition, the average values of the monitored parameters measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the period of the performance test shall be submitted with the results of all performance tests.
              (b) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation claiming to utilize less than the applicable volume of solvent specified in § 60.710(b) in the first calendar year of operation shall submit to the Administrator, with the notification of projected startup, a material flow chart indicating projected solvent use. The owner or operator shall also submit actual solvent use records at the end of the initial calendar year.
              (c) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation initially utilizing less than the applicable volume of solvent specified in § 60.710(b) per calendar year shall report the first calendar year in which actual annual solvent use exceeds the applicable volume.

              (d) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation, or affected coating mix preparation equipment subject to § 60.712(c), shall submit semiannual reports to the Administrator documenting the following:

              (a) Section 60.8 (d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test procedures required by this section.
              (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8(a) and thereafter a performance test each nominal 1-month period for each affected facility according to the procedures in this section.
              (1) The owner or operator shall determine the composition of coatings by analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24, from data that have been determined by the coating manufacturer using Method 24, or by other methods approved by the Administrator.
              (2) The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and the mass of VOC used for dilution of coatings from company records during each nominal 1-month period. If a common coating distribution system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and nonaffected spray booths, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of coatings used at each facility by using procedures approved by the Administrator.

              (i) The owner or operator shall calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's in coatings emitted per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) at each coating operation [i.e., for each type of coating (prime, color, texture, and touch-up) used] during each nominal 1-month period for each affected facility. Each 1-month calculation is considered a performance test. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, N will be determined by the following procedures:
              (A) Calculate the mass of VOC's used (Mo + Md) for each coating operation during each nominal 1-month period for each affected facility by the following equation:

              (C) Select the appropriate transfer efficiency (T) from table 1 for each type of coating applications equipment used at each coating operation. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown are appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case basis. Transfer efficiency values for application methods not listed below shall be approved by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient data for the Administrator to judge the validity of the transfer efficiency claims.
              (D) Where more than one application method is used within a single coating operation, the owner or operator shall determine the volume of each coating applied by each method through a means acceptable to the Administrator and compute the volume-weighted average transfer efficiency by the following equation:

              (ii) Where the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) is less than or equal to 1.5 kilograms per liter for prime coats, is less than or equal to 1.5 kilograms per liter for color coats, is less than or equal to 2.3 kilograms per liter for texture coats, and is less than or equal to 2.3 kilograms per liter for touch-up coats, the affected facility is in compliance.
              (iii) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a VOC content (kg VOC/l of solids), as received, which when divided by the lowest transfer efficiency at which the coating is applied for each coating operation results in a value equal to or less than 1.5 kilograms per liter for prime and color coats and equal to or less than 2.3 kilograms per liter for texture and touch-up coats, the affected facility is in compliance provided that no VOC's are added to the coatings during distribution or application.

              Definitions, symbols, and cross-reference tables.
              (a) All terms used in this subpart not defined below have the meaning given to them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.

                Common emission control device means a device controlling emissions from an affected coating operation as well as from any other emission source.
              
                Concurrent means the period of time in which construction of an emission control device serving an affected facility is commenced or completed, beginning 6 months prior to the date that construction of the affected facility commences and ending 2 years after the date that construction of the affected facility is completed.
              
                Control device means any apparatus that reduces the quantity of a pollutant emitted to the air.

                Natural draft opening means any opening in a room, building, or total enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and that is not connected to a duct in which a fan is installed. The rate and direction of the natural draft across such an opening is a consequence of the difference in pressures on either side of the wall or barrier containing the opening.
              
                Nominal 1-month period means a calendar month or, if established prior to the performance test in a statement submitted with notification of anticipated startup pursuant to 40 CFR 60.7(a)(2), a similar monthly time period (e.g., 30-day month or accounting month).

                Temporary enclosure means a total enclosure that is constructed for the sole purpose of measuring the fugitive VOC emissions from an affected facility.
              
                Total enclosure means a structure that is constructed around a source of emissions and operated so that all VOC emissions are collected and exhausted through a stack or duct. With a total enclosure, there will be no fugitive emissions, only stack emissions. The drying oven itself may be part of the total enclosure.
              
                Vapor capture system means any device or combination of devices designed to contain, collect, and route solvent vapors released from the coating mix preparation equipment or coating operation.
              
                VOC in the applied coating means the product of Method 24 VOC analyses or formulation data (if those data are demonstrated to be equivalent to Method 24 results) and the total volume of coating fed to the coating applicator.
              
                VOC used means the amount of VOC delivered to the coating mix preparation equipment of the affected facility (including any contained in premixed coatings or other coating ingredients prepared off the plant site) for the formulation of polymeric coatings to be applied to supporting substrates at the coating operation, plus any solvent added after initial formulation is complete (e.g., dilution solvent added at the coating operation). If premixed coatings that require no mixing at the plant site are used, “VOC used” means the amount of VOC delivered to the coating applicator(s) of the affected facility.
              
                Volatile organic compounds or VOC means any organic compounds that participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions; or that are measured by a reference method, an equivalent method, an alternative method, or that are determined by procedures specified under any subpart.

              § 60.742
              Standards for volatile organic compounds.
              (a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that is subject to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with the emissions limitations set forth in this section on and after the date on which the initial performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated or 180 days after initial startup, whichever date comes first.
              (b) For the coating operation, each owner or operator of an affected facility shall either:
              (1) Reduce VOC emissions to the atmosphere from the coating operation by at least 90 percent (“emission reduction” standard); or
              (2) Install, operate, and maintain a total enclosure around the coating operation and vent the captured VOC emissions from the total enclosure to a control device that is at least 95 percent effecient (alternative standard).
              (c) For the onsite coating mix preparation equipment of an affected facility, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements, as applicable:

              § 60.743
              Compliance provisions.

              (a) To demonstrate compliance with the emission reduction standard for coating operations specified in § 60.742(b)(1), the owner or operator of the affected facility shall use one of the following methods.
              
              (1) Gaseous emission test for coating operations not using carbon adsorption beds with individual exhausts. This method is applicable when the emissions from any affected coating operation are controlled by a control device other than a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel. The owner or operator using this method shall comply with the following procedures:
              (i) Construct the vapor capture system and control device so that all gaseous volumetric flow rates and total VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 60.745(b) through (g);
              (ii) Determine capture efficiency from the coating operation by capturing, venting, and measuring all VOC emissions from the coating operation. During a performance test, the owner or operator of an affected coating operation located in an area with other sources of VOC shall isolate the coating operation emissions from all other sources of VOC by one of the following methods:
              (A) Build a temporary enclosure, as defined in § 60.741(a) and conforming to the requirements of § 60.743(b)(1), around the affected coating operation. The temporary enclosure must be constructed and ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal impact on performance of the capture system; or
              (B) Shut down all other sources of VOC and continue to exhaust fugitive emissions from the affected coating operation through any building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as those on drying ovens. All such ventilation air must be vented through stacks suitable for testing because the VOC content in each must be determined.
              (iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources connected and operating.
              (iv) Determine the efficiency (E) of the control device by Equation 1:
              
                EC01JN92.067
              
              (v) Determine the efficiency (F) of the vapor capture system by Equation 2:
              
                EC01JN92.068
              

              (vi) For each affected coating operation subject to § 60.742(b)(1) (emission reduction standard for coating operations), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (E)x(F) is equal to or greater than 0.90.
              
              (2) Gaseous emission test for coating operations using carbon adsorption beds with individual exhausts. This method is applicable when emissions from any affected coating operation are controlled by a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel. The owner or operator using this method shall comply with the following procedures:
              (i) Construct the vapor capture system and control device so that each volumetric flow rate and the total VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 60.745 (b) through (g);
              (ii) Assure that all VOC emissions from the coating operation are segregated from other VOC sources and that the emissions can be captured for measurement, as described in § 60.743(a)(1)(ii) (A) and (B);
              (iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources connected and operating;
              (iv) Determine the efficiency (Hv) of each individual adsorber vessel (v) using Equation 3:
              
                EC01JN92.069
              

              (v) Determine the efficiency of the carbon adsorption system (Hsys) by computing the average efficiency of the adsorber vessels as weighted by the volumetric flow rate (Qhv) of each individual adsorber vessel (v) using Equation 4:
              
                EC01JN92.070
              
              (vi) Determine the efficiency (F) of the vapor capture system using Equation (2).

              (vii) For each affected coating operation subject to § 60.742(b)(1) (emission reduction standard for coating operations), compliance is demonstrated if the product of (Hsys)x(F) is equal to or greater than 0.90.
              (3) Monthly liquid material balance. This method can be used only when a VOC recovery device controls only those emissions from one affected coating operation. It may not be used if the VOC recovery device controls emissions from any other VOC emission sources. When demonstrating compliance by this method, § 60.8(f) (Performance Tests) of this part does not apply. The owner or operator using this method shall comply with the following procedures to determine the VOC emission reduction for each nominal 1-month period:
              (i) Measure the amount of coating applied at the coating applicator. This quantity shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients (including any dilution solvent) have been added to the coating, or appropriate adjustments shall be made to account for any ingredients added after the amount of coating has been determined;

              (ii) Determine the VOC content of all coatings applied using the test method specified in § 60.745(a). This value shall be determined at a time and location in the process after all ingredients (including any dilution solvent) have been added to the coating, or appropriate adjustments shall be made to account for any ingredients added after the VOC content in the coating has been determined;
              (iii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a device that indicates the cumulative amount of VOC recovered by the control device over each nominal 1-month period. The device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±2.0 percent;
              (iv) Measure the amount of VOC recovered; and
              (v) Calculate the overall VOC emission reduction (R) for each and every nominal 1-month period using Equation 5. Emissions during startups and shutdowns are to be included when determining R because startups and shutdowns are part of normal operation for this source category.
              
                EC01JN92.071
              
              If the value of R is equal to or greater than 0.90, compliance with § 60.742(b)(1) is demonstrated.
              (A) The value of RSi is zero unless the owner or operator submits the following information to the Administrator for approval of a measured value of RSi that is greater than zero but less than or equal to 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied:
              (1) Measurement techniques; and
              (2) Documentation that the measured value of RSi exceeds zero but is less than or equal to 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied.

              (B) For those facilities not subject to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section, the value of RSi is zero unless the owner or operator submits the following information to the Administrator for approval of a measured value of RSi that is greater than 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied.
              (1) Measurement techniques;
              (2) Documentation that the measured value of RSi exceeds 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied; and
              (3) Either documentation of customer specifications requiring higher values or documentation that the desired properties of the product make it necessary for RSi to exceed 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied and that such properties cannot be achieved by other means.

              (C) The measurement techniques of paragraphs (a)(3)(v)(A)(1) and (a)(3)(v)(B)(1) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval with the notification of anticipated startup required under § 60.7(a)(2).
              (vi) The point at which Mr is to be measured shall be established when the compliance procedures are approved. The presumptive point of measurement shall be prior to separation/ purification; a point after separation/purification may be adopted for enhanced convenience or accuracy.
              (4) Short-term liquid material balance. This method may be used as an alternative to the monthly liquid material balance described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The owner or operator using this method shall comply with the following procedures to determine VOC emission reduction for a 3- to 7-day period and shall continuously monitor VOC emissions as specified in § 60.744.

              (i) Use the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) through (vi) of this section to determine the overall emission reduction, R. Compliance is demonstrated if the value of R is equal to or greater than 0.90.
              
              (ii) The number of days for the performance test (3 to 7) is to be based on the affected facility's representative performance consistent with the requirements of § 60.8(c). Data demonstrating that the chosen test period is representative shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval with the notification of anticipated startup required under § 60.7(a)(2).
              (b) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation subject to the standard specified in § 60.742(b)(2) (alternative standard for coating operations) shall:
              (1) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. The total enclosure shall either be approved by the Administrator in accordance with the provisions of § 60.746, or meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (vi) of this section, as follows:
              (i) The only openings in the enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and natural draft openings such as those through which raw materials enter and exist the coating operation;
              (ii) Total area of all natural draft openings does not exceed 5 percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, and ceiling;
              (iii) All access doors and windows are closed during normal operation of the enclosed coating operation, except for brief, occasional openings to accommodate process equipment adjustments. If such openings are frequent, or if the access door or window remains open for a significant amount of time during the process operation, it must be considered a natural draft opening. Access doors used routinely by workers to enter and exit the enclosed area shall be equipped with automatic closure devices;
              (iv) Average inward face velocity (FV) across all natural draft openings is a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the following procedures:
              (A) Construct all forced makeup air ducts and all exhaust ducts so that the volumetric flow rate in each can be accurately determined by the test methods and procedures specified in § 60.745 (c) and (d). Volumetric flow rates shall be calculated without the adjustment normally made for moisture content; and
              (B) Determine FV by Equation 6:
              
                EC01JN92.072
              
              (v) The air passing through all natural draft openings flows into the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 meters per hour, the continuous inward airflow shall be verified by continuous observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or other means approved by the Administrator over the period that the volumetric flow rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If FV is greater than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow thourgh the natural draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all times without verification.
              (vi) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft opening.
              (2) Determine the control device efficiency using Equation (1) or Equations (3) and (4), as applicable, and the test methods and procedures specified in § 60.745 (b) through (g).

              (3) Compliance is demonstrated if the installation of a total enclosure is demonstrated and the value of E determined from Equation (1) or the value of Hsys determined from Equations (3) and (4), as applicable, is equal to or greater than 0.95.
              (c) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.742(c)(1) (standard for coating mix preparation equipment servicing a coating operation with concurrent construction of a control device that uses at least 130 Mg per year of VOC), each owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment shall demonstrate that:

              (d) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.742(c)(2) (standard for coating mix preparation equipment servicing a coating operation that does not have concurrent construction of a control device but uses at least 130 Mg of VOC per year) or § 60.742(c)(3) (standard for coating mix preparation equipment servicing a coating operation that uses at least 95 Mg but less than 130 Mg of VOC per year), each owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment shall demonstrate upon inspection that:
              (1) Covers satisfying the specifications in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (v) of this section have been installed and are being properly operated and maintained; and

              (g) Each owner or operator of an affected facility who demonstrates compliance by the test methods described in § 60.743(a)(1) or (2) (which include vapor capture system efficiency determinations) or § 60.743(a)(4) (short-term liquid material balance) shall submit a monitoring plan for the vapor capture system to the Administrator for approval with the notification of anticipated startup required under § 60.7(a)(2) of the General Provisions. This plan shall identify the parameter to be monitored as an indicator of vapor capture system performance (e.g., the amperage to the exhaust fans or duct flow rates) and the method for monitoring the chosen parameter. The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the value of the chosen parameter.

              § 60.745
              Test methods and procedures.
              Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance as follows:
              (a) Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that coating formulation data are equivalent to Method 24 results, formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24 test and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24 test will govern. For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample collected in a 1-liter container at a point in the process where the sample will be representative of the coating applied to the substrate (i.e., the sample shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added during the manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed immediately after the sample is collected. Any solvent or other VOC added after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the calculations that use Method 24 results.
              (b) Method 25 shall be used to determine VOC concentrations from incinerator gas streams. Alternative Methods (18 or 25A), may be used as explained in the applicability section of Method 25 in cases where use of Method 25 is demonstrated to be technically infeasible. The owner or operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with the notification of the performance test required under § 60.8(d) of the General Provisions. Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.
              (1) When the method is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels pursuant to § 60.743 (a)(1), (b), or (c), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete system rotations through the adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.
              (2) When the method is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel pursuant to § 60.743 (a)(2), (b), or (c), each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. Each test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete adsorption cycles.
              (c) Method 1 or 1A is used for sample and velocity traverses;

              (d) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D is used for velocity and volumetric flow rates;
              
              (e) Method 3 is used for gas analysis;
              (f) Method 4 is used for stack gas moisture;
              (g) Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D; 3; and 4 shall be performed, as applicable, at least twice during each test run.
            
            
              § 60.746
              Permission to use alternative means of emission limitation.

              (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of VOC from any emission point subject to § 60.742(c) at least equivalent to that required by § 60.742(b)(2) or § 60.742(c), respectively, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means. The Administrator may condition permission on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the same emission reduction as specified in § 60.742(b)(2) or § 60.742(c), respectively.
              (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.
              (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit to the Administrator either results from an emission test that accurately collects and measures all VOC emissions from a given control device or an engineering evaluation that accurately determines such emissions.
            
            
              § 60.747

              § 60.751
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act or in subpart A of this part.
              
                Active collection system means a gas collection system that uses gas mover equipment.
              
                Active landfill means a landfill in which solid waste is being placed or a landfill that is planned to accept waste in the future.
              
                Closed landfill means a landfill in which solid waste is no longer being placed, and in which no additional solid wastes will be placed without first filing a notification of modification as prescribed under § 60.7(a)(4). Once a notification of modification has been filed, and additional solid waste is placed in the landfill, the landfill is no longer closed.
              
                Closure means that point in time when a landfill becomes a closed landfill.
              
              
                Commercial solid waste means all types of solid waste generated by stores, offices, restaurants, warehouses, and other nonmanufacturing activities, excluding residential and industrial wastes.
              
                Controlled landfill means any landfill at which collection and control systems are required under this subpart as a result of the nonmethane organic compounds emission rate. The landfill is considered controlled at the time a collection and control system design plan is submitted in compliance with § 60.752(b)(2)(i).
              
                Design capacity means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill can accept, as indicated in terms of volume or mass in the most recent permit issued by the State, local, or Tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site specific density, which must be recalculated annually.
              
                Disposal facility means all contiguous land and structures, other appurtenances, and improvements on the land used for the disposal of solid waste.
              
                Emission rate cutoff means the threshold annual emission rate to which a landfill compares its estimated emission rate to determine if control under the regulation is required.
              
                Enclosed combustor means an enclosed firebox which maintains a relatively constant limited peak temperature generally using a limited supply of combustion air. An enclosed flare is considered an enclosed combustor.
              
                Flare means an open combustor without enclosure or shroud.
              
                Gas mover equipment means the equipment (i.e., fan, blower, compressor) used to transport landfill gas through the header system.
              
                Household waste means any solid waste (including garbage, trash, and sanitary waste in septic tanks) derived from households (including, but not limited to, single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day-use recreation areas).
              
                Industrial solid waste means solid waste generated by manufacturing or industrial processes that is not a hazardous waste regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, parts 264 and 265 of this title. Such waste may include, but is not limited to, waste resulting from the following manufacturing processes: electric power generation; fertilizer/agricultural chemicals; food and related products/by-products; inorganic chemicals; iron and steel manufacturing; leather and leather products; nonferrous metals manufacturing/foundries; organic chemicals; plastics and resins manufacturing; pulp and paper industry; rubber and miscellaneous plastic products; stone, glass, clay, and concrete products; textile manufacturing; transportation equipment; and water treatment. This term does not include mining waste or oil and gas waste.
              
                Interior well means any well or similar collection component located inside the perimeter of the landfill waste. A perimeter well located outside the landfilled waste is not an interior well.
              
                Landfill means an area of land or an excavation in which wastes are placed for permanent disposal, and that is not a land application unit, surface impoundment, injection well, or waste pile as those terms are defined under § 257.2 of this title.
              
                Lateral expansion means a horizontal expansion of the waste boundaries of an existing MSW landfill. A lateral expansion is not a modification unless it results in an increase in the design capacity of the landfill.
              
                Modification means an increase in the permitted volume design capacity of the landfill by either horizontal or vertical expansion based on its permitted design capacity as of May 30, 1991. Modification does not occur until the owner or operator commences construction on the horizontal or vertical expansion.
              
                Municipal solid waste landfill or MSW landfill means an entire disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household waste is placed in or on land. An MSW landfill may also receive other types of RCRA Subtitle D wastes (§ 257.2 of this title) such as commercial solid waste, nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW landfill may be separated by access roads. An MSW landfill may be publicly or privately owned. An MSW landfill may be a new MSW landfill, an existing MSW landfill, or a lateral expansion.
              
                Municipal solid waste landfill emissions or MSW landfill emissions means gas generated by the decomposition of organic waste deposited in an MSW landfill or derived from the evolution of organic compounds in the waste.
              
                NMOC means nonmethane organic compounds, as measured according to the provisions of § 60.754.
              
                Nondegradable waste means any waste that does not decompose through chemical breakdown or microbiological activity. Examples are, but are not limited to, concrete, municipal waste combustor ash, and metals.
              
                Passive collection system means a gas collection system that solely uses positive pressure within the landfill to move the gas rather than using gas mover equipment.
              
                Sludge means any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility, exclusive of the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant.
              
                Solid waste means any garbage, sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities, but does not include solid or dissolved material in domestic sewage, or solid or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or industrial discharges that are point sources subject to permits under 33 U.S.C. 1342, or source, special nuclear, or by-product material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C 2011 et seq.).
              
                Sufficient density means any number, spacing, and combination of collection system components, including vertical wells, horizontal collectors, and surface collectors, necessary to maintain emission and migration control as determined by measures of performance set forth in this part.
              
                Sufficient extraction rate means a rate sufficient to maintain a negative pressure at all wellheads in the collection system without causing air infiltration, including any wellheads connected to the system as a result of expansion or excess surface emissions, for the life of the blower.
              [61 FR 9919, Mar. 12, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 32750, June 16, 1998; 64 FR 9262, Feb. 24, 1999]
            
            
              § 60.752
              Standards for air emissions from municipal solid waste landfills.
              (a) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams by mass or 2.5 million cubic meters by volume shall submit an initial design capacity report to the Administrator as provided in § 60.757(a). The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. Any density conversions shall be documented and submitted with the report. Submittal of the initial design capacity report shall fulfill the requirements of this subpart except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator an amended design capacity report, as provided for in § 60.757(a)(3).

              (2) When an increase in the maximum design capacity of a landfill exempted from the provisions of §§ 60.752(b) through 60.759 of this subpart on the basis of the design capacity exemption in paragraph (a) of this section results in a revised maximum design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, the owner or operator shall comply with the provision of paragraph (b) of this section.
              
              (b) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, shall either comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this section or calculate an NMOC emission rate for the landfill using the procedures specified in § 60.754. The NMOC emission rate shall be recalculated annually, except as provided in § 60.757(b)(1)(ii) of this subpart. The owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters is subject to part 70 or 71 permitting requirements.
              (1) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall:
              (i) Submit an annual emission report to the Administrator, except as provided for in § 60.757(b)(1)(ii); and
              (ii) Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the procedures specified in § 60.754(a)(1) until such time as the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, or the landfill is closed.
              (A) If the NMOC emission rate, upon recalculation required in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall install a collection and control system in compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (B) If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure notification shall be submitted to the Administrator as provided for in § 60.757(d).
              (2) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall:
              (i) Submit a collection and control system design plan prepared by a professional engineer to the Administrator within 1 year:
              (A) The collection and control system as described in the plan shall meet the design requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (B) The collection and control system design plan shall include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting provisions of §§ 60.753 through 60.758 proposed by the owner or operator.
              (C) The collection and control system design plan shall either conform with specifications for active collection systems in § 60.759 or include a demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction of the sufficiency of the alternative provisions to § 60.759.
              (D) The Administrator shall review the information submitted under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A),(B) and (C) of this section and either approve it, disapprove it, or request that additional information be submitted. Because of the many site-specific factors involved with landfill gas system design, alternative systems may be necessary. A wide variety of system designs are possible, such as vertical wells, combination horizontal and vertical collection systems, or horizontal trenches only, leachate collection components, and passive systems.
              (ii) Install a collection and control system that captures the gas generated within the landfill as required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section within 30 months after the first annual report in which the emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams per year, unless Tier 2 or Tier 3 sampling demonstrates that the emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, as specified in § 60.757(c)(1) or (2).
              (A) An active collection system shall:
              (1) Be designed to handle the maximum expected gas flow rate from the entire area of the landfill that warrants control over the intended use period of the gas control or treatment system equipment;
              (2) Collect gas from each area, cell, or group of cells in the landfill in which the initial solid waste has been placed for a period of:
              (i) 5 years or more if active; or
              (ii) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.
              (3) Collect gas at a sufficient extraction rate;
              (4) Be designed to minimize off-site migration of subsurface gas.
              (B) A passive collection system shall:
              (1) Comply with the provisions specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), (2), and (2)(ii)(A)(4) of this section.
              
              (2) Be installed with liners on the bottom and all sides in all areas in which gas is to be collected. The liners shall be installed as required under § 258.40.

              (A) An open flare designed and operated in accordance with § 60.18 except as noted in § 60.754(e);
              (B) A control system designed and operated to reduce NMOC by 98 weight-percent, or, when an enclosed combustion device is used for control, to either reduce NMOC by 98 weight percent or reduce the outlet NMOC concentration to less than 20 parts per million by volume, dry basis as hexane at 3 percent oxygen. The reduction efficiency or parts per million by volume shall be established by an initial performance test to be completed no later than 180 days after the initial startup of the approved control system using the test methods specified in § 60.754(d).
              (1) If a boiler or process heater is used as the control device, the landfill gas stream shall be introduced into the flame zone.
              (2) The control device shall be operated within the parameter ranges established during the initial or most recent performance test. The operating parameters to be monitored are specified in § 60.756;
              (C) Route the collected gas to a treatment system that processes the collected gas for subsequent sale or use. All emissions from any atmospheric vent from the gas treatment system shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) (A) or (B) of this section.

              § 60.753
              Operational standards for collection and control systems.
              Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 60.752(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart shall:
              (a) Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid waste has been in place for:
              (1) 5 years or more if active; or
              (2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade;
              (b) Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each wellhead except under the following conditions:
              (1) A fire or increased well temperature. The owner or operator shall record instances when positive pressure occurs in efforts to avoid a fire. These records shall be submitted with the annual reports as provided in § 60.757(f)(1);
              (2) Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator shall develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan;
              (3) A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design changes shall be approved by the Administrator;
              (c) Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a landfill gas temperature less than 55 °C and with either a nitrogen level less than 20 percent or an oxygen level less than 5 percent. The owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature, nitrogen, or oxygen value at a particular well. A higher operating value demonstration shall show supporting data that the elevated parameter does not cause fires or significantly inhibit anaerobic decomposition by killing methanogens.
              (1) The nitrogen level shall be determined using Method 3C, unless an alternative test method is established as allowed by § 60.752(b)(2)(i) of this subpart.
              (2) Unless an alternative test method is established as allowed by § 60.752(b)(2)(i) of this subpart, the oxygen shall be determined by an oxygen meter using Method 3A or 3C except that:
              (i) The span shall be set so that the regulatory limit is between 20 and 50 percent of the span;
              (ii) A data recorder is not required;
              (iii) Only two calibration gases are required, a zero and span, and ambient air may be used as the span;
              (iv) A calibration error check is not required;
              (v) The allowable sample bias, zero drift, and calibration drift are ±10 percent.
              (d) Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration is less than 500 parts per million above background at the surface of the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or operator shall conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at 30 meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover. The owner or operator may establish an alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A surface monitoring design plan shall be developed that includes a topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any site-specific deviations from the 30 meter intervals. Areas with steep slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface testing.
              (e) Operate the system such that all collected gases are vented to a control system designed and operated in compliance with § 60.752(b)(2)(iii). In the event the collection or control system is inoperable, the gas mover system shall be shut down and all valves in the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to the atmosphere shall be closed within 1 hour; and

              (f) Operate the control or treatment system at all times when the collected gas is routed to the system.
              
              (g) If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective action shall be taken as specified in § 60.755(a)(3) through (5) or § 60.755(c) of this subpart. If corrective actions are taken as specified in § 60.755, the monitored exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements in this section.

              § 60.754
              Test methods and procedures.

              (a)(1) The landfill owner or operator shall calculate the NMOC emission rate using either the equation provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or the equation provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. Both equations may be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i), for part of the life of the landfill and the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is unknown, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii), for part of the life of the landfill. The values to be used in both equations are 0.05 per year for k, 170 cubic meters per megagram for LO, and 4,000 parts per million by volume as hexane for the CNMOC. For landfills located in geographical areas with a thirty year annual average precipitation of less than 25 inches, as measured at the nearest representative official meteorologic site, the k value to be used is 0.02 per year.
              (i) The following equation shall be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known.
              
                ER12MR96.025
              
              
                where,
                
                MNMOC = Total NMOC emission rate from the landfill, megagrams per year
                k = methane generation rate constant, year−1
                
                Lo = methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste
                Mi = mass of solid waste in the ith section, megagrams
                ti = age of the ith section, years
                CNMOC = concentration of NMOC, parts per million by volume as hexane
                3.6 × 10−9 = conversion factor
                

                The mass of nondegradable solid waste may be subtracted from the total mass of solid waste in a particular section of the landfill when calculating the value for Mi if documentation of the nature and amount of such wastes is maintained
              
              

              (ii) The following equation shall be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is unknown.
              
              MNMOC = 2Lo R (e−kc−e−kt) CNMOC (3.6 × 10−9)
              
              
                Where:
                
                MNMOC = mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year
                Lo = methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste
                R = average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year
                k = methane generation rate constant, year−1
                
                t = age of landfill, years
                CNMOC = concentration of NMOC, parts per million by volume as hexane

                c = time since closure, years; for active landfill c = O and e−kc1
                3.6 × 10−9 = conversion factor
              
              
              The mass of nondegradable solid waste may be subtracted from the total mass of solid waste in a particular section of the landfill when calculating the value of R, if documentation of the nature and amount of such wastes is maintained.
              (2) Tier 1. The owner or operator shall compare the calculated NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 50 megagrams per year.
              (i) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is less than 50 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner shall submit an emission rate report as provided in § 60.757(b)(1), and shall recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under § 60.752(b)(1).

              (ii) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner shall either comply with § 60.752(b)(2), or determine a site-specific NMOC concentration and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the procedures provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
              (3) Tier 2. The landfill owner or operator shall determine the NMOC concentration using the following sampling procedure. The landfill owner or operator shall install at least two sample probes per hectare of landfill surface that has retained waste for at least 2 years. If the landfill is larger than 25 hectares in area, only 50 samples are required. The sample probes should be located to avoid known areas of nondegradable solid waste. The owner or operator shall collect and analyze one sample of landfill gas from each probe to determine the NMOC concentration using Method 25 or 25C of appendix A of this part. Method 18 of appendix A of this part may be used to analyze the samples collected by the Method 25 or 25C sampling procedure. Taking composite samples from different probes into a single cylinder is allowed; however, equal sample volumes must be taken from each probe. For each composite, the sampling rate, collection times, beginning and ending cylinder vacuums, or alternative volume measurements must be recorded to verify that composite volumes are equal. Composite sample volumes should not be less than one liter unless evidence can be provided to substantiate the accuracy of smaller volumes. Terminate compositing before the cylinder approaches ambient pressure where measurement accuracy diminishes. If using Method 18, the owner or operator must identify all compounds in the sample and, as a minimum, test for those compounds published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42), minus carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and mercury. As a minimum, the instrument must be calibrated for each of the compounds on the list. Convert the concentration of each Method 18 compound to CNMOC as hexane by multiplying by the ratio of its carbon atoms divided by six. If more than the required number of samples are taken, all samples must be used in the analysis. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from Method 25 or 25C of appendix A of this part by six to convert from CNMOC as carbon to CNMOC as hexane. If the landfill has an active or passive gas removal system in place, Method 25 or 25C samples may be collected from these systems instead of surface probes provided the removal system can be shown to provide sampling as representative as the two sampling probe per hectare requirement. For active collection systems, samples may be collected from the common header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment. For these systems, a minimum of three samples must be collected from the header pipe.
              (i) The landfill owner or operator shall recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate using the equations provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section and using the average NMOC concentration from the collected samples instead of the default value in the equation provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (ii) If the resulting mass emission rate calculated using the site-specific NMOC concentration is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner or operator shall either comply with § 60.752(b)(2), or determine the site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the site-specific methane generation rate using the procedure specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
              (iii) If the resulting NMOC mass emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall submit a periodic estimate of the emission rate report as provided in § 60.757(b)(1) and retest the site-specific NMOC concentration every 5 years using the methods specified in this section.
              (4) Tier 3. The site-specific methane generation rate constant shall be determined using the procedures provided in Method 2E of appendix A of this part. The landfill owner or operator shall estimate the NMOC mass emission rate using equations in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section and using a site-specific methane generation rate constant k, and the site-specific NMOC concentration as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section instead of the default values provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The landfill owner or operator shall compare the resulting NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 50 megagrams per year.
              (i) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the site-specific methane generation rate and concentration of NMOC is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall comply with § 60.752(b)(2).
              (ii) If the NMOC mass emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator shall submit a periodic emission rate report as provided in § 60.757(b)(1) and shall recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually, as provided in § 60.757(b)(1) using the equations in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and using the site-specific methane generation rate constant and NMOC concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The calculation of the methane generation rate constant is performed only once, and the value obtained from this test shall be used in all subsequent annual NMOC emission rate calculations.
              (5) The owner or operator may use other methods to determine the NMOC concentration or a site-specific k as an alternative to the methods required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section if the method has been approved by the Administrator.

              (b) After the installation of a collection and control system in compliance with § 60.755, the owner or operator shall calculate the NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be removed as provided in § 60.752(b)(2)(v), using the following equation:
              
              MNMOC = 1.89 × 10−3 QLFG CNMOC
              
              
              
                where,
                
                MNMOC = mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year
                QLFG = flow rate of landfill gas, cubic meters per minute
                CNMOC = NMOC concentration, parts per million by volume as hexane
              
              
              (1) The flow rate of landfill gas, QLFG, shall be determined by measuring the total landfill gas flow rate at the common header pipe that leads to the control device using a gas flow measuring device calibrated according to the provisions of section 4 of Method 2E of appendix A of this part.
              (2) The average NMOC concentration, CNMOC, shall be determined by collecting and analyzing landfill gas sampled from the common header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment using the procedures in Method 25C or Method 18 of appendix A of this part. If using Method 18 of appendix A of this part, the minimum list of compounds to be tested shall be those published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42). The sample location on the common header pipe shall be before any condensate removal or other gas refining units. The landfill owner or operator shall divide the NMOC concentration from Method 25C of appendix A of this part by six to convert from CNMOC as carbon to CNMOC as hexane.
              (3) The owner or operator may use another method to determine landfill gas flow rate and NMOC concentration if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
              (c) When calculating emissions for PSD purposes, the owner or operator of each MSW landfill subject to the provisions of this subpart shall estimate the NMOC emission rate for comparison to the PSD major source and significance levels in §§ 51.166 or 52.21 of this chapter using AP-42 or other approved measurement procedures.

              (d) For the performance test required in § 60.752(b)(2)(iii)(B), Method 25, 25C, or Method 18 of appendix A of this part must be used to determine compliance with the 98 weight-percent efficiency or the 20 ppmv outlet concentration level, unless another method to demonstrate compliance has been approved by the Administrator as provided by § 60.752(b)(2)(i)(B). Method 3 or 3A shall be used to determine oxygen for correcting the NMOC concentration as hexane to 3 percent. In cases where the outlet concentration is less than 50 ppm NMOC as carbon (8 ppm NMOC as hexane), Method 25A should be used in place of Method 25. If using Method 18 of appendix A of this part, the minimum list of compounds to be tested shall be those published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42). The following equation shall be used to calculate efficiency:
              
              Control Efficiency = (NMOCin − NMOCout)/(NMOCin)
              
              
                where,
                
                NMOCin = mass of NMOC entering control device
                NMOCout = mass of NMOC exiting control device
              
              (e) For the performance test required in § 60.752(b)(2)(iii)(A), the net heating value of the combusted landfill gas as determined in § 60.18(f)(3) is calculated from the concentration of methane in the landfill gas as measured by Method 3C. A minimum of three 30-minute Method 3C samples are determined. The measurement of other organic components, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide is not applicable. Method 3C may be used to determine the landfill gas molecular weight for calculating the flare gas exit velocity under § 60.18(f)(4).

              (1) For the purposes of calculating the maximum expected gas generation flow rate from the landfill to determine compliance with § 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), one of the following equations shall be used. The k and Lo kinetic factors should be those published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42) or other site specific values demonstrated to be appropriate and approved by the Administrator. If k has been determined as specified in § 60.754(a)(4), the value of k determined from the test shall be used. A value of no more than 15 years shall be used for the intended use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill is the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until closure.

                ti = age of the ith section, years
              
              
              (iii) If a collection and control system has been installed, actual flow data may be used to project the maximum expected gas generation flow rate instead of, or in conjunction with, the equations in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. If the landfill is still accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal the maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using the equations in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) or (ii) or other methods shall be used to predict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the intended period of use of the gas control system equipment.

              (2) For the purposes of determining sufficient density of gas collectors for compliance with § 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2), the owner or operator shall design a system of vertical wells, horizontal collectors, or other collection devices, satisfactory to the Administrator, capable of controlling and extracting gas from all portions of the landfill sufficient to meet all operational and performance standards.

              (3) For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection system flow rate is sufficient to determine compliance with § 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(3), the owner or operator shall measure gauge pressure in the gas collection header at each individual well, monthly. If a positive pressure exists, action shall be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days, except for the three conditions allowed under § 60.753(b). If negative pressure cannot be achieved without excess air infiltration within 15 calendar days of the first measurement, the gas collection system shall be expanded to correct the exceedance within 120 days of the initial measurement of positive pressure. Any attempted corrective measure shall not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards. An alternative timeline for correcting the exceedance may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
              (4) Owners or operators are not required to expand the system as required in paragraph (a)(3) of this section during the first 180 days after gas collection system startup.
              (5) For the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator shall monitor each well monthly for temperature and nitrogen or oxygen as provided in § 60.753(c). If a well exceeds one of these operating parameters, action shall be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days. If correction of the exceedance cannot be achieved within 15 calendar days of the first measurement, the gas collection system shall be expanded to correct the exceedance within 120 days of the initial exceedance. Any attempted corrective measure shall not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards. An alternative timeline for correcting the exceedance may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.

              (6) An owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(4) through the use of a collection system not conforming to the specifications provided in § 60.759 shall provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as specified in § 60.752(b)(2)(i)(C) demonstrating that off-site migration is being controlled.
              (b) For purposes of compliance with § 60.753(a), each owner or operator of a controlled landfill shall place each well or design component as specified in the approved design plan as provided in § 60.752(b)(2)(i). Each well shall be installed no later than 60 days after the date on which the initial solid waste has been in place for a period of:
              (1) 5 years or more if active; or
              (2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.
              (c) The following procedures shall be used for compliance with the surface methane operational standard as provided in § 60.753(d).
              (1) After installation of the collection system, the owner or operator shall monitor surface concentrations of methane along the entire perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at 30 meter intervals (or a site-specific established spacing) for each collection area on a quarterly basis using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) The background concentration shall be determined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind outside the boundary of the landfill at a distance of at least 30 meters from the perimeter wells.
              (3) Surface emission monitoring shall be performed in accordance with section 4.3.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that the probe inlet shall be placed within 5 to 10 centimeters of the ground. Monitoring shall be performed during typical meteorological conditions.

              (4) Any reading of 500 parts per million or more above background at any location shall be recorded as a monitored exceedance and the actions specified in paragraphs (c)(4) (i) through (v) of this section shall be taken. As long as the specified actions are taken, the exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements of § 60.753(d).
              (i) The location of each monitored exceedance shall be marked and the location recorded.
              (ii) Cover maintenance or adjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent wells to increase the gas collection in the vicinity of each exceedance shall be made and the location shall be re-monitored within 10 calendar days of detecting the exceedance.
              (iii) If the re-monitoring of the location shows a second exceedance, additional corrective action shall be taken and the location shall be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If the re-monitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section shall be taken, and no further monitoring of that location is required until the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) has been taken.
              (iv) Any location that initially showed an exceedance but has a methane concentration less than 500 ppm methane above background at the 10-day re-monitoring specified in paragraph (c)(4) (ii) or (iii) of this section shall be re-monitored 1 month from the initial exceedance. If the 1-month remonitoring shows a concentration less than 500 parts per million above background, no further monitoring of that location is required until the next quarterly monitoring period. If the 1-month remonitoring shows an exceedance, the actions specified in paragraph (c)(4) (iii) or (v) shall be taken.
              (v) For any location where monitored methane concentration equals or exceeds 500 parts per million above background three times within a quarterly period, a new well or other collection device shall be installed within 120 calendar days of the initial exceedance. An alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading the blower, header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for installation may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
              (5) The owner or operator shall implement a program to monitor for cover integrity and implement cover repairs as necessary on a monthly basis.
              (d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section shall comply with the following instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission monitoring devices:
              (1) The portable analyzer shall meet the instrument specifications provided in section 3 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that “methane” shall replace all references to VOC.
              (2) The calibration gas shall be methane, diluted to a nominal concentration of 500 parts per million in air.
              (3) To meet the performance evaluation requirements in section 3.1.3 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, the instrument evaluation procedures of section 4.4 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part shall be used.
              (4) The calibration procedures provided in section 4.2 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part shall be followed immediately before commencing a surface monitoring survey.
              (e) The provisions of this subpart apply at all times, except during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, provided that the duration of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction shall not exceed 5 days for collection systems and shall not exceed 1 hour for treatment or control devices.

              (ii) If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual report to the Administrator is less than 50 megagrams per year in each of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to submit an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period in lieu of the annual report. This estimate shall include the current amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated waste acceptance rate for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based shall be provided to the Administrator. This estimate shall be revised at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year estimate, a revised 5-year estimate shall be submitted to the Administrator. The revised estimate shall cover the 5-year period beginning with the year in which the actual waste acceptance rate exceeded the estimated waste acceptance rate.
              (2) The NMOC emission rate report shall include all the data, calculations, sample reports and measurements used to estimate the annual or 5-year emissions.

              (1) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in § 60.754(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting shall be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year or the landfill is closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, shall be submitted within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 50 megagrams per year.
              (2) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant (k), as provided in Tier 3 in § 60.754(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC emission rate is less than 50 Mg/yr, annual periodic reporting shall be resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant (k) shall be used in the emission rate calculation until such time as the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of § 60.754(a)(4) and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant (k) shall be submitted to the Administrator within 1 year of the first calculated emission rate exceeding 50 megagrams per year.

              § 60.759
              Specifications for active collection systems.
              (a) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.752(b)(2)(i) shall site active collection wells, horizontal collectors, surface collectors, or other extraction devices at a sufficient density throughout all gas producing areas using the following procedures unless alternative procedures have been approved by the Administrator as provided in § 60.752(b)(2)(i)(C) and (D):
              (1) The collection devices within the interior and along the perimeter areas shall be certified to achieve comprehensive control of surface gas emissions by a professional engineer. The following issues shall be addressed in the design: depths of refuse, refuse gas generation rates and flow characteristics, cover properties, gas system expandibility, leachate and condensate management, accessibility, compatibility with filling operations, integration with closure end use, air intrusion control, corrosion resistance, fill settlement, and resistance to the refuse decomposition heat.
              (2) The sufficient density of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall address landfill gas migration issues and augmentation of the collection system through the use of active or passive systems at the landfill perimeter or exterior.
              (3) The placement of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall control all gas producing areas, except as provided by paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Any segregated area of asbestos or nondegradable material may be excluded from collection if documented as provided under § 60.758(d). The documentation shall provide the nature, date of deposition, location and amount of asbestos or nondegradable material deposited in the area, and shall be provided to the Administrator upon request.

              (ii) Any nonproductive area of the landfill may be excluded from control, provided that the total of all excluded areas can be shown to contribute less than 1 percent of the total amount of NMOC emissions from the landfill. The amount, location, and age of the material shall be documented and provided to the Administrator upon request. A separate NMOC emissions estimate shall be made for each section proposed for exclusion, and the sum of all such sections shall be compared to the NMOC emissions estimate for the entire landfill. Emissions from each section shall be computed using the following equation:
                
              
              Qi = 2 k Lo Mi (e-kt i) (CNMOC) (3.6 × 10−9)
              
              
                where,
                
                Qi = NMOC emission rate from the ith section, megagrams per year
                k = methane generation rate constant, year−1
                
                Lo = methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste
                Mi = mass of the degradable solid waste in the ith section, megagram
                ti = age of the solid waste in the ith section, years
                CNMOC = concentration of nonmethane organic compounds, parts per million by volume
                3.6 × 10−9 = conversion factor
              
              
              (iii) The values for k and CNMOC determined in field testing shall be used if field testing has been performed in determining the NMOC emission rate or the radii of influence (this distance from the well center to a point in the landfill where the pressure gradient applied by the blower or compressor approaches zero). If field testing has not been performed, the default values for k, LO and CNMOC provided in § 60.754(a)(1) or the alternative values from § 60.754(a)(5) shall be used. The mass of nondegradable solid waste contained within the given section may be subtracted from the total mass of the section when estimating emissions provided the nature, location, age, and amount of the nondegradable material is documented as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
              (b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.752(b)(2)(i)(A) shall construct the gas collection devices using the following equipment or procedures:
              (1) The landfill gas extraction components shall be constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous corrosion resistant material of suitable dimensions to: convey projected amounts of gases; withstand installation, static, and settlement forces; and withstand planned overburden or traffic loads. The collection system shall extend as necessary to comply with emission and migration standards. Collection devices such as wells and horizontal collectors shall be perforated to allow gas entry without head loss sufficient to impair performance across the intended extent of control. Perforations shall be situated with regard to the need to prevent excessive air infiltration.
              (2) Vertical wells shall be placed so as not to endanger underlying liners and shall address the occurrence of water within the landfill. Holes and trenches constructed for piped wells and horizontal collectors shall be of sufficient cross-section so as to allow for their proper construction and completion including, for example, centering of pipes and placement of gravel backfill. Collection devices shall be designed so as not to allow indirect short circuiting of air into the cover or refuse into the collection system or gas into the air. Any gravel used around pipe perforations should be of a dimension so as not to penetrate or block perforations.
              (3) Collection devices may be connected to the collection header pipes below or above the landfill surface. The connector assembly shall include a positive closing throttle valve, any necessary seals and couplings, access couplings and at least one sampling port. The collection devices shall be constructed of PVC, HDPE, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous material of suitable thickness.
              (c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.752(b)(2)(i)(A) shall convey the landfill gas to a control system in compliance with § 60.752(b)(2)(iii) through the collection header pipe(s). The gas mover equipment shall be sized to handle the maximum gas generation flow rate expected over the intended use period of the gas moving equipment using the following procedures:
              (1) For existing collection systems, the flow data shall be used to project the maximum flow rate. If no flow data exists, the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be used.
              (2) For new collection systems, the maximum flow rate shall be in accordance with § 60.755(a)(1).

              Applicability, designation of affected source, and delegation of authority.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to each municipal solid waste landfill that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification after July 17, 2014. Physical or operational changes made to an MSW landfill solely to comply with subparts Cc, Cf, or WWW of this part are not considered construction, reconstruction, or modification for the purposes of this section.
              (b) The following authorities are retained by the Administrator and are not transferred to the state: § 60.764(a)(5).
              (c) Activities required by or conducted pursuant to a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), or state remedial action are not considered construction, reconstruction, or modification for purposes of this subpart.
            
            
              § 60.761
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein have the meaning given them in the Act or in subpart A of this part.
              
                Active collection system means a gas collection system that uses gas mover equipment.
              
                Active landfill means a landfill in which solid waste is being placed or a landfill that is planned to accept waste in the future.
              
                Closed area means a separately lined area of an MSW landfill in which solid waste is no longer being placed. If additional solid waste is placed in that area of the landfill, that landfill area is no longer closed. The area must be separately lined to ensure that the landfill gas does not migrate between open and closed areas.
              
                Closed landfill means a landfill in which solid waste is no longer being placed, and in which no additional solid wastes will be placed without first filing a notification of modification as prescribed under § 60.7(a)(4). Once a notification of modification has been filed, and additional solid waste is placed in the landfill, the landfill is no longer closed.
              
                Closure means that point in time when a landfill becomes a closed landfill.
              
                Commercial solid waste means all types of solid waste generated by stores, offices, restaurants, warehouses, and other nonmanufacturing activities, excluding residential and industrial wastes.
              
                Controlled landfill means any landfill at which collection and control systems are required under this subpart as a result of the nonmethane organic compounds emission rate. The landfill is considered controlled at the time a collection and control system design plan is submitted in compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(i).
              
                Corrective action analysis means a description of all reasonable interim and long-term measures, if any, that are available, and an explanation of why the selected corrective action(s) is/are the best alternative(s), including, but not limited to, considerations of cost effectiveness, technical feasibility, safety, and secondary impacts.
              
                Design capacity means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill can accept, as indicated in terms of volume or mass in the most recent permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually.
              
                Disposal facility means all contiguous land and structures, other appurtenances, and improvements on the land used for the disposal of solid waste.
              
                Emission rate cutoff means the threshold annual emission rate to which a landfill compares its estimated emission rate to determine if control under the regulation is required.
              
                Enclosed combustor means an enclosed firebox which maintains a relatively constant limited peak temperature generally using a limited supply of combustion air. An enclosed flare is considered an enclosed combustor.
              
                Flare means an open combustor without enclosure or shroud.
              
                Gas mover equipment means the equipment (i.e., fan, blower, compressor) used to transport landfill gas through the header system.
              
                Gust means the highest instantaneous wind speed that occurs over a 3-second running average.
              
                Household waste means any solid waste (including garbage, trash, and sanitary waste in septic tanks) derived from households (including, but not limited to, single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day-use recreation areas). Household waste does not include fully segregated yard waste. Segregated yard waste means vegetative matter resulting exclusively from the cutting of grass, the pruning and/or removal of bushes, shrubs, and trees, the weeding of gardens, and other landscaping maintenance activities.

                Nondegradable waste means any waste that does not decompose through chemical breakdown or microbiological activity. Examples are, but are not limited to, concrete, municipal waste combustor ash, and metals.
              
                Passive collection system means a gas collection system that solely uses positive pressure within the landfill to move the gas rather than using gas mover equipment.
              
                Root cause analysis means an assessment conducted through a process of investigation to determine the primary cause, and any other contributing causes, of positive pressure at a wellhead.
              
                Segregated yard waste means vegetative matter resulting exclusively from the cutting of grass, the pruning and/or removal of bushes, shrubs, and trees, the weeding of gardens, and other landscaping maintenance activities.
              
                Sludge means the term sludge as defined in 40 CFR 258.2.
              
                Solid waste means the term solid waste as defined in 40 CFR 258.2.

              (a) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams by mass or 2.5 million cubic meters by volume must submit an initial design capacity report to the Administrator as provided in § 60.767(a). The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. Any density conversions must be documented and submitted with the report. Submittal of the initial design capacity report fulfills the requirements of this subpart except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator must submit to the Administrator an amended design capacity report, as provided for in § 60.767(a)(3).
              (2) When an increase in the maximum design capacity of a landfill exempted from the provisions of §§ 60.762(b) through 60.769 on the basis of the design capacity exemption in paragraph (a) of this section results in a revised maximum design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, the owner or operator must comply with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

              (b) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, must either comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this section or calculate an NMOC emission rate for the landfill using the procedures specified in § 60.764. The NMOC emission rate must be recalculated annually, except as provided in § 60.767(b)(1)(ii). The owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters is subject to part 70 or 71 permitting requirements.
              (1) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must:
              (i) Submit an annual NMOC emission rate emission report to the Administrator, except as provided for in § 60.767(b)(1)(ii); and
              (ii) Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the procedures specified in § 60.764(a)(1) until such time as the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, or the landfill is closed.
              (A) If the calculated NMOC emission rate, upon initial calculation or annual recalculation required in paragraph (b) of this section, is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either: Comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this section; calculate NMOC emissions using the next higher tier in § 60.764; or conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the procedures specified in § 60.764(a)(6).
              (B) If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure report must be submitted to the Administrator as provided for in § 60.767(e).
              (2) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year using Tier 1, 2, or 3 procedures, the owner or operator must either:
              (i) Calculated NMOC Emission Rate. Submit a collection and control system design plan prepared by a professional engineer to the Administrator within 1 year as specified in § 60.767(c); calculate NMOC emissions using the next higher tier in § 60.764; or conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the procedures specified in § 60.764(a)(6). The collection and control system must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
              (ii) Collection system. Install and start up a collection and control system that captures the gas generated within the landfill as required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(C) or (D) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section within 30 months after:

              (B) The most recent NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year based on Tier 2, if the Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring shows a surface methane emission concentration of 500 parts per million methane or greater as specified in § 60.767(c)(4)(iii).
              (C) An active collection system must:
              (1) Be designed to handle the maximum expected gas flow rate from the entire area of the landfill that warrants control over the intended use period of the gas control system equipment;
              (2) Collect gas from each area, cell, or group of cells in the landfill in which the initial solid waste has been placed for a period of 5 years or more if active; or 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.
              (3) Collect gas at a sufficient extraction rate;
              (4) Be designed to minimize off-site migration of subsurface gas.

              (A) A non-enclosed flare designed and operated in accordance with the parameters established in § 60.18 except as noted in § 60.764(e); or

              (B) A control system designed and operated to reduce NMOC by 98 weight-percent, or, when an enclosed combustion device is used for control, to either reduce NMOC by 98 weight percent or reduce the outlet NMOC concentration to less than 20 parts per million by volume, dry basis as hexane at 3 percent oxygen. The reduction efficiency or parts per million by volume must be established by an initial performance test to be completed no later than 180 days after the initial startup of the approved control system using the test methods specified in § 60.764(d). The performance test is not required for boilers and process heaters with design heat input capacities equal to or greater than 44 megawatts that burn landfill gas for compliance with this subpart.
              (1) If a boiler or process heater is used as the control device, the landfill gas stream must be introduced into the flame zone.
              (2) The control device must be operated within the parameter ranges established during the initial or most recent performance test. The operating parameters to be monitored are specified in § 60.766;
              (C) Route the collected gas to a treatment system that processes the collected gas for subsequent sale or beneficial use such as fuel for combustion, production of vehicle fuel, production of high-Btu gas for pipeline injection, or use as a raw material in a chemical manufacturing process.

For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter, regardless of when the design capacity report is actually submitted, no later than:
              (1) November 28, 2016 for MSW landfills that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after July 17, 2014 but before August 29, 2016;
              (2) Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction for MSW landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after August 29, 2016.
              (d) When an MSW landfill subject to this subpart is closed as defined in this subpart, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:

              (1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control system under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
              (2) The owner or operator meets the conditions for control system removal specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
            
            
              § 60.763
              Operational standards for collection and control systems.
              Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 60.762(b)(2) must:
              (a) Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid waste has been in place for:
              (1) 5 years or more if active; or
              (2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade;
              (b) Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each wellhead except under the following conditions:
              (1) A fire or increased well temperature. The owner or operator must record instances when positive pressure occurs in efforts to avoid a fire. These records must be submitted with the annual reports as provided in § 60.767(g)(1);
              (2) Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator must develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan;
              (3) A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design changes must be approved by the Administrator as specified in § 60.767(c);

              (c) Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a landfill gas temperature less than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature value at a particular well. A higher operating value demonstration must be submitted to the Administrator for approval and must include supporting data demonstrating that the elevated parameter neither causes fires nor significantly inhibits anaerobic decomposition by killing methanogens. The demonstration must satisfy both criteria in order to be approved (i.e., neither causing fires nor killing methanogens is acceptable).
              (d) Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration is less than 500 parts per million above background at the surface of the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or operator must conduct surface testing using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in § 60.765(d). The owner or operator must conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover and all cover penetrations. Thus, the owner or operator must monitor any openings that are within an area of the landfill where waste has been placed and a gas collection system is required. The owner or operator may establish an alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A surface monitoring design plan must be developed that includes a topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any site-specific deviations from the 30-meter intervals. Areas with steep slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface testing.
              (e) Operate the system such that all collected gases are vented to a control system designed and operated in compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii). In the event the collection or control system is not operating, the gas mover system must be shut down and all valves in the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to the atmosphere must be closed within 1 hour of the collection or control system not operating; and
              (f) Operate the control system at all times when the collected gas is routed to the system.
              (g) If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective action must be taken as specified in § 60.765(a)(3) and (5) or (c). If corrective actions are taken as specified in § 60.765, the monitored exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements in this section.
            
            
              
              § 60.764
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a)(1) NMOC Emission Rate. The landfill owner or operator must calculate the NMOC emission rate using either Equation 1 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or Equation 2 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. Both Equation 1 and Equation 2 may be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, for part of the life of the landfill and the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is unknown, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, for part of the life of the landfill. The values to be used in both Equation 1 and Equation 2 are 0.05 per year for k, 170 cubic meters per megagram for Lo, and 4,000 parts per million by volume as hexane for the CNMOC. For landfills located in geographical areas with a 30-year annual average precipitation of less than 25 inches, as measured at the nearest representative official meteorologic site, the k value to be used is 0.02 per year.
              (i)(A) Equation 1 must be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known.

              (B) The mass of nondegradable solid waste may be subtracted from the total mass of solid waste in a particular section of the landfill when calculating the value for Mi if documentation of the nature and amount of such wastes is maintained.
              (ii)(A) Equation 2 must be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is unknown.

                Where:
                
                MNMOC = Mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year.

                c = Time since closure, years; for active landfill c = 0 and e−kc = 1.
                3.6 × 10−9 = Conversion factor.
              
              
              (B) The mass of nondegradable solid waste may be subtracted from the total mass of solid waste in a particular section of the landfill when calculating the value of R, if documentation of the nature and amount of such wastes is maintained.
              (2) Tier 1. The owner or operator must compare the calculated NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 34 megagrams per year.
              (i) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner or operator must submit an NMOC emission rate report according to § 60.767(b), and must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under § 60.762(b).

              (ii) If the calculated NMOC emission rate as calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner must either:
              (A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 60.767(c) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 60.762(b)(2)(ii) and (iii);
              (B) Determine a site-specific NMOC concentration and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the Tier 2 procedures provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or
              (C) Determine a site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the Tier 3 procedures provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
              (3) Tier 2. The landfill owner or operator must determine the site-specific NMOC concentration using the following sampling procedure. The landfill owner or operator must install at least two sample probes per hectare, evenly distributed over the landfill surface that has retained waste for at least 2 years. If the landfill is larger than 25 hectares in area, only 50 samples are required. The probes should be evenly distributed across the sample area. The sample probes should be located to avoid known areas of nondegradable solid waste. The owner or operator must collect and analyze one sample of landfill gas from each probe to determine the NMOC concentration using Method 25 or 25C of appendix A of this part. Taking composite samples from different probes into a single cylinder is allowed; however, equal sample volumes must be taken from each probe. For each composite, the sampling rate, collection times, beginning and ending cylinder vacuums, or alternative volume measurements must be recorded to verify that composite volumes are equal. Composite sample volumes should not be less than one liter unless evidence can be provided to substantiate the accuracy of smaller volumes. Terminate compositing before the cylinder approaches ambient pressure where measurement accuracy diminishes. If more than the required number of samples are taken, all samples must be used in the analysis. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from Method 25 or 25C of appendix A of this part by six to convert from CNMOC as carbon to CNMOC as hexane. If the landfill has an active or passive gas removal system in place, Method 25 or 25C samples may be collected from these systems instead of surface probes provided the removal system can be shown to provide sampling as representative as the two sampling probe per hectare requirement. For active collection systems, samples may be collected from the common header pipe. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any gas moving, condensate removal, or treatment system equipment. For active collection systems, a minimum of three samples must be collected from the header pipe.
              (i) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 60.8), the owner or operator must submit the results according to § 60.767(i)(1).
              (ii) The landfill owner or operator must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate using Equation 1 or Equation 2 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section and using the average site-specific NMOC concentration from the collected samples instead of the default value provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (iii) If the resulting NMOC mass emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator must submit a periodic estimate of NMOC emissions in an NMOC emission rate report according to § 60.767(b)(1), and must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under § 60.762(b). The site-specific NMOC concentration must be retested every 5 years using the methods specified in this section.
              (iv) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the Tier 2 site-specific NMOC concentration is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the landfill owner or operator must either:

              (A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 60.767(c) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 60.762(b)(2)(ii) and (iii);
              
              (B) Determine a site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the site-specific methane generation rate using the Tier 3 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section; or
              (C) Conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the Tier 4 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
              (4) Tier 3. The site-specific methane generation rate constant must be determined using the procedures provided in Method 2E of appendix A of this part. The landfill owner or operator must estimate the NMOC mass emission rate using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section and using a site-specific methane generation rate constant, and the site-specific NMOC concentration as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section instead of the default values provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The landfill owner or operator must compare the resulting NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 34 megagrams per year.
              (i) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the Tier 2 site-specific NMOC concentration and Tier 3 site-specific methane generation rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either:
              (A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 60.767(c) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 60.762(b)(2)(ii) and (iii); or
              (B) Conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the Tier 4 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
              (ii) If the NMOC mass emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and using the site-specific Tier 2 NMOC concentration and Tier 3 methane generation rate constant and submit a periodic NMOC emission rate report as provided in § 60.767(b)(1). The calculation of the methane generation rate constant is performed only once, and the value obtained from this test must be used in all subsequent annual NMOC emission rate calculations.
              (5) Other methods. The owner or operator may use other methods to determine the NMOC concentration or a site-specific methane generation rate constant as an alternative to the methods required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
              (6) Tier 4. The landfill owner or operator must demonstrate that surface methane emissions are below 500 parts per million. Surface emission monitoring must be conducted on a quarterly basis using the following procedures. Tier 4 is allowed only if the landfill owner or operator can demonstrate that NMOC emissions are greater than or equal to 34 Mg/yr but less than 50 Mg/yr using Tier 1 or Tier 2. If both Tier 1 and Tier 2 indicate NMOC emissions are 50 Mg/yr or greater, then Tier 4 cannot be used. In addition, the landfill must meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(6)(viii) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator must measure surface concentrations of methane along the entire perimeter of the landfill and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in § 60.765(d).
              (ii) The background concentration must be determined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind at least 30 meters from the waste mass boundary of the landfill.
              (iii) Surface emission monitoring must be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that the probe inlet must be placed no more than 5 centimeters above the landfill surface; the constant measurement of distance above the surface should be based on a mechanical device such as with a wheel on a pole, except as described in paragraph (a)(6)(iii)(A) of this section.

              (A) The owner or operator must use a wind barrier, similar to a funnel, when onsite average wind speed exceeds 4 miles per hour or 2 meters per second or gust exceeding 10 miles per hour. Average on-site wind speed must also be determined in an open area at 5-minute intervals using an on-site anemometer with a continuous recorder and data logger for the entire duration of the monitoring event. The wind barrier must surround the SEM monitor, and must be placed on the ground, to ensure wind turbulence is blocked. SEM cannot be conducted if average wind speed exceeds 25 miles per hour.
              (B) Landfill surface areas where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover, and all cover penetrations must also be monitored using a device meeting the specifications provided in § 60.765(d).
              (iv) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the Tier 4 provisions in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must maintain records of surface emission monitoring as provided in § 60.768(g) and submit a Tier 4 surface emissions report as provided in § 60.767(c)(4)(iii).
              (v) If there is any measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year of the first measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill according to § 60.767(c) and install and operate a gas collection and control system according to § 60.762(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) within 30 months of the most recent NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year based on Tier 2.
              (vi) If after four consecutive quarterly monitoring periods at a landfill, other than a closed landfill, there is no measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must continue quarterly surface emission monitoring using the methods specified in this section.
              (vii) If after four consecutive quarterly monitoring periods at a closed landfill there is no measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must conduct annual surface emission monitoring using the methods specified in this section.
              (viii) If a landfill has installed and operates a collection and control system that is not required by this subpart, then the collection and control system must meet the following criteria:
              (A) The gas collection and control system must have operated for 6,570 out of 8,760 hours preceding the Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring demonstration.
              (B) During the Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring demonstration, the gas collection and control system must operate as it normally would to collect and control as much landfill gas as possible.
              (b) After the installation and startup of a collection and control system in compliance with this subpart, the owner or operator must calculate the NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be capped, removed or decommissioned as provided in § 60.762(b)(2)(v), using Equation 3:
              
                ER29AU16.009
              
              
                Where:
                
                MNMOC = Mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year.
                QLFG = Flow rate of landfill gas, cubic meters per minute.
                CNMOC = NMOC concentration, parts per million by volume as hexane.
              
              
              (1) The flow rate of landfill gas, QLFG, must be determined by measuring the total landfill gas flow rate at the common header pipe that leads to the control system using a gas flow measuring device calibrated according to the provisions of section 10 of Method 2E of appendix A of this part.
              
              (2) The average NMOC concentration, CNMOC, must be determined by collecting and analyzing landfill gas sampled from the common header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment using the procedures in Method 25 or Method 25C. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any condensate removal or other gas refining units. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from Method 25 or Method 25C of appendix A of this part by six to convert from CNMOC as carbon to CNMOC as hexane.
              (3) The owner or operator may use another method to determine landfill gas flow rate and NMOC concentration if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
              (i) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 60.8), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test, including any associated fuel analyses, according to § 60.767(i)(1).
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (c) When calculating emissions for Prevention of Significant Deterioration purposes, the owner or operator of each MSW landfill subject to the provisions of this subpart must estimate the NMOC emission rate for comparison to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration major source and significance levels in §§ 51.166 or 52.21 of this chapter using Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Volume I: Stationary Point and Area Sources (AP-42) or other approved measurement procedures.

              (d) For the performance test required in § 60.762(b)(2)(iii)(B), Method 25 or 25C (Method 25C may be used at the inlet only) of appendix A of this part must be used to determine compliance with the 98 weight-percent efficiency or the 20 parts per million by volume outlet concentration level, unless another method to demonstrate compliance has been approved by the Administrator as provided by § 60.767(c)(2). Method 3, 3A, or 3C must be used to determine oxygen for correcting the NMOC concentration as hexane to 3 percent. In cases where the outlet concentration is less than 50 ppm NMOC as carbon (8 ppm NMOC as hexane), Method 25A should be used in place of Method 25. Method 18 may be used in conjunction with Method 25A on a limited basis (compound specific, e.g., methane) or Method 3C may be used to determine methane. The methane as carbon should be subtracted from the Method 25A total hydrocarbon value as carbon to give NMOC concentration as carbon. The landowner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration as carbon by 6 to convert from the CNMOC as carbon to CNMOC as hexane. Equation 4 must be used to calculate efficiency:
              
                ER29AU16.010
              
              
                Where:
                
                NMOCin = Mass of NMOC entering control device.
                NMOCout = Mass of NMOC exiting control device.
              
              (e) For the performance test required in § 60.762(b)(2)(iii)(A), the net heating value of the combusted landfill gas as determined in § 60.18(f)(3) is calculated from the concentration of methane in the landfill gas as measured by Method 3C. A minimum of three 30-minute Method 3C samples are determined. The measurement of other organic components, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide is not applicable. Method 3C may be used to determine the landfill gas molecular weight for calculating the flare gas exit velocity under § 60.18(f)(4).
              (1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 60.8), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, required by § 60.764(b) or (d) according to § 60.767(i)(1).
              (2) [Reserved]
            
            
              § 60.765
              Compliance provisions.

              (a) Except as provided in § 60.767(c)(2), the specified methods in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section must be used to determine whether the gas collection system is in compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(ii).

              (1) For the purposes of calculating the maximum expected gas generation flow rate from the landfill to determine compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(ii)(C)(1), either Equation 5 or Equation 6 must be used. The methane generation rate constant (k) and methane generation potential (Lo) kinetic factors should be those published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42) or other site specific values demonstrated to be appropriate and approved by the Administrator. If k has been determined as specified in § 60.764(a)(4), the value of k determined from the test must be used. A value of no more than 15 years must be used for the intended use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill is the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until closure.
              (i) For sites with unknown year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:
              
                ER29AU16.011
              
              
                Where:
                
                Qm = Maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters per year.
                Lo = Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
                R = Average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year.
                k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
                t = Age of the landfill at equipment installation plus the time the owner or operator intends to use the gas mover equipment or active life of the landfill, whichever is less. If the equipment is installed after closure, t is the age of the landfill at installation, years.

                c = Time since closure, years (for an active landfill c = 0 and e−kc = 1).
              
              
              (ii) For sites with known year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:
              
                ER29AU16.012
              
              
                Where:
                
                QM = Maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters per year.
                k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
                Lo = Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
                Mi = Mass of solid waste in the ith section, megagrams.
                ti = Age of the ith section, years.
              
              
              (iii) If a collection and control system has been installed, actual flow data may be used to project the maximum expected gas generation flow rate instead of, or in conjunction with, Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the landfill is still accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal the maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section or other methods must be used to predict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the intended period of use of the gas control system equipment.

              (2) For the purposes of determining sufficient density of gas collectors for compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(ii)(C)(2), the owner or operator must design a system of vertical wells, horizontal collectors, or other collection devices, satisfactory to the Administrator, capable of controlling and extracting gas from all portions of the landfill sufficient to meet all operational and performance standards.

              (3) For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection system flow rate is sufficient to determine compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(ii)(C)(3), the owner or operator must measure gauge pressure in the gas collection header applied to each individual well, monthly. If a positive pressure exists, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days, except for the three conditions allowed under § 60.763(b). Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.
              (i) If negative pressure cannot be achieved without excess air infiltration within 15 calendar days of the first measurement of positive pressure, the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after positive pressure was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.768(e)(3).
              (ii) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the positive pressure measurement for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the positive pressure measurement. The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 60.767(g)(7) as part of the next annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.768(e)(4).
              (iii) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 60.767(g)(7) and § 60.767(j). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.768(e)(5).
              (4) [Reserved]
              (5) For the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator must monitor each well monthly for temperature as provided in § 60.763(c). If a well exceeds the operating parameter for temperature, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days. Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.
              (i) If a landfill gas temperature less than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) cannot be achieved within 15 calendar days of the first measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit), the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after a landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.768(e)(3).
              (ii) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the positive pressure measurement for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 60.767(g)(7) as part of the next annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.768(e)(4).
              (iii) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 60.767(g)(7) and § 60.767(j). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.768(e)(5).

              (6) An owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(ii)(C)(4) through the use of a collection system not conforming to the specifications provided in § 60.769 must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as specified in § 60.767(c)(3) demonstrating that off-site migration is being controlled.

              (b) For purposes of compliance with § 60.763(a), each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must place each well or design component as specified in the approved design plan as provided in § 60.767(c). Each well must be installed no later than 60 days after the date on which the initial solid waste has been in place for a period of:
              (1) Five (5) years or more if active; or
              (2) Two (2) years or more if closed or at final grade.
              (c) The following procedures must be used for compliance with the surface methane operational standard as provided in § 60.763(d).
              (1) After installation and startup of the gas collection system, the owner or operator must monitor surface concentrations of methane along the entire perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at 30 meter intervals (or a site-specific established spacing) for each collection area on a quarterly basis using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) The background concentration must be determined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind outside the boundary of the landfill at a distance of at least 30 meters from the perimeter wells.
              (3) Surface emission monitoring must be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that the probe inlet must be placed within 5 to 10 centimeters of the ground. Monitoring must be performed during typical meteorological conditions.
              (4) Any reading of 500 parts per million or more above background at any location must be recorded as a monitored exceedance and the actions specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section must be taken. As long as the specified actions are taken, the exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements of § 60.763(d).
              (i) The location of each monitored exceedance must be marked and the location and concentration recorded.
              (ii) Cover maintenance or adjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent wells to increase the gas collection in the vicinity of each exceedance must be made and the location must be re-monitored within 10 calendar days of detecting the exceedance.
              (iii) If the re-monitoring of the location shows a second exceedance, additional corrective action must be taken and the location must be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If the re-monitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section must be taken, and no further monitoring of that location is required until the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section has been taken.
              (iv) Any location that initially showed an exceedance but has a methane concentration less than 500 ppm methane above background at the 10-day re-monitoring specified in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be re-monitored 1 month from the initial exceedance. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows a concentration less than 500 parts per million above background, no further monitoring of that location is required until the next quarterly monitoring period. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows an exceedance, the actions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) or (v) of this section must be taken.
              (v) For any location where monitored methane concentration equals or exceeds 500 parts per million above background three times within a quarterly period, a new well or other collection device must be installed within 120 calendar days of the initial exceedance. An alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading the blower, header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for installation may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
              (5) The owner or operator must implement a program to monitor for cover integrity and implement cover repairs as necessary on a monthly basis.
              (d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section or § 60.764(a)(6) must comply with the following instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission monitoring devices:

              (1) The portable analyzer must meet the instrument specifications provided in section 6 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that “methane” replaces all references to “VOC”.
              
              (2) The calibration gas must be methane, diluted to a nominal concentration of 500 parts per million in air.
              (3) To meet the performance evaluation requirements in section 8.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, the instrument evaluation procedures of section 8.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part must be used.
              (4) The calibration procedures provided in sections 8 and 10 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part must be followed immediately before commencing a surface monitoring survey.
              (e) The provisions of this subpart apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown or malfunction. During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, you must comply with the work practice specified in § 60.763(e) in lieu of the compliance provisions in § 60.765.
            
            
              § 60.766
              Monitoring of operations.
              Except as provided in § 60.767(c)(2):

              (2) Monitor nitrogen or oxygen concentration in the landfill gas on a monthly basis as follows:
              (i) The nitrogen level must be determined using Method 3C, unless an alternative test method is established as allowed by § 60.767(c)(2).
              (ii) Unless an alternative test method is established as allowed by § 60.767(c)(2), the oxygen level must be determined by an oxygen meter using Method 3A, 3C, or ASTM D6522-11 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). Determine the oxygen level by an oxygen meter using Method 3A, 3C, or ASTM D6522-11 (if sample location is prior to combustion) except that:
              (A) The span must be set between 10 and 12 percent oxygen;
              (B) A data recorder is not required;

              (i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the control device at least every 15 minutes; and
              (ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
              (d) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii) using a device other than a non-enclosed flare or an enclosed combustor or a treatment system must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in § 60.767(c)(2) describing the operation of the control device, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator must review the information and either approve it, or request that additional information be submitted. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.
              (e) Each owner or operator seeking to install a collection system that does not meet the specifications in § 60.769 or seeking to monitor alternative parameters to those required by §§ 60.763 through 60.766 must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in § 60.767(c)(2) and (3) describing the design and operation of the collection system, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.
              (f) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with the 500 parts per million surface methane operational standard in § 60.763(d) must monitor surface concentrations of methane according to the procedures in § 60.765(c) and the instrument specifications in § 60.765(d). Any closed landfill that has no monitored exceedances of the operational standard in three consecutive quarterly monitoring periods may skip to annual monitoring. Any methane reading of 500 ppm or more above background detected during the annual monitoring returns the frequency for that landfill to quarterly monitoring.
              (g) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii) using a landfill gas treatment system must maintain and operate all monitoring systems associated with the treatment system in accordance with the site-specific treatment system monitoring plan required in § 60.768(b)(5)(ii) and must calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a device that records flow to the treatment system and bypass of the treatment system (if applicable). The owner or operator must:
              (1) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the treatment system at least every 15 minutes; and
              (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.

              (h) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) (d) and (g) of this section apply at all times the affected source is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
            
            
              § 60.767
              Reporting requirements.
              (a) Design capacity report. Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart must submit an initial design capacity report to the Administrator.
              (1) Submission. The initial design capacity report fulfills the requirements of the notification of the date construction is commenced as required by § 60.7(a)(1) and must be submitted no later than:
              (i) November 28, 2016, for landfills that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after July 17, 2014 but before August 29, 2016; or
              (ii) Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction for landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after August 29, 2016.
              (2) Initial design capacity report. The initial design capacity report must contain the following information:
              (i) A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size and location of the landfill, and identifying all areas where solid waste may be landfilled according to the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill.
              (ii) The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where the maximum design capacity is specified in the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, a copy of the permit specifying the maximum design capacity may be submitted as part of the report. If the maximum design capacity of the landfill is not specified in the permit, the maximum design capacity must be calculated using good engineering practices. The calculations must be provided, along with the relevant parameters as part of the report. The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually. Any density conversions must be documented and submitted with the design capacity report. The state, tribal, local agency or Administrator may request other reasonable information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design capacity of the landfill.
              (3) Amended design capacity report. An amended design capacity report must be submitted to the Administrator providing notification of an increase in the design capacity of the landfill, within 90 days of an increase in the maximum design capacity of the landfill to meet or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. This increase in design capacity may result from an increase in the permitted volume of the landfill or an increase in the density as documented in the annual recalculation required in § 60.768(f).
              (b) NMOC emission rate report. Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart must submit an NMOC emission rate report following the procedure specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section to the Administrator initially and annually thereafter, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported NMOC emission rate.
              (1) The NMOC emission rate report must contain an annual or 5-year estimate of the NMOC emission rate calculated using the formula and procedures provided in § 60.764(a) or (b), as applicable.
              (i) The initial NMOC emission rate report may be combined with the initial design capacity report required in paragraph (a) of this section and must be submitted no later than indicated in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. Subsequent NMOC emission rate reports must be submitted annually thereafter, except as provided for in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

              (A) November 28, 2016, for landfills that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after July 17, 2014, but before August 29, 2016, or
              
              (B) Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction for landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after August 29, 2016.
              (ii) If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual report to the Administrator is less than 34 megagrams per year in each of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to submit, following the procedure specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period in lieu of the annual report. This estimate must include the current amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated waste acceptance rate for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based must be provided to the Administrator. This estimate must be revised at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year estimate, a revised 5-year estimate must be submitted to the Administrator. The revised estimate must cover the 5-year period beginning with the year in which the actual waste acceptance rate exceeded the estimated waste acceptance rate.
              (2) The NMOC emission rate report must include all the data, calculations, sample reports and measurements used to estimate the annual or 5-year emissions.
              (3) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart is exempted from the requirements to submit an NMOC emission rate report, after installing a collection and control system that complies with § 60.762(b)(2), during such time as the collection and control system is in operation and in compliance with §§ 60.763 and 60.765.
              (c) Collection and control system design plan. Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of § 60.762(b)(2) must submit a collection and control system design plan to the Administrator for approval according to the schedule in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The collection and control system design plan must be prepared and approved by a professional engineer and must meet the following requirements:
              (1) The collection and control system as described in the design plan must meet the design requirements in § 60.762(b)(2).
              (2) The collection and control system design plan must include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting provisions of §§ 60.763 through 60.768 proposed by the owner or operator.
              (3) The collection and control system design plan must either conform with specifications for active collection systems in § 60.769 or include a demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction of the sufficiency of the alternative provisions to § 60.769.
              (4) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters must submit a collection and control system design plan to the Administrator for approval within 1 year of the first NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year, except as follows:
              (i) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in § 60.764(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year or the landfill is closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, must be submitted, following the procedures in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 34 megagrams per year.

              (ii) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant k, as provided in Tier 3 in § 60.764(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC emission rate is less than 34 Mg/yr, annual periodic reporting must be resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be used in the emission rate calculation until such time as the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of § 60.764(a)(4) and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, to the Administrator within 1 year of the first calculated emission rate equaling or exceeding 34 megagrams per year.
              (iii) If the owner or operator elects to demonstrate that site-specific surface methane emissions are below 500 parts per million methane, based on the provisions of § 60.764(a)(6), then the owner or operator must submit annually a Tier 4 surface emissions report as specified in this paragraph following the procedure specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section until a surface emissions readings of 500 parts per million methane or greater is found. If the Tier 4 surface emissions report shows no surface emissions readings of 500 parts per million methane or greater for four consecutive quarters at a closed landfill, then the landfill owner or operator may reduce Tier 4 monitoring from a quarterly to an annual frequency. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported instantaneous surface emission readings. The Tier 4 surface emissions report must clearly identify the location, date and time (to nearest second), average wind speeds including wind gusts, and reading (in parts per million) of any value 500 parts per million methane or greater, other than non-repeatable, momentary readings. For location, you must determine the latitude and longitude coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places. The Tier 4 surface emission report must also include the results of the most recent Tier 1 and Tier 2 results in order to verify that the landfill does not exceed 50 Mg/yr of NMOC.
              (A) The initial Tier 4 surface emissions report must be submitted annually, starting within 30 days of completing the fourth quarter of Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring that demonstrates that site-specific surface methane emissions are below 500 parts per million methane, and following the procedure specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
              (B) The Tier 4 surface emissions report must be submitted within 1 year of the first measured surface exceedance of 500 parts per million methane, following the procedure specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
              (5) The landfill owner or operator must notify the Administrator that the design plan is completed and submit a copy of the plan's signature page. The Administrator has 90 days to decide whether the design plan should be submitted for review. If the Administrator chooses to review the plan, the approval process continues as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. However, if the Administrator indicates that submission is not required or does not respond within 90 days, the landfill owner or operator can continue to implement the plan with the recognition that the owner or operator is proceeding at their own risk. In the event that the design plan is required to be modified to obtain approval, the owner or operator must take any steps necessary to conform any prior actions to the approved design plan and any failure to do so could result in an enforcement action.

              (6) Upon receipt of an initial or revised design plan, the Administrator must review the information submitted under paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section and either approve it, disapprove it, or request that additional information be submitted. Because of the many site-specific factors involved with landfill gas system design, alternative systems may be necessary. A wide variety of system designs are possible, such as vertical wells, combination horizontal and vertical collection systems, or horizontal trenches only, leachate collection components, and passive systems. If the Administrator does not approve or disapprove the design plan, or does not request that additional information be submitted within 90 days of receipt, then the owner or operator may continue with implementation of the design plan, recognizing they would be proceeding at their own risk.
              (7) If the owner or operator chooses to demonstrate compliance with the emission control requirements of this subpart using a treatment system as defined in this subpart, then the owner or operator must prepare a site-specific treatment system monitoring plan as specified in § 60.768(b)(5).
              (d) Revised design plan. The owner or operator who has already been required to submit a design plan under paragraph (c) of this section must submit a revised design plan to the Administrator for approval as follows:
              (1) At least 90 days before expanding operations to an area not covered by the previously approved design plan.
              (2) Prior to installing or expanding the gas collection system in a way that is not consistent with the design plan that was submitted to the Administrator according to paragraph (c) of this section.
              (e) Closure report. Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must submit a closure report to the Administrator within 30 days of waste acceptance cessation. The Administrator may request additional information as may be necessary to verify that permanent closure has taken place in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 258.60. If a closure report has been submitted to the Administrator, no additional wastes may be placed into the landfill without filing a notification of modification as described under § 60.7(a)(4).
              (f) Equipment removal report. Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must submit an equipment removal report to the Administrator 30 days prior to removal or cessation of operation of the control equipment.
              (1) The equipment removal report must contain all of the following items:
              (i) A copy of the closure report submitted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;
              (ii) A copy of the initial performance test report demonstrating that the 15-year minimum control period has expired, unless the report of the results of the performance test has been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX, or information that demonstrates that the GCCS will be unable to operate for 15 years due to declining gas flows. In the equipment removal report, the process unit(s) tested, the pollutant(s) tested, and the date that such performance test was conducted may be submitted in lieu of the performance test report if the report has been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX; and
              (iii) Dated copies of three successive NMOC emission rate reports demonstrating that the landfill is no longer producing 34 megagrams or greater of NMOC per year, unless the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX. If the NMOC emission rate reports have been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX, a statement that the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted electronically and the dates that the reports were submitted to the EPA's CDX may be submitted in the equipment removal report in lieu of the NMOC emission rate reports.
              (2) The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify that all of the conditions for removal in § 60.762(b)(2)(v) have been met.
              (g) Annual report. The owner or operator of a landfill seeking to comply with § 60.762(b)(2) using an active collection system designed in accordance with § 60.762(b)(2)(ii) must submit to the Administrator, following the procedure specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, annual reports of the recorded information in paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section. The initial annual report must be submitted within 180 days of installation and startup of the collection and control system, and must include the initial performance test report required under § 60.8, as applicable, unless the report of the results of the performance test has been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX. In the initial annual report, the process unit(s) tested, the pollutant(s) tested, and the date that such performance test was conducted may be submitted in lieu of the performance test report if the report has been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX.

              § 60.769
              Specifications for active collection systems.
              (a) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.762(b)(2)(i) must site active collection wells, horizontal collectors, surface collectors, or other extraction devices at a sufficient density throughout all gas producing areas using the following procedures unless alternative procedures have been approved by the Administrator as provided in § 60.767(c)(2) and (3):

              (1) The collection devices within the interior must be certified to achieve comprehensive control of surface gas emissions by a professional engineer. The following issues must be addressed in the design: Depths of refuse, refuse gas generation rates and flow characteristics, cover properties, gas system expandability, leachate and condensate management, accessibility, compatibility with filling operations, integration with closure end use, air intrusion control, corrosion resistance, fill settlement, resistance to the refuse decomposition heat, and ability to isolate individual components or sections for repair or troubleshooting without shutting down entire collection system.
              (2) The sufficient density of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must address landfill gas migration issues and augmentation of the collection system through the use of active or passive systems at the landfill perimeter or exterior.
              (3) The placement of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must control all gas producing areas, except as provided by paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) Any segregated area of asbestos or nondegradable material may be excluded from collection if documented as provided under § 60.768(d). The documentation must provide the nature, date of deposition, location and amount of asbestos or nondegradable material deposited in the area, and must be provided to the Administrator upon request.
              (ii) Any nonproductive area of the landfill may be excluded from control, provided that the total of all excluded areas can be shown to contribute less than 1 percent of the total amount of NMOC emissions from the landfill. The amount, location, and age of the material must be documented and provided to the Administrator upon request. A separate NMOC emissions estimate must be made for each section proposed for exclusion, and the sum of all such sections must be compared to the NMOC emissions estimate for the entire landfill.
              (A) The NMOC emissions from each section proposed for exclusion must be computed using Equation 7:
              
                ER29AU16.013
              
              
                Where:
                
                Qi = NMOC emission rate from the ith section, megagrams per year.
                k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
                Lo = Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
                Mi = Mass of the degradable solid waste in the ith section, megagram.
                ti = Age of the solid waste in the ith section, years.
                CNMOC = Concentration of nonmethane organic compounds, parts per million by volume.
                3.6 × 10−9 = Conversion factor.
              
              

              (B) If the owner/operator is proposing to exclude, or cease gas collection and control from, nonproductive physically separated (e.g., separately lined) closed areas that already have gas collection systems, NMOC emissions from each physically separated closed area must be computed using either Equation 3 in § 60.764(b) or Equation 7 in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
              (iii) The values for k and CNMOC determined in field testing must be used if field testing has been performed in determining the NMOC emission rate or the radii of influence (this distance from the well center to a point in the landfill where the pressure gradient applied by the blower or compressor approaches zero). If field testing has not been performed, the default values for k, Lo and CNMOC provided in § 60.764(a)(1) or the alternative values from § 60.764(a)(5) must be used. The mass of nondegradable solid waste contained within the given section may be subtracted from the total mass of the section when estimating emissions provided the nature, location, age, and amount of the nondegradable material is documented as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
              (b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.762(b)(2)(ii)(A) construct the gas collection devices using the following equipment or procedures:

              (1) The landfill gas extraction components must be constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous corrosion resistant material of suitable dimensions to: Convey projected amounts of gases; withstand installation, static, and settlement forces; and withstand planned overburden or traffic loads. The collection system must extend as necessary to comply with emission and migration standards. Collection devices such as wells and horizontal collectors must be perforated to allow gas entry without head loss sufficient to impair performance across the intended extent of control. Perforations must be situated with regard to the need to prevent excessive air infiltration.
              (2) Vertical wells must be placed so as not to endanger underlying liners and must address the occurrence of water within the landfill. Holes and trenches constructed for piped wells and horizontal collectors must be of sufficient cross-section so as to allow for their proper construction and completion including, for example, centering of pipes and placement of gravel backfill. Collection devices must be designed so as not to allow indirect short circuiting of air into the cover or refuse into the collection system or gas into the air. Any gravel used around pipe perforations should be of a dimension so as not to penetrate or block perforations.
              (3) Collection devices may be connected to the collection header pipes below or above the landfill surface. The connector assembly must include a positive closing throttle valve, any necessary seals and couplings, access couplings and at least one sampling port. The collection devices must be constructed of PVC, HDPE, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous material of suitable thickness.
              (c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii) must convey the landfill gas to a control system in compliance with § 60.762(b)(2)(iii) through the collection header pipe(s). The gas mover equipment must be sized to handle the maximum gas generation flow rate expected over the intended use period of the gas moving equipment using the following procedures:
              (1) For existing collection systems, the flow data must be used to project the maximum flow rate. If no flow data exists, the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be used.
              (2) For new collection systems, the maximum flow rate must be in accordance with § 60.765(a)(1).

                § 60.1045
                Are there different subcategories of small municipal waste combustion units within this subpart?
                (a) Yes, this subpart subcategorizes small municipal waste combustion units into two groups based on the aggregate capacity of the municipal waste combustion plant as follows:
                (1) Class I Units. Class I units are small municipal waste combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants with an aggregate plant combustion capacity greater than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of “municipal waste combustion plant capacity” in § 60.1465 for specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)
                (2) Class II Units. Class II units are small municipal waste combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants with an aggregate plant combustion capacity less than or equal to 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of “municipal waste combustion plant capacity” in § 60.1465 for specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)

              Good Combustion Practices: Operator Certification
              
                § 60.1185
                What types of operator certification must the chief facility operator and shift supervisor obtain and by when must they obtain it?
                (a) Each chief facility operator and shift supervisor must obtain and keep a current provisional operator certification from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (QRO-1-1994) (incorporated by reference in § 60.17(h)(1)) or a current provisional operator certification from your State certification program.
                (b) Each chief facility operator and shift supervisor must obtain a provisional certification by the later of three dates:
                (1) Six months after the municipal waste combustion unit initial startup.
                (2) December 6, 2001.
                (3) Six months after they transfer to the municipal waste combustion unit or 6 months after they are hired to work at the municipal waste combustion unit.
                (c) Each chief facility operator and shift supervisor must take one of three actions:
                (1) Obtain a full certification from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers or a State certification program in your State.
                (2) Schedule a full certification exam with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (QRO-1-1994) (incorporated by reference in § 60.17(h)(1)).
                (3) Schedule a full certification exam with your State certification program.
                (d) The chief facility operator and shift supervisor must obtain the full certification or be scheduled to take the certification exam by the later of three dates:
                (1) Six months after the municipal waste combustion unit initial startup.
                (2) December 6, 2001.
                (3) Six months after they transfer to the municipal waste combustion unit or 6 months after they are hired to work at the municipal waste combustion unit.
              
              
                § 60.1190
                After the required date for operator certification, who may operate the municipal waste combustion unit?
                After the required date for full or provisional certifications, you must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit unless one of four employees is on duty:
                (a) A fully certified chief facility operator.
                (b) A provisionally certified chief facility operator who is scheduled to take the full certification exam.
                (c) A fully certified shift supervisor.
                (d) A provisionally certified shift supervisor who is scheduled to take the full certification exam.
              
              
                § 60.1195
                What if all the certified operators must be temporarily offsite?
                If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor both are unavailable, a provisionally certified control room operator at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are away, you must meet one of three criteria:
                (a) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are both offsite for 12 hours or less, and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator.
                (b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the period when the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite and include that information in the annual report as specified under § 60.1410(l).

                (c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks, and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, you must take two actions:
                (1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.
                (2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may continue.

              Continuous Emission Monitoring
              
                § 60.1225
                What types of continuous emission monitoring must I perform?
                To continuously monitor emissions, you must perform four tasks:
                (a) Install continuous emission monitoring systems for certain gaseous pollutants.
                (b) Make sure your continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly.
                (c) Make sure you obtain the minimum amount of monitoring data.
                (d) Install a continuous opacity monitoring system.
              
              
                § 60.1230
                What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install for gaseous pollutants?
                (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous emission monitoring systems for oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, you must also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system for nitrogen oxides. Install the continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the outlet of the air pollution control device.
                (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission monitoring system according to the “Monitoring Requirements” in § 60.13.
                (c) You must monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at each location where you monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Additionally, if you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, you must also monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at the location where you monitor nitrogen oxides.
                (d) You may choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a diluent gas. If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide, then an oxygen monitor is not required, and you must follow the requirements in § 60.1255.
                (e) If you choose to demonstrate compliance by monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, you must also install continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the inlet of the air pollution control device.

                (f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at the inlet of the air pollution control device to determine percent reduction, you can apply to the Administrator for approval to use an alternative monitoring method under § 60.13(i).
              
              
                § 60.1235
                How are the data from the continuous emission monitoring systems used?
                You must use data from the continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits specified in tables 1 and 2 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash, see § 60.1290.
              
              
                § 60.1240
                How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly?
                (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
                (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission monitoring systems within 60 days after your municipal waste combustion unit reaches the maximum load level at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after its initial startup.
                (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently (or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in table 3 of this subpart. Collect the data during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications in appendix B of this part. table 4 of this subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each continuous emission monitoring system.
                (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy determinations.
              
              
                § 60.1245
                Am I exempt from any appendix B or appendix F requirements to evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?
                Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from two requirements:
                (a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of this part (relative accuracy requirement).
                (b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of this part (relative accuracy test audit).
              
              
                § 60.1250
                What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission monitoring systems?
                (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation was conducted.
                (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.
              
              
                § 60.1255
                What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a diluent gas?
                You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems. You may reestablish the relationship during annual evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
                (a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in appendix A of this part to determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon dioxide monitor.
                (b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 30 minutes in each hour.
                (c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B in appendix A of this part to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide.
              
              
                
                § 60.1260
                What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is the data collection requirement enforceable?
                (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level). Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen (or carbon dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level).
                (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute period.
                (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
                (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must notify the Administrator according to § 60.1410(e).
                (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with § 60.1265.
              
              
                § 60.1265
                How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into the appropriate averaging times and units?
                (a) Use the equation in § 60.1460(a) to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen.
                (b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of sulfur dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 5.4, to determine the daily geometric average percent reduction of potential sulfur dioxide emissions.
                (c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.1, to calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen oxides.
                (d) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.
              
              
                § 60.1270
                What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring system and how are the data used?
                (a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system.
                (b) Install, evaluate, and operate each continuous opacity monitoring system according to § 60.13.
                (c) Complete an initial evaluation of your continuous opacity monitoring system according to Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of this part. Complete the evaluation within 60 days after your municipal waste combustion unit reaches the maximum load level at which it will operate, but no more than 180 days after its initial startup.
                (d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
                (e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9 in appendix A of this part, as specified in § 60.1300, to determine compliance with the opacity limit in table 1 of this subpart. The data obtained from your continuous opacity monitoring system are not used to determine compliance with the opacity limit.
              
              
                § 60.1275

                § 60.1290
                How are the stack test data used?
                You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits in table 1 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see § 60.1235.
              
              
                § 60.1295
                What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?

                (b) Conduct annual stack tests for the same pollutants after the initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack test no later than 13 months after the previous stack test.
              
              
                § 60.1300
                What test methods must I use to stack test?
                (a) Follow table 5 of this subpart to establish the sampling location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements for the different pollutants.
                (b) Make sure that stack tests for all the pollutants consist of at least three test runs, as specified in § 60.8. Use the average of the pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to determine compliance with the emission limits in table 1 of this subpart.
                (c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as specified in § 60.1230.
                (d) Use the equations in § 60.1460(a) to calculate emission levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test methods in table 5 of this subpart for other required equations.
                (e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under § 60.8(b) to use a reference method with minor changes in methodology, use an equivalent method, use an alternative method the results of which the Administrator has determined are adequate for demonstrating compliance, waive the requirement for a performance test because you have demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance, or use a shorter sampling time or smaller sampling volume.
              
              
                § 60.1305
                May I conduct stack testing less often?

                (a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission limit. In that case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every 3rd year but no later than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years show compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant. The provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
                (b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that are subject to this subpart. Second, all those municipal waste combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for 2 consecutive years. In that case, you may choose to conduct annual stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit per year at your plant. The provision only applies to stack testing for dioxins/furans emissions.
                (1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by the Administrator.
                (2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), you may continue stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year.
                (3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans emissions greater than 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), conduct subsequent annual stack tests on all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans emission levels less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for all municipal waste combustion units at your plant subject to this subpart for 2 consecutive years.
              
              
                § 60.1310
                May I deviate from the 13-month testing schedule if unforeseen circumstances arise?
                You may not deviate from the 13-month testing schedules specified in §§ 60.1295(b) and 60.1305(b)(1) unless you apply to the Administrator for an alternative schedule, and the Administrator approves your request for alternate scheduling prior to the date on which you would otherwise have been required to conduct the next stack test.
              
            
            
              Other Monitoring Requirements
              
                § 60.1315
                Must I meet other requirements for continuous monitoring?
                You must also monitor three operating parameters:
                (a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit.
                (b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate matter air pollution control device.
                (c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions.
              
              
                § 60.1320
                How do I monitor the load of my municipal waste combustion unit?
                (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit generates steam, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a steam flowmeter or a feed water flowmeter and meet five requirements:
                (1) Continuously measure and record the measurements of steam (or feed water) in kilograms (or pounds) per hour.
                (2) Calculate your steam (or feed water) flow in 4-hour block averages.
                (3) Calculate the steam (or feed water) flow rate using the method in “American Society of Mechanical Engineers Power Test Codes: Test Code for Steam Generating Units, Power Test Code 4.1—1964 (R1991),” section 4 (incorporated by reference in § 60.17(h)(2)).

                (4) Design, construct, install, calibrate, and use nozzles or orifices for flow rate measurements, using the recommendations in “American Society of Mechanical Engineers Interim Supplement 19.5 on Instruments and Apparatus: Application, part II of Fluid Meters,” 6th Edition (1971), chapter 4 (incorporated by reference in § 60.17(h)(3)).
                (5) Before each dioxins/furans stack test, or at least once a year, calibrate all signal conversion elements associated with steam (or feed water) flow measurements according to the manufacturer instructions.
                (b) If your municipal waste combustion unit does not generate steam, or, if your municipal waste combustion units have shared steam systems and steam load cannot be estimated per unit, you must determine, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, one or more operating parameters that can be used to continuously estimate load level (for example, the feed rate of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel). You must continuously monitor the selected parameters.
              
              
                § 60.1325
                How do I monitor the temperature of flue gases at the inlet of my particulate matter control device?
                You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to continuously measure the temperature of the flue gas stream at the inlet of each particulate matter control device.
              
              
                § 60.1330
                How do I monitor the injection rate of activated carbon?
                If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must meet three requirements:
                (a) Select a carbon injection system operating parameter that can be used to calculate carbon feed rate (for example, screw feeder speed).
                (b) During each dioxins/furans and mercury stack test, determine the average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. Also, determine the average operating parameter level that correlates to the carbon feed rate. Establish a relationship between the operating parameter and the carbon feed rate in order to calculate the carbon feed rate based on the operating parameter level.
                (c) Continuously monitor the selected operating parameter during all periods when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating and combusting waste, and calculate the 8-hour block average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour, based on the selected operating parameter. When calculating the 8-hour block average, do two things:
                (1) Exclude hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is not operating.
                (2) Include hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating but the carbon feed system is not working correctly.
              
              
                § 60.1335
                What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect with my continuous parameter monitoring systems and is the data collection requirement enforceable?
                (a) Where continuous parameter monitoring systems are used, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages for three parameters:
                (1) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit.
                (2) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of your particulate matter control device.
                (3) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions.
                (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average.
                (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
                (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection requirement and you must notify the Administrator according to § 60.1410(e).

                § 60.1460
                What equations must I use?
                (a) Concentration correction to 7 percent oxygen. Correct any pollutant concentration to 7 percent oxygen using equation 1 of this section:
                
                C7
                  % = Cunc * (13.9) * (1/(20.9−CO2)) (Eq.1)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  C7
                    % = concentration corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
                  Cunc = uncorrected pollutant concentration.
                  CO2 = concentration of oxygen (percent).
                
                
                (b) Percent reduction in potential mercury emissions. Calculate the percent reduction in potential mercury emissions (%PHg) using equation 2 of this section:
                
                %PHg = (Ei−o) * (100/Ei) (Eq. 2)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  %PHg = percent reduction of potential mercury emissions
                  Ei = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry basis
                  Eo = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry basis

                  Where:
                  
                  %PHC1 = percent reduction of the potential hydrogen chloride emissions
                  EI = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at the air pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry basis

                (d) Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit. For a municipal waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the municipal waste combustion unit capacity based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:
                (1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:

                (i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).
                
                (ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).
                (2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
                (e) Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
                (f) Quarterly carbon usage. If you use activated carbon to comply with the dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required quarterly usage of carbon using equation 4 of this section for plant basis or equation 5 of this section for unit basis:
                (1) Plant basis.

                This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance schedules for the control of emissions from existing small municipal waste combustion units. The pollutants addressed by the emission guidelines are listed in tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. The emission guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 129 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and subpart B of this part.
              
              
                § 60.1505
                Am I affected by this subpart?
                (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a State or United States protectorate with one or more existing small municipal waste combustion units that commenced construction on or before August 30, 1999, you must submit a State plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (b) You must submit the State plan to EPA by December 6, 2001.
              
              
                § 60.1510
                Is a State plan required for all States?
                No, you are not required to submit a State plan if there are no existing small municipal waste combustion units in your State and you submit a negative declaration letter in place of the State plan.
              
              
                § 60.1515
                What must I include in my State plan?
                (a) Include nine items:
                (1) Inventory of affected municipal waste combustion units, including those that have ceased operation but have not been dismantled.
                (2) Inventory of emissions from affected municipal waste combustion units in your State.
                (3) Compliance schedules for each affected municipal waste combustion unit.
                (4) Good combustion practices and emission limits for affected municipal waste ombustion units that are at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (5) Stack testing, continuous emission monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
                (6) Certification that the hearing on the State plan was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.
                (7) Provision for State progress reports to EPA.
                (8) Identification of enforceable State mechanisms that you selected for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart.
                (9) Demonstration of your State's legal authority to carry out the CAA sections 111(d) and 129 State plan.
                (b) Your State plan can deviate from the format and content of the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. However, if your State plan does deviate, you must demonstrate that your State plan is as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Your State plan must address regulatory applicability, increments of progress for retrofit, operator training and certification, operating practice, emission limits, continuous emission monitoring, stack testing, recordkeeping, reporting, and air curtain incinerator requirements.
                (c) Follow the requirements of subpart B of this part in your State plan.
              
              
                § 60.1520
                Is there an approval process for my State plan?
                The EPA will review your State plan according to § 60.27.
              
              
                § 60.1525
                What if my State plan is not approvable?
                If you do not submit an approvable State plan (or a negative declaration letter), EPA will develop a Federal plan, according to § 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of municipal waste combustion units not covered by an approved and currently effective State plan must comply with the Federal plan. The Federal plan is an interim action and, by its own terms, will cease to apply when your State plan is approved and becomes effective.
              
              
                § 60.1530
                Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?

                No, the EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, EPA will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the Federal Register. If, at a later date, an existing small municipal waste combustion unit is identified in your State, the Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart will automatically apply to that municipal waste combustion unit until your State plan is approved.
              
              
                § 60.1535
                What compliance schedule must I include in my State plan?
                (a) Your State plan must include compliance schedules that require small municipal waste combustion units to achieve final compliance or cease operation as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the earlier of two dates:
                (1) December 6, 2005.
                (2) Three years after the effective date of State plan approval.
                (b) For compliance schedules longer than 1 year after the effective date of State plan approval, State plans must include two items:
                (1) Dates for enforceable increments of progress as specified in § 60.1590.
                (2) For Class I units (see definition in § 60.1940), dioxins/furans stack test results for at least one test conducted during or after 1990. The stack tests must have been conducted according to the procedures specified under § 60.1790.
                (c) Class I units that commenced construction after June 26, 1987 must comply with the dioxins/furans and mercury limits specified in tables 2 and 3 of this subpart by the later of two dates:
                (1) One year after the effective date of State plan approval.
                (2) One year following the issuance of a revised construction or operation permit, if a permit modification is required.
              
              
                § 60.1540
                Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart that supersede the requirements specified in subpart B?
                Subpart B of this part establishes general requirements for developing and processing CAA section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part, for two items:
                (a) Option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules. State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State plans must require all municipal waste combustion units to comply no later than December 6, 2005. That requirement applies instead of the option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in § 60.24(f).
                (b) Increments of progress requirements. For Class II units (see definition in § 60.1940), a State plan must include at least two increments of progress for the affected municipal waste combustion units. The two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal date and final compliance date in § 60.21(h)(1) and (5). That requirement applies instead of the requirement of § 60.24(e)(1) that would require a State plan to include all five increments of progress for all municipal waste combustion units. For Class I units under this subpart, the final control plan must contain the five increments of progress in § 60.24(e)(1).
              
              
                § 60.1545
                Does this subpart directly affect municipal waste combustion unit owners and operators in my State?
                (a) No, this subpart does not directly affect municipal waste combustion unit owners and operators in your State. However, municipal waste combustion unit owners and operators must comply with the State plan you developed to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Some States may incorporate the emission guidelines contained in this subpart into their State plans by direct incorporation by reference. Others may include the model rule text directly in their State plan.
                (b) All municipal waste combustion units must be in compliance with the requirements established in this subpart by December 6, 2005, whether the municipal waste combustion unit is regulated under a State or Federal plan.
              
            
            
              Applicability of State Plans
              
                § 60.1550
                What municipal waste combustion units must I address in my State plan?

                (a) Your State plan must address all existing small municipal waste combustion units in your State that meet two criteria:
                
                (1) The municipal waste combustion unit has the capacity to combust at least 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste but no more than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
                (2) The municipal waste combustion unit commenced construction on or before August 30, 1999.
                (b) If an owner or operator of a municipal waste combustion unit makes changes that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction after June 6, 2001 for subpart AAAA of this part, the municipal waste combustion unit becomes subject to subpart AAAA of this part and the State plan no longer applies to that unit.
                (c) If an owner or operator of a municipal waste combustion unit makes physical or operational changes to an existing municipal waste combustion unit primarily to comply with your State plan, subpart AAAA of this part (New Source Performance Standards for New Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units) does not apply to that unit. Such changes do not constitute modifications or reconstructions under subpart AAAA of this part.
              
              
                § 60.1555
                Are any small municipal waste combustion units exempt from my State plan?
                (a) Small municipal waste combustion units that combust less than 11 tons per day. Units are exempt from your State plan if four requirements are met:
                (1) The municipal waste combustion unit is subject to a federally enforceable permit limiting the amount of municipal solid waste combusted to less than 11 tons per day.
                (2) You are notified by the owner or operator that the unit qualifies for the exemption.
                (3) You receive from the owner or operator of the unit a copy of the federally enforceable permit.
                (4) The owner or operator of the unit keeps daily records of the amount of municipal solid waste combusted.

                (4) You receive documentation from the owner or operator that the unit qualifies for the exemption.
                (d) Municipal waste combustion units that combust only tires. Units are exempt from your State plan if three requirements are met:
                (1) The municipal waste combustion unit combusts a single-item waste stream of tires and no other municipal waste (the unit can co-fire coal, fuel oil, natural gas, or other nonmunicipal solid waste).
                (2) You are notified by the owner or operator that the unit qualifies for the exemption.
                (3) You receive documentation from the owner or operator that the unit qualifies for the exemption.
                (e) Hazardous waste combustion units. Units are exempt from your State plan if the units have received a permit under section 3005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
                (f) Materials recovery units. Units are exempt from your State plan if the units combust waste mainly to recover metals. Primary and secondary smelters may qualify for the exemption.
                (g) Co-fired units. Units are exempt from your State plan if four requirements are met:

                (1) The unit has a federally enforceable permit limiting municipal solid waste combustion to 30 percent of the total fuel input by weight.
                (2) You are notified by the owner or operator that the unit qualifies for the exemption.
                (3) You receive from the owner or operator of the unit a copy of the federally enforceable permit.
                (4) The owner or operator records the weights, each quarter, of municipal solid waste and of all other fuels combusted.
                (h) Plastics/rubber recycling units. Units are exempt from your State plan if four requirements are met:

                (j) Cement kilns. Cement kilns that combust municipal solid waste are exempt from your State plan.
                (k) Air curtain incinerators. If an air curtain incinerator (see § 60.1940 for definition) combusts 100 percent yard waste, then those units must only meet the requirements under “Model Rule—Air Curtain Incinerators That Burn 100 Percent Yard Waste” (§§ 60.1910 through 60.1930).
              
              
                § 60.1560
                Can an affected municipal waste combustion unit reduce its capacity to less than 35 tons per day rather than comply with my State plan?
                (a) Yes, an owner or operator of an affected municipal waste combustion unit may choose to reduce, by your final compliance date, the maximum combustion capacity of the unit to less than 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste rather than comply with your State plan. They must submit a final control plan and the notifications of achievement of increments of progress as specified in § 60.1610.
                (b) The final control plan must, at a minimum, include two items:
                (1) A description of the physical changes that will be made to accomplish the reduction.
                (2) Calculations of the current maximum combustion capacity and the planned maximum combustion capacity after the reduction. Use the equations specified under § 60.1935(d) and (e) to calculate the combustion capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit.
                (c) A permit restriction or a change in the method of operation does not qualify as a reduction in capacity. Use the equations specified under § 60.1935(d) and (e) to calculate the combustion capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit.
              
              
                § 60.1565
                What subcategories of small municipal waste combustion units must I include in my State plan?
                This subpart specifies different requirements for different subcategories of municipal waste combustion units. You must use those same two subcategories in your State plan. Those two subcategories are based on the aggregate capacity of the municipal waste combustion plant as follows:
                (a) Class I units. Class I units are small municipal waste combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants with an aggregate plant combustion capacity greater than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of “municipal waste combustion plant capacity” in § 60.1940 for specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)
                
                (b) Class II units. Class II units are small municipal waste combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants with an aggregate plant combustion capacity less than or equal to 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of “municipal waste combustion plant capacity” in § 60.1940 for specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)
              
            
            
              Use of Model Rule
              
                § 60.1570
                What is the “model rule” in this subpart?
                (a) The model rule is the portion of the emission guidelines (§§ 60.1585 through 60.1905) that addresses the regulatory requirements applicable to small municipal waste combustion units. The model rule provides the requirements in a regulation format.
                (b) In the model rule, “you” means the owner or operator of a small municipal waste combustion unit.
              
              
                § 60.1575
                How does the model rule relate to the required elements of my State plan?
                The model rule may be used to satisfy the State plan requirements specified in § 60.1515(a)(4) and (5). Alternative language may be used in your State plan, but only if you can demonstrate that the alternative language is as protective as the model rule.
              
              
                § 60.1580
                What are the principal components of the model rule?
                The model rule contains five major components:
                (a) Increments of progress toward compliance.
                (b) Good combustion practices:
                (1) Operator training.
                (2) Operator certification.
                (3) Operating requirements.
                (c) Emission limits.
                (d) Monitoring and stack testing.
                (e) Recordkeeping and reporting.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Increments of Progress
              
                § 60.1585
                What are my requirements for meeting increments of progress and achieving final compliance?
                (a) Class I units. If you plan to achieve compliance more than 1 year following the effective date of State plan approval and a permit modification is not required, or more than 1 year following the date of issuance of a revised construction or operation permit if a permit modification is required, you must meet five increments of progress:
                (1) Submit a final control plan.
                (2) Submit a notification of retrofit contract award.
                (3) Initiate onsite construction.
                (4) Complete onsite construction.
                (5) Achieve final compliance.
                (b) Class II units. If you plan to achieve compliance more than 1 year following the effective date of State plan approval and a permit modification is not required, or more than 1 year following the date of issuance of a revised construction or operation permit if a permit modification is required, you must meet two increments of progress:
                (1) Submit a final control plan.
                (2) Achieve final compliance.
              
              
                § 60.1590
                When must I complete each increment of progress?

                Table 1 of this subpart specifies compliance dates for each of the increments of progress for Class I and II units. (See § 60.1940 for definitions of classes.)
              
              
                § 60.1595
                What must I include in the notifications of achievement of my increments of progress?
                Your notification of achievement of increments of progress must include three items:
                (a) Notification that the increment of progress has been achieved.
                (b) Any items required to be submitted with the increment of progress (§§ 60.1610 through 60.1630).
                (c) The notification must be signed by the owner or operator of the municipal waste combustion unit.
              
              
                § 60.1600
                When must I submit the notifications of achievement of increments of progress?
                Notifications of the achievement of increments of progress must be postmarked no later than 10 days after the compliance date for the increment.
              
              
                
                § 60.1605
                What if I do not meet an increment of progress?
                If you fail to meet an increment of progress, you must submit a notification to the Administrator postmarked within 10 business days after the specified date in table 1 of this subpart for achieving that increment of progress. The notification must inform the Administrator that you did not meet the increment. You must include in the notification an explanation of why the increment of progress was not met and your plan for meeting the increment as expeditiously as possible. You must continue to submit reports each subsequent month until the increment of progress is met.
              
              
                § 60.1610
                How do I comply with the increment of progress for submittal of a control plan?
                For your control plan increment of progress, you must complete two items:
                (a) Submit the final control plan, including a description of the devices for air pollution control and process changes that you will use to comply with the emission limits and other requirements of this subpart.
                (b) You must maintain an onsite copy of the final control plan.
              
              
                § 60.1615
                How do I comply with the increment of progress for awarding contracts?
                You must submit a signed copy of the contracts awarded to initiate onsite construction, initiate onsite installation of emission control equipment, and incorporate process changes.

                What if all the certified operators must be temporarily offsite?

                If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor both are unavailable, a provisionally certified control room operator at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are away, you must meet one of three criteria:
                (a) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are both offsite for 12 hours or less and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator.
                (b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the periods when the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite and include the information in the annual report as specified under § 60.1885(l).
                (c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks, and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, you must take two actions:
                (1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.
                (2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may continue.

                § 60.1715
                What types of continuous emission monitoring must I perform?
                To continuously monitor emissions, you must perform four tasks:

                (a) Install continuous emission monitoring systems for certain gaseous pollutants.
                
                (b) Make sure your continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly.
                (c) Make sure you obtain the minimum amount of monitoring data.
                (d) Install a continuous opacity monitoring system.
              
              
                § 60.1720
                What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install for gaseous pollutants?
                (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous emission monitoring systems for oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system for nitrogen oxides. Install the continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the outlet of the air pollution control device.
                (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission monitoring system according to the “Monitoring Requirements” in § 60.13.
                (c) You must monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at each location where you monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Additionally, if you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, you must also monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at the location where you monitor nitrogen oxides.
                (d) You may choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a diluent gas. If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide, then an oxygen monitor is not required and you must follow the requirements in § 60.1745.
                (e) If you choose to demonstrate compliance by monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, you must also install continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the inlet of the air pollution control device.
                (f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at the inlet of the air pollution control device to determine percent reduction, you can apply to the Administrator for approval to use an alternative monitoring method under § 60.13(i).
              
              
                § 60.1725

                (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
                (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date.
                (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently (or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in table 6 of this subpart. Collect the data during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications in appendix B of this part. table 7 of this subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each continuous emission monitoring system.
                (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy determinations.
              
              
                
                § 60.1735
                Am I exempt from any appendix B or appendix F requirements to evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?
                Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from two requirements:
                (a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of this part (relative accuracy requirement).
                (b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of this part (relative accuracy test audit).
              
              
                § 60.1740
                What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission monitoring systems?
                (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation was conducted.
                (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.
              
              
                § 60.1745
                What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a diluent gas?
                You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems. You may reestablish the relationship during annual evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
                (a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in appendix A of this part to determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon dioxide monitor.
                (b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 30 minutes in each hour.
                (c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B in appendix A of this part to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide.
              
              
                § 60.1750
                What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is the data collection requirement enforceable?
                (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level). Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen (or carbon dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level).
                (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute period.
                (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
                (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must notify the Administrator according to § 60.1885(e).
                (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with § 60.1755.
              
              
                § 60.1755
                How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into appropriate averaging times and units?
                (a) Use the equation in § 60.1935(a) to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen.

                (b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of sulfur dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 5.4, to determine the daily geometric average percent reduction of potential sulfur dioxide emissions.
                (c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.1, to calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen oxides.
                (d) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.
              
              
                § 60.1760
                What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring system and how are the data used?
                (a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system.
                (b) Install, evaluate, and operate each continuous opacity monitoring system according to § 60.13.
                (c) Complete an initial evaluation of your continuous opacity monitoring system according to Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of this part. Complete the evaluation by 180 days after your final compliance date.
                (d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
                (e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9 in appendix A of this part, as specified in § 60.1790, to determine compliance with the opacity limit in table 2 or 4 of this subpart. The data obtained from your continuous opacity monitoring system are not used to determine compliance with the opacity limit.
              
              
                § 60.1765
                What additional requirements must I meet for the operation of my continuous emission monitoring systems and continuous opacity monitoring system?
                Use the required span values and applicable performance specifications in table 8 of this subpart.
              
              
                § 60.1770
                What must I do if any of my continuous emission monitoring systems are temporarily unavailable to meet the data collection requirements?
                Refer to table 8 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for collecting data when systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum amount of data.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Stack Testing
              
                § 60.1775
                What types of stack tests must I conduct?
                Conduct initial and annual stack tests to measure the emission levels of dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
              
              
                § 60.1780
                How are the stack test data used?
                You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits in tables 2 and 4 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see § 60.1725.
              
              
                § 60.1785
                What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?
                (a) Conduct initial stack tests for the pollutants listed in § 60.1775 by 180 days after your final compliance date.
                (b) Conduct annual stack tests for the same pollutants after the initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack test no later than 13 months after the previous stack test.
              
              
                § 60.1790
                What test methods must I use to stack test?
                (a) Follow table 8 of this subpart to establish the sampling location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements for the different pollutants.

                (b) Make sure that stack tests for all the pollutants consist of at least three test runs, as specified in § 60.8. Use the average of the pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to determine compliance with the applicable emission limits in tables 2 and 4 of this subpart.
                (c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as specified in § 60.1720.
                (d) Use the equations in § 60.1935(a) to calculate emission levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test methods in table 6 of this subpart for other required equations.
                (e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under § 60.8(b) to use a reference method with minor changes in methodology, use an equivalent method, use an alternative method the results of which the Administrator has determined are adequate for demonstrating compliance, waive the requirement for a performance test because you have demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance, or use a shorter sampling time or smaller sampling volume.
              
              
                § 60.1795
                May I conduct stack testing less often?
                (a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission limit. In that case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every 3rd year but no later than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years show compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant. The provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
                (b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that are subject to this subpart. Second, all those municipal waste combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for 2 consecutive years. In that case, you may choose to conduct annual stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit per year at your plant. The provision only applies to stack testing for dioxins/furans emissions.
                (1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by the Administrator.
                (2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, you may continue stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year.

                (3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans emissions greater than 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, conduct subsequent annual stack tests on all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans emissions levels less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for all municipal waste combustion units at your plant subject to this subpart for 2 consecutive years.
              
              
                § 60.1800
                May I deviate from the 13-month testing schedule if unforeseen circumstances arise?
                You may not deviate from the 13-month testing schedules specified in §§ 60.1785(b) and 60.1795(b)(1) unless you apply to the Administrator for an alternative schedule, and the Administrator approves your request for alternate scheduling prior to the date on which you would otherwise have been required to conduct the next stack test.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Other Monitoring Requirements
              
                § 60.1805
                Must I meet other requirements for continuous monitoring?
                You must also monitor three operating parameters:
                (a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit.
                (b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate matter air pollution control device.
                (c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions.
              
              
                § 60.1810
                How do I monitor the load of my municipal waste combustion unit?
                (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit generates steam, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a steam flowmeter or a feed water flowmeter and meet five requirements:
                (1) Continuously measure and record the measurements of steam (or feed water) in kilograms (or pounds) per hour.
                (2) Calculate your steam (or feed water) flow in 4-hour block averages.
                (3) Calculate the steam (or feed water) flow rate using the method in “American Society of Mechanical Engineers Power Test Codes: Test Code for Steam Generating Units, Power Test Code 4.1—1964 (R1991),” section 4 (incorporated by reference in § 60.17(h)(2)).
                (4) Design, construct, install, calibrate, and use nozzles or orifices for flow rate measurements, using the recommendations in “American Society of Mechanical Engineers Interim Supplement 19.5 on Instruments and Apparatus: Application, part II of Fluid Meters,” 6th Edition (1971), chapter 4 (incorporated by reference in § 60.17(h)(3)).
                (5) Before each dioxins/furans stack test, or at least once a year, calibrate all signal conversion elements associated with steam (or feed water) flow measurements according to the manufacturer instructions.
                (b) If your municipal waste combustion units do not generate steam, or, if your municipal waste combustion units have shared steam systems and steam load cannot be estimated per unit, you must determine, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, one or more operating parameters that can be used to continuously estimate load level (for example, the feed rate of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel). You must continuously monitor the selected parameters.
              
              
                § 60.1815
                How do I monitor the temperature of flue gases at the inlet of my particulate matter control device?
                You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to continuously measure the temperature of the flue gas stream at the inlet of each particulate matter control device.
              
              
                § 60.1820
                How do I monitor the injection rate of activated carbon?
                If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must meet three requirements:
                (a) Select a carbon injection system operating parameter that can be used to calculate carbon feed rate (for example, screw feeder speed).

                (b) During each dioxins/furans and mercury stack test, determine the average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. Also, determine the average operating parameter level that correlates to the carbon feed rate. Establish a relationship between the operating parameter and the carbon feed rate in order to calculate the carbon feed rate based on the operating parameter level.
                (c) Continuously monitor the selected operating parameter during all periods when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating and combusting waste and calculate the 8-hour block average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour, based on the selected operating parameter. When calculating the 8-hour block average, do two things:
                (1) Exclude hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is not operating.
                (2) Include hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating but the carbon feed system is not working correctly.
              
              
                § 60.1825
                What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect with my continuous parameter monitoring systems and is the data collection requirement enforceable?
                (a) Where continuous parameter monitoring systems are used, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages for three parameters:
                (1) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit.
                (2) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of your particulate matter control device.
                (3) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions.
                (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average.
                (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
                (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection requirement, and you must notify the Administrator according to § 60.1885(e).

                  Where:
                  
                  C7
                    % = concentration corrected to 7 percent oxygen.

                  ER06DE00.004
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  %PHg = percent reduction of potential mercury emissions

                (d) Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit. For a municipal waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the municipal waste combustion unit capacity based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:
                (1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
                (i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).
                (ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).
                (2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
                (e) Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
                (f) Quarterly carbon usage. If you use activated carbon to comply with the dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required quarterly usage of carbon using equation 4 of this section for plant basis or equation 5 of this section for unit basis:
                (1) Plant basis.
                
                  ER06DE00.006
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  C = required quarterly carbon usage for the plant in kilograms (or pounds).
                  fi = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste combustion unit in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. That is the average carbon feed rate during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever has a higher feed rate).
                  hi = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was in operation during the calendar quarter (hours).
                  n = number of municipal waste combustion units, i, located at your plant.

                  ER06DE00.007
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  C = required quarterly carbon usage for the unit in kilograms (or pounds).
                  f = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste combustion unit in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. That is the average carbon feed rate during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever has a higher feed rate).
                  h = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was in operation during the calendar quarter (hours).

                § 60.2100
                What if all the qualified operators are temporarily not accessible?

                If all qualified operators are temporarily not accessible (i.e., not at the facility and not able to be at the facility within 1 hour), you must meet one of the two criteria specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, depending on the length of time that a qualified operator is not accessible:
                (a) When all qualified operators are not accessible for more than 8 hours, but less than 2 weeks, the CISWI may be operated by other plant personnel familiar with the operation of the CISWI who have completed a review of the information specified in § 60.2095(a) within the past 12 months. However, you must record the period when all qualified operators were not accessible and include this deviation in the annual report as specified under § 60.2210; and
                (b) When all qualified operators are not accessible for 2 weeks or more, you must take the two actions that are described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:
                (1) Notify the Administrator of this deviation in writing within 10 days. In the notice, state what caused this deviation, what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, and when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible; and
                (2) Submit a status report to the Administrator every 4 weeks outlining what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, stating when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible and requesting approval from the Administrator to continue operation of the CISWI. You must submit the first status report 4 weeks after you notify the Administrator of the deviation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the Administrator notifies you that your request to continue operation of the CISWI is disapproved, the CISWI may continue operation for 90 days, then must cease operation. Operation of the unit may resume if you meet the two requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:
                (i) A qualified operator is accessible as required under § 60.2070(a); and
                (ii) You notify the Administrator that a qualified operator is accessible and that you are resuming operation.
              
            
            
              Emission Limitations and Operating Limits
              
                § 60.2105
                What emission limitations must I meet and by when?
                (a) You must meet the emission limitations for each CISWI, including bypass stack or vent, specified in table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart by the applicable date in § 60.2140. You must be in compliance with the emission limitations of this subpart that apply to you at all times.

                (b) A CISWI or ACI that commenced construction after November 30, 1999, but no later than June 4, 2010, or that commenced reconstruction or modification on or after June 1, 2001 but no later than August 7, 2013, must continue to meet the emission limits in table 1 of this subpart for units in the incinerator subcategory and § 60.2250 for ACIs until the units become subject to the requirements of an approved state plan or federal plan that implements subpart DDDD of this part (Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units).
              
              
                § 60.2110
                What operating limits must I meet and by when?
                (a) If you use a wet scrubber(s) to comply with the emission limitations, you must establish operating limits for up to four operating parameters (as specified in table 2 of this subpart) as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial performance test:
                (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate:
                (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations; and
                (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
                (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet particulate matter scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average pressure drop across the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations;
                (3) Minimum scrubber liquid flow rate, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquid flow rate at the inlet to the wet acid gas or particulate matter scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations; and
                (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet acid gas scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride (HCl) emission limitation.
                (b) You must meet the operating limits established during the initial performance test 60 days after your CISWI reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after its initial startup.
                (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations and you do not use a particulate matter (PM) continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) for monitoring PM compliance, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. In calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.

                (d) If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limitations and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must measure the (secondary) voltage and amperage of the electrostatic precipitator collection plates during the particulate matter performance test. Calculate the average electric power value (secondary voltage × secondary current = secondary electric power) for each test run. The operating limit for the electrostatic precipitator is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average secondary electric power measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.
                

                (e) If you use activated carbon sorbent injection to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the sorbent flow rate during the performance testing. The operating limit for the carbon sorbent injection is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average sorbent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (e.g., for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).
                (f) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the charge rate, the secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI), and the reagent flow rate during the nitrogen oxides performance testing. The operating limits for the selective noncatalytic reduction are calculated as the highest 1-hour average charge rate, lower secondary chamber temperature, and lowest reagent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limitations.

                (g) If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the injection rate of each sorbent during the performance testing. The operating limit for the injection rate of each sorbent is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average injection rate for each sorbent measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (e.g., for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).
                (h) If you do not use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations, and if you do not determine compliance with your particulate matter emission limitation with either a particulate matter CEMS or a particulate matter CPMS, you must maintain opacity to less than or equal to 10 percent opacity (1-hour block average).
                (i) If you use a PM CPMS to demonstrate compliance, you must establish your PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section:
                (1) Determine your operating limit as the average PM CPMS output value recorded during the performance test or at a PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of the emission limit if your PM performance test demonstrates compliance below 75 percent of the emission limit. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test:
                (i) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output, or digital equivalent, and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps;
                (ii) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit; and

                (iii) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values, or their digital equivalent, from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (e.g., average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour Method 5I test runs).

                (2) If the average of your three PM performance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS output values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or performance test with the procedures in (i)(1) through (5) of this section:
                (i) Determine your instrument zero output with one of the following procedures:
                (A) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench;
                (B) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air;

                (C) The zero point can also can be established obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept; and
                (D) If none of the steps in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.
                (ii) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 1:
                
                  ER16AP19.006
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  X1 = the PM CPMS output data points for the three runs constituting the performance test,
                  Y1 = the PM concentration value for the three runs constituting the performance test, and
                  n = the number of data points.
                
                
                (iii) With your instrument zero expressed in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, your three run average PM CPMS milliamp value, or its digital equivalent, and your three run average PM concentration from your three compliance tests, determine a relationship of mg/dscm per milliamp or digital signal equivalent with equation 2:
                
                  ER16AP19.007
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  R = the relative mg/dscm per milliamp or digital equivalent for your PM CPMS,
                  Y1 = the three run average mg/dscm PM concentration,
                  X1 = the three run average milliamp or digital signal output from you PM CPMS, and
                  z = the milliamp or digital signal equivalent of your instrument zero determined from paragraph (2)(i) of this section.
                
                

                (iv) Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating limit using the mg/dscm per milliamp or digital value from equation 2 in equation 3, below. This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of your emission limit:
                
                  ER16AP19.008
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Ol = the operating limit for your PM CPMS on a 30-day rolling average, in milliamps or their digital signal equivalent,
                  L = your source emission limit expressed in mg/dscm,
                  z = your instrument zero in milliamps or the digital equivalent, determined from paragraph (2)(i) of this secction, and
                  R = the relative mg/dscm per milliamp or digital signal output equivalent for your PM CPMS, from equation 2.
                
                
                (3) If the average of your three PM compliance test runs is at or above 75 percent of your PM emission limit you must determine your operating limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp or digital signal output corresponding to your three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using equation 4 and you must submit all compliance test and PM CPMS data according to the reporting requirements in paragraph (i)(5) of this section:
                
                  ER16AP19.009
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  X1 = the PM CPMS data points for all runs i,
                  n = the number of data points, and
                  Oh = your site specific operating limit, in milliamps or digital signal equivalent.
                
                

                (4) To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (e.g., milliamps or digital signal bits, PM concentration, raw data signal) on a 30-day rolling average basis.

                (5) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (e.g., beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp or digital signal value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp or digital signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.
              
              
                § 60.2115
                What if I do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter, activated carbon injection, selective noncatalytic reduction, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations?

                If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, activated carbon injection, selective noncatalytic reduction, fabric filter, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber or limit emissions in some other manner, including material balances, to comply with the emission limitations under § 60.2105, you must petition the EPA Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must submit the petition at least sixty days before the performance test is scheduled to begin. Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section:
                (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as additional operating limits;
                (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters and how limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants;
                (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on these parameters;
                (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments; and
                (e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.
              
            
            
              Performance Testing
              
                § 60.2125
                How do I conduct the initial and annual performance test?
                (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations.
                (b) You must document that the waste burned during the performance test is representative of the waste burned under normal operating conditions by maintaining a log of the quantity of waste burned (as required in § 60.2175(b)(1)) and the types of waste burned during the performance test.
                (c) All performance tests must be conducted using the minimum run duration specified in table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart.

                (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using equation 5 of this section:
                
                  ER16AP19.010
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
                  Cmeas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis;
                  (20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen−7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis);
                  20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
                  %O2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
                
                
                (g) You must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency by following the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra-through octa-chlorinated isomer emitted using EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7;

                (2) Quantify isomers meeting identification criteria 2, 3, 4, and 5 in Section 5.3.2.5 of Method 23, regardless of whether the isomers meet identification criteria 1 and 7.

(Note: You may reanalyze the sample aliquot or split to reduce the number of isomers not meeting identification criteria 1 or 7 of Section 5.3.2.5.);
                (3) For each dioxin/furan (tetra-through octa-chlorinated) isomer measured in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, multiply the isomer concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in table 3 of this subpart; and
                (4) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
                (h) Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 of this part must be used to determine compliance with the fugitive ash emission limit in table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart.
                (i) If you have an applicable opacity operating limit, you must determine compliance with the opacity limit using Method 9 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4, based on three 1-hour blocks consisting of ten 6-minute average opacity values, unless you are required to install a continuous opacity monitoring system, consistent with §§ 60.2145 and 60.2165.
                (j) You must determine dioxins/furans total mass basis by following the procedures in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section:

                § 60.2130
                How are the performance test data used?
                You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations in table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart.
              
            
            
              Initial Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.2135
                How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations and establish the operating limits?
                (a) You must conduct a performance test, as required under §§ 60.2125 and 60.2105to determine compliance with the emission limitations in table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart, to establish compliance with any opacity operating limit in § 60.2110, to establish the kiln-specific emission limit in § 60.2145(y), as applicable, and to establish operating limits using the procedures in § 60.2110 or § 60.2115. The performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart and the procedures in § 60.2125. The use of the bypass stack during a performance test shall invalidate the performance test.
                (b) As an alternative to conducting a performance test, as required under §§ 60.2125 and 60.2105, you may use a 30-day rolling average of the 1-hour arithmetic average CEMS data, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart. You must conduct a performance evaluation of each continuous monitoring system within 180 days of installation of the monitoring system. The initial performance evaluation must be conducted prior to collecting CEMS data that will be used for the initial compliance demonstration.
              
              
                § 60.2140
                By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?

                (a) The initial performance test must be conducted within 60 days after your CISWI reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after its initial startup.
                
                (b) If you commence or recommence combusting a solid waste at an existing combustion unit at any commercial or industrial facility, and you conducted a test consistent with the provisions of this subpart while combusting the solid waste within the 6 months preceding the reintroduction of that solid waste in the combustion chamber, you do not need to retest until 6 months from the date you reintroduce that solid waste.
                (c) If you commence or recommence combusting a solid waste at an existing combustion unit at any commercial or industrial facility and you have not conducted a performance test consistent with the provisions of this subpart while combusting the solid waste within the 6 months preceding the reintroduction of that solid waste in the combustion chamber, you must conduct a performance test within 60 days from the date you reintroduce that solid waste.
              
              
                § 60.2141
                By what date must I conduct the initial air pollution control device inspection?
                (a) The initial air pollution control device inspection must be conducted within 60 days after installation of the control device and the associated CISWI reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after the device's initial startup.
                (b) Within 10 operating days following an air pollution control device inspection, all necessary repairs must be completed unless the owner or operator obtains written approval from the state agency establishing a date whereby all necessary repairs of the designated facility must be completed.
              
            
            
              Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.2145
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and the operating limits?
                (a) General compliance with standards, considering some units may be able to switch between solid waste and non-waste fuel combustion, is specified in paragraph (a)(1) through (6) of this section.
                (1) The emission standards and operating requirements set forth in this subpart apply at all times;

                (2) If you cease combusting solid waste, you may opt to remain subject to the provisions of this subpart. Consistent with the definition of CISWI, you are subject to the requirements of this subpart at least 6 months following the last date of solid waste combustion. Solid waste combustion is ceased when solid waste is not in the combustion chamber (i.e., the solid waste feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the solid waste residence time);
                (3) If you cease combusting solid waste, you must be in compliance with any newly applicable standards on the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch is a date selected by you, that must be at least 6 months from the date that you ceased combusting solid waste, consistent with § 60.2145(a)(2). Your source must remain in compliance with this subpart until the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch;
                (4) If you own or operate an existing commercial or industrial combustion unit that combusted a fuel or non-waste material, and you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste, you are subject to the provisions of this subpart as of the first day you introduce or reintroduce solid waste to the combustion chamber, and this date constitutes the effective date of the fuel-to-waste switch. You must complete all initial compliance demonstrations for any section 112 standards that are applicable to your facility before you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste. You must provide 30 days prior notice of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The notification must identify:
                (i) The name of the owner or operator of the CISWI, the location of the source, the emissions unit(s) that will cease burning solid waste, and the date of the notice;
                (ii) The currently applicable subcategory under this subpart, and any 40 CFR part 63 subpart and subcategory that will be applicable after you cease combusting solid waste;

                (iii) The fuel(s), non-waste material(s) and solid waste(s) the CISWI is currently combusting and has combusted over the past 6 months, and the fuel(s) or non-waste materials the unit will commence combusting;
                (iv) The date on which you became subject to the currently applicable emission limits; and

                (v) The date upon which you will cease combusting solid waste, and the date (if different) that you intend for any new requirements to become applicable (i.e., the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch), consistent with paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section.
                (5) All air pollution control equipment necessary for compliance with any newly applicable emissions limits which apply as a result of the cessation or commencement or recommencement of combusting solid waste must be installed and operational as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch.
                (6) All monitoring systems necessary for compliance with any newly applicable monitoring requirements which apply as a result of the cessation or commencement or recommencement of combusting solid waste must be installed and operational as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch. All calibration and drift checks must be performed as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch. Relative accuracy tests must be performed as of the performance test deadline for PM CEMS (if PM CEMS are elected to demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter emission limits). Relative accuracy testing for other CEMS need not be repeated if that testing was previously performed consistent with Clean Air Act section 112 monitoring requirements or monitoring requirements under this subpart.
                (b) You must conduct an annual performance test for the pollutants listed in table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart and opacity for each CISWI as required under § 60.2125. The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart and the procedures in § 60.2125. Annual performance tests are not required if you use CEMS or continuous opacity monitoring systems to determine compliance.
                (c) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in § 60.2110 or established under § 60.2115 and as specified in § 60.2170. Use 3-hour block average values to determine compliance (except for baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging period is established under § 60.2115 or, for energy recovery units, where the averaging time for each operating parameter is a 30-day rolling, calculated each hour as the average of the previous 720 operating hours. Operation above the established maximum, below the established minimum, or outside the allowable range of operating limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a deviation from your operating limits established under this subpart, except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission and operating limits or to establish new operating limits. Operating limits are confirmed or reestablished during performance tests.
                (d) You must burn only the same types of waste and fuels used to establish subcategory applicability (for energy recovery units) and operating limits during the performance test.
                (e) For energy recovery units, incinerators, and small remote units, you must perform an annual visual emissions test for ash handling.
                (f) For energy recovery units, you must conduct an annual performance test for opacity (except where particulate matter CEMS or continuous opacity monitoring systems are used are used) and the pollutants listed in table 6 of this subpart.
                (g) You may elect to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit using a carbon monoxide CEMS, as described in § 60.2165(o).

                (h) Coal and liquid/gas energy recovery units with average annual heat input rates greater than or equal to 250 million British thermal units/hour (MMBtu/hr) may elect to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the particulate matter emissions limit using a particulate matter CEMS according to the procedures in § 60.2165(n) instead of the PM CPMS specified in § 60.2145. Coal and liquid/gas energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates less than 250 MMBtu/hr, incinerators, and small remote incinerators may also elect to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance using a particulate matter CEMS according to the procedures in § 60.2165(n) instead of particulate matter testing with EPA Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 and, if applicable, the continuous opacity monitoring requirements in paragraph (i) of this section.
                (i) For energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than or equal to 10 MMBtu/hr and less than 250 MMBtu/hr that do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter with bag leak detection system, an electrostatic precipitator, particulate matter CEMS, or particulate matter CPMS, you must install, operate, certify and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) according to the procedures in § 60.2165(m).
                (j) For waste-burning kilns, you must conduct an annual performance test for cadmium, lead, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans and hydrogen chloride as listed in Table 7 of this subpart, unless you choose to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance using CEMS, as allowed in paragraph (u) of this section. If you do not use an acid gas wet scrubber or dry scrubber, you must determine compliance with the hydrogen chloride emissions limit using a HCl CEMS according to the requirements in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. You must determine compliance with the mercury emissions limit using a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system according to paragraph (j)(2) of this section. You must determine compliance with nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide using CEMS. You must determine compliance with particulate matter using CPMS.
                (1) If you monitor compliance with the HCl emissions limit by operating an HCl CEMS, you must do so in accordance with Performance Specification 15 (PS 15) of appendix B to 40 CFR part 60 or PS 18 of appendix B to 40 CFR part 60. You must operate, maintain, and quality assure a HCl CEMS installed and certified under PS 15 according to the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 except that the Relative Accuracy Test Audit requirements of Procedure 1 must be replaced with the validation requirements and criteria of sections 11.1.1 and 12.0 of PS 15. You must operate, maintain and quality assure a HCl CEMS installed and certified under PS 18 according to the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 6 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 60. For any performance specification that you use, you must use Method 321 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 63 as the reference test method for conducting relative accuracy testing. The span value and calibration requirements in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to all HCl CEMS used under this subpart:
                (i) You must use a measurement span value for any HCl CEMS of 0-10 ppmvw unless the monitor is installed on a kiln without an inline raw mill. Kilns without an inline raw mill may use a higher span value sufficient to quantify all expected emissions concentrations. The HCl CEMS data recorder output range must include the full range of expected HCl concentration values which would include those expected during “mill off” conditions. The corresponding data recorder range shall be documented in the site-specific monitoring plan and associated records;
                (ii) In order to quality assure data measured above the span value, you must use one of the three options in paragraphs (j)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section:
                (A) Include a second span that encompasses the HCl emission concentrations expected to be encountered during “mill off” conditions. This second span may be rounded to a multiple of 5 ppm of total HCl. The requirements of the appropriate HCl monitor performance specification shall be followed for this second span with the exception that a RATA with the mill off is not required;

                (B) Quality assure any data above the span value by proving instrument linearity beyond the span value established in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section using the following procedure. Conduct a weekly “above span linearity” calibration challenge of the monitoring system using a reference gas with a certified value greater than your highest expected hourly concentration or greater than 75% of the highest measured hourly concentration. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of the applicable performance specification and must be introduced to the measurement system at the probe. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The “above span linearity” challenge is successful if the value measured by the HCl CEMS falls within 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the HCl CEMS during the above span linearity challenge exceeds 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, the monitoring system must be evaluated and repaired and a new “above span linearity” challenge met before returning the HCl CEMS to service, or data above span from the HCl CEMS must be subject to the quality assurance procedures established in (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. In this manner values measured by the HCl CEMS during the above span linearity challenge exceeding ±20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas must be normalized using equation 6;
                (C) Quality assure any data above the span value established in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section using the following procedure. Any time two consecutive one-hour average measured concentration of HCl exceeds the span value you must, within 24 hours before or after, introduce a higher, “above span” HCl reference gas standard to the HCl CEMS. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of the applicable performance specification and target a concentration level between 50 and 150 percent of the highest expected hourly concentration measured during the period of measurements above span, and must be introduced at the probe. While this target represents a desired concentration range that is not always achievable in practice, it is expected that the intent to meet this range is demonstrated by the value of the reference gas. Expected values may include above span calibrations done before or after the above-span measurement period. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The “above span” calibration is successful if the value measured by the HCl CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the HCl CEMS is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, then you must normalize the stack gas values measured above span as described in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. If the “above span” calibration is conducted during the period when measured emissions are above span and there is a failure to collect the one data point in an hour due to the calibration duration, then you must determine the emissions average for that missed hour as the average of hourly averages for the hour preceding the missed hour and the hour following the missed hour. In an hour where an “above span” calibration is being conducted and one or more data points are collected, the emissions average is represented by the average of all valid data points collected in that hour;

                (D) In the event that the “above span” calibration is not successful (i.e., the HCl CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the “above span” calibration for reporting based on the HCl CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in equation 6:
                
                  ER16AP19.011
                
                Only one “above span” calibration is needed per 24-hour period.

                (2) Compliance with the mercury emissions limit must be determined using a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system according to the following requirements:
                (i) You must operate a mercury CEMS system in accordance with performance specification 12A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system in accordance with performance specification 12B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B; these monitoring systems must be quality assured according to procedure 5 of 40 CFR 60, appendix F. For the purposes of emissions calculations when using an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, the mercury concentration determined for each sampling period must be assigned to each hour during the sampling period. If you choose to comply with the production-rate based mercury limit for your waste-burning kiln, you must also monitor hourly clinker production and determine the hourly mercury emissions rate in pounds per million ton of clinker produced. You must demonstrate compliance with the mercury emissions limit using a 30-day rolling average of these 1-hour mercury concentrations or mass emissions rates, including CEMS and integerated sorbent trap monitoring system data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 of this part.

                (ii) Owners or operators using a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system to determine mass emission rate must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the mercury mass emissions rate to the atmosphere according to the requirements of performance specification 6 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and conducting an annual relative accuracy test of the continuous emission rate monitoring system according to section 8.2 of performance specification 6; and
                (iii) The owner or operator of a waste-burning kiln must demonstrate initial compliance by operating a mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is operating under normal conditions and including at least one period when the raw mill is off.

Alternatively, install and verify the operation of a new pressure sensor.
                (o) If you have an operating limit that requires a pH monitoring system, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (l) and (o)(1) through (4) of this section:
                (1) Install the pH sensor in a position that provides a representative measurement of scrubber effluent pH;
                (2) Ensure the sample is properly mixed and representative of the fluid to be measured;

The sulfur dioxide CEMS must follow the procedures and methods specified in paragraph (s) of this section. For sources that have actual inlet emissions less than 100 parts per million dry volume, the relative accuracy criterion for inlet sulfur dioxide CEMS should be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the reference method test data in terms of the units of the emission standard, or 5 parts per million dry volume absolute value of the mean difference between the reference method and the CEMS, whichever is greater:
                (1) During each relative accuracy test run of the CEMS required by performance specification 2 in appendix B of this part, collect sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data concurrently (or within a 30- to 60-minute period) with both the CEMS and the test methods specified in paragraphs (s)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:

                (i) For sulfur dioxide, EPA Reference Method 6 or 6C, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) must be used; and

The nitrogen oxides CEMS must follow the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (t)(1) through (4) of this section:
                
                (1) During each relative accuracy test run of the CEMS required by performance specification 2 of appendix B of this part, collect nitrogen oxides and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data concurrently (or within a 30- to 60-minute period) with both the CEMS and the test methods specified in paragraphs (t)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:

                (ii) For oxygen (or carbon dioxide), EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19-10.1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), as applicable, must be used.
                (2) The span value of the continuous emission monitoring system must be 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential nitrogen oxide emissions of the unit.
                (3) Conduct accuracy determinations quarterly and calibration drift tests daily in accordance with procedure 1 in appendix F of this part.
                (4) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. If carbon dioxide is selected for use in diluent corrections, the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels must be established during the initial performance test according to the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (t)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section. This relationship may be re-established during performance compliance tests:

                (i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B must be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3A or 3B, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), as applicable, must be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor;
                (ii) Samples must be taken for at least 30 minutes in each hour;
                (iii) Each sample must represent a 1-hour average; and
                (iv) A minimum of three runs must be performed.
                (u) For facilities using a CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for mercury to demonstrate initial and continuouscompliance with any of the emission limits of this subpart, you must complete the following:
                (1) Demonstrate compliance with the appropriate emission limit(s) using a 30-day rolling average of 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at appendix A-7 of this part. The 1-hour arithmetic averages for CEMS must be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2). Except for CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems data during startup and shutdown, the 1-hour arithmetic averages used to calculate the 30-day rolling average emission concentrations must be corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis). Integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems or CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in the subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content; and
                (2) Operate all CEMS and integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems in accordance with the applicable procedures under appendices B and F of this part.
                (v) Use of the bypass stack at any time is an emissions standards deviation for PM, HCl, lead, cadmium, mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and dioxin/furans.
                (w) For energy recovery units with a design heat input capacity of 100 MMBtu/hr or greater that do not use a carbon monoxide CEMS, you must install, operate, and maintain a oxygen analyzer system as defined in § 60.2265 according to the procedures in paragraphs (w)(1) through (4) of this section:
                (1) The oxygen analyzer system must be installed by the initial performance test date specified in § 60.2140;

                (2) You must operate the oxygen trim system within compliance with paragraph (w)(3) of this section at all times;
                
                (3) You must maintain the oxygen level such that the 30-day rolling average that is established as the operating limit for oxygen is not below the lowest hourly average oxygen concentration measured during the most recent CO performance test; and
                (4) You must calculate and record a 30-day rolling average oxygen concentration using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.

                (x) For energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than or equal to 250 MMBtu/hr and waste-burning kilns, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a PM CPMS and record the output of the system as specified in paragraphs (x)(1) through (8) of this section. For other energy recovery units, you may elect to use PM CPMS operated in accordance with this section. PM CPMS are suitable in lieu of using other CMS for monitoring PM compliance (e.g., bag leak detectors, ESP secondary power, PM scrubber pressure):
                (1) Install, calibrate, operate, and maintain your PM CPMS according to the procedures in your approved site-specific monitoring plan developed in accordance with paragraphs (l) and (x)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
                (i) The operating principle of the PM CPMS must be based on in-stack or extractive light scatter, light scintillation, beta attenuation, or mass accumulation detection of the exhaust gas or representative sample. The reportable measurement output from the PM CPMS must be expressed as milliamps or the digital signal equivalent;
                (ii) The PM CPMS must have a cycle time (i.e., period required to complete sampling, measurement, and reporting for each measurement) no longer than 60 minutes; and
                (iii) The PM CPMS must be capable of detecting and responding to particulate matter concentrations increments no greater than 0.5 mg/actual cubic meter.
                (2) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, you must adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test according to the procedures specified in § 60.2110.
                (3) Collect PM CPMS hourly average output data for all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours. Express the PM CPMS output as milliamps.
                (4) Calculate the arithmetic 30-day rolling average of all of the hourly average PM CPMS output collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours data (milliamps or their digital equivalent).
                (5) You must collect data using the PM CPMS at all times the energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (x)(1)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (6) You must use all the data collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:
                (i) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions are not used in calculations (report any such periods in your annual deviation report);
                (ii) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during out-of-control periods are not used in calculations (report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report);

                (iii) Any PM CPMS data recorded during periods of CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart.
                (7) You must record and make available upon request results of PM CPMS system performance audits, as well as the dates and duration of periods from when the PM CPMS is out of control until completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the PM CPMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (8) For any deviation of the 30-day rolling average PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit, you must:
                (i) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;
                (ii) If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value;
                (iii) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit. Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under paragraph (x) of this section; and
                (iv) PM CPMS deviations leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a violation of this subpart.
                (y) When there is an alkali bypass and/or an in-line coal mill that exhaust emissions through a separate stack(s), the combined emissions are subject to the emission limits applicable to waste-burning kilns. To determine the kiln-specific emission limit for demonstrating compliance, you must:
                (1) Calculate a kiln-specific emission limit using equation 7:
                
                  ER16AP19.012
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cks = Kiln stack concentration (ppmvd, mg/dscm, ng/dscm, depending on pollutant. Each corrected to 7% O2.)
                  Qab = Alkali bypass flow rate (volume/hr)
                  Cab = Alkali bypass concentration (ppmvd, mg/dscm, ng/dscm, depending on pollutant. Each corrected to 7% O2.)
                  Qcm = In-line coal mill flow rate (volume/hr)
                  Ccm = In-line coal mill concentration (ppmvd, mg/dscm, ng/dscm, depending on pollutant. Each corrected to 7% O2.)
                  Qks = Kiln stack flow rate (volume/hr)
                
                
                (2) Particulate matter concentration must be measured downstream of the in-line coal mill. All other pollutant concentrations must be measured either upstream or downstream of the in-line coal mill; and
                (3) For purposes of determining the combined emissions from kilns equipped with an alkali bypass or that exhaust kiln gases to a coal mill that exhausts through a separate stack, instead of installing a CEMS or PM CPMS on the alkali bypass stack or in-line coal mill stack, the results of the initial and subsequent performance test can be used to demonstrate compliance with the relevant emissions limit. A performance test must be conducted on an annual basis (between 11 and 13 calendar months following the previous performance test).
              
              
                § 60.2150
                By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?
                You must conduct annual performance tests between 11 and 13 months of the previous performance test.
              
              
                § 60.2151
                By what date must I conduct the annual air pollution control device inspection?
                On an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous annual air pollution control device inspection), you must complete the air pollution control device inspection as described in § 60.2141.
              
              
                
                § 60.2155
                May I conduct performance testing less often?
                (a) You must conduct annual performance tests according to the schedule specified in § 60.2150, with the following exceptions:
                (1) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits, as specified in § 60.2160. New operating limits become effective on the date that the performance test report is submitted to the EPA's Central Data Exchange or postmarked, per the requirements of § 60.2235(b). The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time;
                (2) You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process change, as defined in § 60.2265;
                (3) You can conduct performance tests less often if you meet the following conditions: your performance tests for the pollutant for at least 2 consecutive performance tests demonstrates that the emission level for the pollutant is no greater than the emission level specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable; there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions; and you are not required to conduct a performance test for the pollutant in response to a request by the Administrator in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a process change in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test for the pollutant no more than 37 months following the previous performance test for the pollutant. If the emission level for your CISWI continues to meet the emission level specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year, as long as there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions. Each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
                (i) For particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead and dioxins/furans, the emission level equal to 75 percent of the applicable emission limit in table 1 or tables 5 through 8 of this subpart, as applicable; and
                (ii) For fugitive emissions, visible emissions (of combustion ash from the ash conveying system) for 2 percent of the time during each of the three 1-hour observations periods.
                (4) If you are conducting less frequent testing for a pollutant as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and a subsequent performance test for the pollutant indicates that your CISWI does not meet the emission level specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable, you must conduct annual performance tests for the pollutant according to the schedule specified in paragraph (a) of this section until you qualify for less frequent testing for the pollutant as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
                (b) [Reserved]
              
              
                § 60.2160
                May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish new operating limits?
                (a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
                (b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to demonstrate compliance.
              
            
            
              Monitoring
              
                § 60.2165
                What monitoring equipment must I install and what parameters must I monitor?

                (a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitation under § 60.2105, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in table 2 of this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in table 2 of this subpart at all times except as specified in § 60.2170(a).
                (b) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the requirements of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS or PM CEMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate a bag leak detection system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section:
                (1) You must install and operate a bag leak detection system for each exhaust stack of the fabric filter;
                (2) Each bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations;
                (3) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter or less;
                (4) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative or absolute particulate matter loadings;
                (5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor;
                (6) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will alert automatically an operator when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is observed easily by plant operating personnel;
                (7) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detection system must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell. For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter; and
                (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
                (c) If you are using something other than a wet scrubber, activated carbon, selective non-catalytic reduction, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under § 60.2105, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established using the procedures in § 60.2115.
                (d) If you use activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart, you must measure the minimum mercury sorbent flow rate once per hour.
                (e) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations, you must complete the following:
                (1) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.2125, whichever date comes first, ensure that the affected facility does not operate above the maximum charge rate, or below the minimum secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI) or the minimum reagent flow rate measured as 3-hour block averages at all times; and
                (2) Operation of the affected facility above the maximum charge rate, below the minimum secondary chamber temperature and below the minimum reagent flow rate simultaneously constitute a violation of the nitrogen oxides emissions limit.
                (f) If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limits of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must monitor the secondary power to the electrostatic precipitator collection plates and maintain the 3-hour block averages at or above the operating limits established during the mercury or particulate matter performance test.

                (g) For waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring hydrogen chloride emissions discharged to the atmosphere, as specified in § 60.2145(j), and record the output of the system. You may substitute use of a HCl CEMS for conducting the HCl initial and annual testing with EPA Method 321 at 40 CFR part 63, appendix A. For units other than waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, a facility may substitute use of a hydrogen chloride CEMS for conducting the hydrogen chloride initial and annual performance test. For units equipped with a hydrogen chloride CEMS, you are not required to monitor the minimum hydrogen chloride sorbent flow rate, the minimum scrubber liquor pH, or the monitoring minimum injection rate.

                (h) To demonstrate compliance with the particulate matter emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a particulate matter CEMS for conducting the PM initial and annual performance test. For units equipped with a particulate matter CEMS, you are not required to use other CMS for monitoring PM compliance (e.g., bag leak detectors, ESP secondary power, PM scrubber pressure).

                (i) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the dioxin/furan emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a continuous automated sampling system for the dioxin/furan initial and annual performance tests. You must record the output of the system and analyze the sample according to EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 of this part. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to dioxin/furan from continuous monitors is published in the Federal Register. The owner or operator who elects to continuously sample dioxin/furan emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous automated sampling system and must comply with the requirements specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q). A facility may substitute continuous dioxin/furan monitoring for the minimum sorbent flow rate, if activated carbon sorbent injection is used solely for compliance with the dioxin/furan emission limit.
                (j) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the mercury emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for the mercury initial and annual performance test. The owner or operator who elects to continuously measure mercury emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Reference Method 29 or 30B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, ASTM D6784-02 (Reapproved 2008) (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or an approved alternative method for measuring mercury emissions, must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate the mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoring system and must comply with performance specification 12A or performance specification 12B, respectively, and quality assurance procedure 5. For the purposes of emissions calculations when using an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, the mercury concentration determined for each sampling period must be assigned to each hour during the sampling period. Waste-burning kilns must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system as specified in § 60.2145(j). For units equipped with a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, you are not required to monitor the minimum sorbent flow rate, if activated carbon sorbent injection is used solely for compliance with the mercury emission limit.
                (k) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the nitrogen oxides emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a CEMS for the nitrogen oxides initial and annual performance test to demonstrate compliance with the nitrogen oxides emissions limits. For units equipped with a nitrogen oxides CEMS, you are not required to monitor the charge rate, secondary chamber temperature, and reagent flow for selective noncatalytic reduction, if applicable:
                (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring nitrogen oxides emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The requirements under performance specification 2 of appendix B of this part, the quality assurance procedure 1 of appendix F of this part and the procedures under § 60.13 must be followed for installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS; and

                (2) Compliance with the emission limit for nitrogen oxides must be determined based on the 30-day rolling average of the hourly emission concentrations using CEMS outlet data, as outlined in § 60.2145(u).
                
                (l) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the sulfur dioxide emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a CEMS for the sulfur dioxide initial and annual performance test to demonstrate compliance with the sulfur dioxide emissions limits:
                (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring sulfur dioxide emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The requirements under performance specification 2 of appendix B of this part, the quality assurance requirements of procedure one of appendix F of this part and procedures under § 60.13 must be followed for installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS; and
                (2) Compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limit shall be determined based on the 30-day rolling average of the hourly arithmetic average emission concentrations using CEMS outlet data, as outlined in § 60.2145(u).
                (m) For energy recovery units over 10 MMBtu/hr but less than 250 MMBtu/hr annual average heat input rates that do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter with bag leak detection system, an electrostatic precipitator, particulate matter CEMS, or particulate matter CPMS you must install, operate, certify, and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system according to the procedures in paragraphs (m)(1) through (5) of this section by the compliance date specified in § 60.2105. Energy recovery units that use a CEMS to demonstrate initial and continuing compliance according to the procedures in § 60.2165(n) are not required to install a continuous opacity monitoring system and must perform the annual performance tests for the opacity consistent with § 60.2145(f):
                (1) Install, operate, and maintain each continuous opacity monitoring system according to performance specification 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B;
                (2) Conduct a performance evaluation of each continuous opacity monitoring system according to the requirements in § 60.13 and according to PS-1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B;
                (3) As specified in § 60.13(e)(1), each continuous opacity monitoring system must complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period;
                (4) Reduce the continuous opacity monitoring system data as specified in § 60.13(h)(1); and
                (5) Determine and record all the 6-minute averages (and 1-hour block averages as applicable) collected.
                (n) For coal and liquid/gas energy recovery units, incinerators, and small remote incinerators, an owner or operator may elect to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring particulate matter emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an affected facility who continuously monitors particulate matter emissions instead of conducting performance testing using EPA Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 or monitoring with a particulate matter CPMS according to paragraph (r) of this section, must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a PM CEMS and must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (n)(1) through (10) of this section:
                (1) The PM CEMS must be installed, evaluated, and operated in accordance with the requirements of performance specification 11 of appendix B of this part and quality assurance requirements of procedure 2 of appendix F of this part and § 60.13. Use Method 5 or Method 5I of appendix A of this part for the PM CEMS correlation testing;
                (2) The initial performance evaluation must be completed no later than 180 days after the date of initial startup of the affected facility, as specified under § 60.2125 or within 180 days of notification to the Administrator of use of the continuous monitoring system if the owner or operator was previously determining compliance by Method 5 performance tests, whichever is later;

                (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the particulate matter emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. The relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels for the affected facility must be established according to the procedures and methods specified in § 60.2145(t)(4)(i) through (iv);
                (4) The owner or operator of an affected facility must conduct an initial performance test for particulate matter emissions. If PM CEMS are elected for demonstrating compliance, and the initial performance test has not yet been conducted, then initial compliance must be determined by using the CEMS specified in paragraph (n) of this section to measure particulate matter. You must calculate a 30-day rolling average of 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7;
                (5) Continuous compliance with the particulate matter emission limit must be determined based on the 30-day rolling average calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 from the 1-hour arithmetic average CEMS outlet data;
                (6) At a minimum, valid continuous monitoring system hourly averages must be obtained as specified in § 60.2170(e);
                (7) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required under paragraph (n)(5) of this section must be expressed in milligrams per dry standard cubic meter corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis) and must be used to calculate the 30-day rolling average emission concentrations. CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content. The 1-hour arithmetic averages must be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2);
                (8) All valid CEMS data must be used in calculating average emission concentrations even if the minimum CEMS data requirements of paragraph (n)(6) of this section are not met.
                (9) The CEMS must be operated according to performance specification 11 in appendix B of this part; and,
                (10) Quarterly and yearly accuracy audits and daily drift, system optics, and sample volume checks must be performed in accordance with procedure 2 in appendix F of this part.
                (o) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limit, you may substitute use of a CEMS for the carbon monoxide initial and annual performance test:
                (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring carbon monoxide emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The requirements under performance specification 4A or 4B of appendix B of this part, the quality assurance procedure 1 of appendix F of this part and the procedures under § 60.13 must be followed for installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS; and
                (2) Compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit shall be determined based on the 30-day rolling average of the hourly arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, using CEMS outlet data, as outlined in § 60.2145(u).
                (p) The owner/operator of an affected source with a bypass stack shall install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate a device or method for measuring the use of the bypass stack including date, time and duration.
                (q) For energy recovery units with a design heat input capacity of 100 MMBtu/hr or greater that do not use a carbon monoxide CEMS, you must install, operate, and maintain a oxygen analyzer system as defined in § 60.2265 according to the procedures in paragraphs (q)(1) through (4) of this section:
                (1) The oxygen analyzer system must be installed by the initial performance test date specified in § 60.2140;
                (2) You must operate the oxygen trim system within compliance with paragraph (q)(3) of this section at all times;

                (3) You must maintain the oxygen level such that the 30-day rolling average that is established as the operating limit for oxygen according to paragraph (q)(4) of this section is not below the lowest hourly average oxygen concentration measured during the most recent CO performance test; and
                
                (4) You must calculate and record a 30-day rolling average oxygen concentration using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.

                (r) For energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than or equal to 250 MMBtu/hr and waste-burning kilns, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a PM CPMS and record the output of the system as specified in paragraphs (r)(1) through (8) of this section. If you elect to use a particulate matter CEMS as specified in paragraph (n) of this section, you are not required to use a PM CPMS to monitor particulate matter emissions. For other energy recovery units, you may elect to use PM CPMS operated in accordance with this section. PM CPMS are suitable in lieu of using other CMS for monitoring PM compliance (e.g., bag leak detectors, ESP secondary power, PM scrubber pressure):
                (1) Install, calibrate, operate, and maintain your PM CPMS according to the procedures in your approved site-specific monitoring plan developed in accordance with § 60.2145(l) and paragraphs (r)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
                (i) The operating principle of the PM CPMS must be based on in-stack or extractive light scatter, light scintillation, beta attenuation, or mass accumulation detection of PM in the exhaust gas or representative sample. The reportable measurement output from the PM CPMS must be expressed as milliamps or a digital signal equivalent;
                (ii) The PM CPMS must have a cycle time (i.e., period required to complete sampling, measurement, and reporting for each measurement) no longer than 60 minutes; and
                (iii) The PM CPMS must be capable of detecting and responding to particulate matter concentration increments no greater than 0.5 mg/actual cubic meter.
                (2) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, you must adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test according to the procedures specified in § 60.2110.
                (3) Collect PM CPMS hourly average output data for all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours. Express the PM CPMS output as milliamps or the digital signal equivalent.
                (4) Calculate the arithmetic 30-day rolling average of all of the hourly average PM CPMS output collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours data (milliamps or digital bits).
                (5) You must collect data using the PM CPMS at all times the energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (6) You must use all the data collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:
                (i) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions are not used in calculations (report any such periods in your annual deviation report);
                (ii) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during out-of-control periods are not used in calculations (report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report); and

                (iii) Any PM CPMS data recorded during periods of CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart.
                (7) You must record and make available upon request results of PM CPMS system performance audits, as well as the dates and duration of periods from when the PM CPMS is out of control until completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the PM CPMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (8) For any deviation of the 30-day rolling average PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit, you must:
                (i) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;
                (ii) If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value;
                (iii) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit and to verify the operation of the emissions control device(s). Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under this paragraph; and
                (iv) PM CPMS deviations leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a violation of this subpart.
                (s) If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limits of this subpart, you must monitor the injection rate of each sorbent and maintain the 3-hour block averages at or above the operating limits established during the hydrogen chloride performance test.
                (t) If you are required to monitor clinker production because you comply with the production-rate based mercury limit for your waste-burning kiln, you must:
                (1) Determine hourly clinker production by one of two methods:
                (i) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates in tons-mass per hour of the amount of clinker produced. The system of measuring hourly clinker production must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy, or
                (ii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates in tons-mass per hour of the amount of feed to the kiln. The system of measuring feed must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy. Calculate your hourly clinker production rate using a kiln-specific feed to clinker ratio based on reconciled clinker production determined for accounting purposes and recorded feed rates. Update this ratio monthly. Note that if this ratio changes at clinker reconciliation, you must use the new ratio going forward, but you do not have to retroactively change clinker production rates previously estimated.
                (2) Determine the accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production (or feed mass flow if applicable) before the effective date and during each quarter of source operation.

                § 60.2170
                Is there a minimum amount of monitoring data I must obtain?
                For each continuous monitoring system required or optionally allowed under § 60.2165, you must collect data according to this section:

                (a) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times compliance is required except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods (as specified in 60.2210(o)), and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments). A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to effect monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable;
                (b) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use all the data collected during all other periods, including data normalized for above scale readings, in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system; and
                (c) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments, failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements.

                  In-line coal mill means those coal mills using kiln exhaust gases in their process. Coal mills with a heat source other than the kiln or coal mills using exhaust gases from the clinker cooler alone are not an in-line coal mill.
                
                  In-line kiln/raw mill means a system in a Portland Cement production process where a dry kiln system is integrated with the raw mill so that all or a portion of the kiln exhaust gases are used to perform the drying operation of the raw mill, with no auxiliary heat source used. In this system the kiln is capable of operating without the raw mill operating, but the raw mill cannot operate without the kiln gases, and consequently, the raw mill does not generate a separate exhaust gas stream.
                
                  Kiln means an oven or furnace, including any associated preheater or precalciner devices, in-line raw mills, in-line coal mills or alkali bypasses used for processing a substance by burning, firing or drying. Kilns include cement kilns that produce clinker by heating limestone and other materials for subsequent production of Portland Cement. Because the alkali bypass, in-line raw mill and in-line coal mill are considered an integral part of the kiln, the kiln emissions limits also apply to the exhaust of the alkali bypass, in-line raw mill and in-line coal mill.
                
                
                  Laboratory analysis unit means units that burn samples of materials for the purpose of chemical or physical analysis. A laboratory analysis unit is not an incinerator, waste-burning kiln, an energy recovery unit or a small, remote incinerator under this subpart.

              Introduction
              
                § 60.2500
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance schedules for the control of emissions from commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units (CISWIs) and air curtain incinerators (ACIs). The pollutants addressed by these emission guidelines are listed in table 2 of this subpart and tables 6 through 9 of this subpart. These emission guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part.
              
              
                § 60.2505
                Am I affected by this subpart?
                (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a state or United States protectorate with one or more existing CISWIs that meet the criteria in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, you must submit a state plan to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (b) You must submit a state plan to EPA by December 3, 2001 for incinerator units that commenced construction on or before November 30, 1999 and that were not modified or reconstructed after June 1, 2001.
                (c) You must submit a state plan that meets the requirements of this subpart and contains the more stringent emission limit for the respective pollutant in table 6 of this subpart or table 1 of subpart CCCC of this part to EPA by February 7, 2014 for incinerators that commenced construction after November 30, 1999, but no later than June 4, 2010, or commenced modification or reconstruction after June 1, 2001 but no later than August 7, 2013.
                (d) You must submit a state plan to EPA that meets the requirements of this subpart and contains the emission limits in tables 7 through 9 of this subpart by February 7, 2014, for CISWIs other than incinerator units that commenced construction on or before June 4, 2010, or commenced modification or reconstruction after June 4, 2010 but no later than August 7, 2013.
              
              
                § 60.2510
                Is a state plan required for all states?
                No. You are not required to submit a state plan if there are no existing CISWIs in your state, and you submit a negative declaration letter in place of the state plan.
              
              
                § 60.2515
                What must I include in my state plan?
                (a) You must include the nine items described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (9) of this section in your state plan:
                (1) Inventory of affected CISWIs, including those that have ceased operation but have not been dismantled;
                (2) Inventory of emissions from affected CISWIs in your state;
                (3) Compliance schedules for each affected CISWI;
                (4) Emission limitations, operator training and qualification requirements, a waste management plan, and operating limits for affected CISWIs that are at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart;
                (5) Performance testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements;
                (6) Certification that the hearing on the state plan was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission;
                (7) Provision for state progress reports to EPA;
                (8) Identification of enforceable state mechanisms that you selected for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart; and
                (9) Demonstration of your state's legal authority to carry out the sections 111(d) and 129 state plan.

                (b) Your state plan may deviate from the format and content of the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. However, if your state plan does deviate in content, you must demonstrate that your state plan is at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Your state plan must address regulatory applicability, increments of progress for retrofit, operator training and qualification, a waste management plan, emission limitations, performance testing, operating limits, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting, and ACI requirements.
                (c) You must follow the requirements of subpart B of this part (Adoption and Submittal of State Plans for Designated Facilities) in your state plan.
              
              
                § 60.2520
                Is there an approval process for my state plan?
                Yes. The EPA will review your state plan according to § 60.27.
              
              
                § 60.2525
                What if my state plan is not approvable?
                (a) If you do not submit an approvable state plan (or a negative declaration letter) by December 2, 2002, EPA will develop a federal plan according to § 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of CISWIs not covered by an approved state plan must comply with the federal plan. The federal plan is an interim action and will be automatically withdrawn when your state plan is approved.
                (b) If you do not submit an approvable state plan (or a negative declaration letter) to EPA that meets the requirements of this subpart and contains the emission limits in tables 6 through 9 of this subpart for CISWIs that commenced construction on or before June 4, 2010 and incinerator or ACIs that commenced reconstruction or modification on or after June 1, 2001 but no later than August 7, 2013, then EPA will develop a federal plan according to § 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of CISWIs not covered by an approved state plan must comply with the federal plan. The federal plan is an interim action and will be automatically withdrawn when your state plan is approved.
              
              
                § 60.2530
                Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?

                No. The EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, EPA will place a copy in the public docket and publish a document in the Federal Register. If, at a later date, an existing CISWI is found in your state, the federal plan implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart would automatically apply to that CISWI until your state plan is approved.
              
              
                § 60.2535
                What compliance schedule must I include in my state plan?
                (a) For CISWIs in the incinerator subcategory and ACIs that commenced construction on or before November 30, 1999, your state plan must include compliance schedules that require CISWIs in the incinerator subcategory and ACIs to achieve final compliance as expeditiously as practicable after approval of the state plan but not later than the earlier of the two dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:
                (1) December 1, 2005; and
                (2) Three years after the effective date of state plan approval.
                (b) For CISWIs in the incinerator subcategory and ACIs that commenced construction after November 30, 1999, but on or before June 4, 2010 or that commenced reconstruction or modification on or after June 1, 2001 but no later than August 7, 2013, and for CISWIs in the small remote incinerator, energy recovery unit, and waste-burning kiln subcategories that commenced construction before June 4, 2010, your state plan must include compliance schedules that require CISWIs to achieve final compliance as expeditiously as practicable after approval of the state plan but not later than the earlier of the two dates specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:
                (1) February 7, 2018; and
                (2) Three years after the effective date of State plan approval.

                (c) For compliance schedules more than 1 year following the effective date of State plan approval, State plans must include dates for enforceable increments of progress as specified in § 60.2580.
              
              
                § 60.2540
                Are there any state plan requirements for this subpart that apply instead of the requirements specified in subpart B?
                Yes. Subpart B establishes general requirements for developing and processing section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part for paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
                (a) State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State plans must require all CISWIs to comply by the dates specified in § 60.2535. This applies instead of the option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in § 60.24(f); and
                (b) State plans developed to implement this subpart are required to include two increments of progress for the affected CISWIs. These two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal date and final compliance date in § 60.21(h)(1) and (5). This applies instead of the requirement of § 60.24(e)(1) that would require a state plan to include all five increments of progress for all CISWIs.
              
              
                § 60.2541
                In lieu of a state plan submittal, are there other acceptable option(s) for a state to meet its Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129(b)(2) obligations?
                Yes, a state may meet its Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 obligations.
                (a) An acceptable federal plan delegation request must include the following:
                (1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the federal plan;
                (2) The items under § 60.2515(a)(1), (2) and (7);
                (3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission; and
                (4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions, and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in EPA's Delegation Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)/(2)/129(b)(3) federal plans.
                (b) A state with an already approved CISWI Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the revised federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of EPA's previous state plan approval.
                (c) A state's Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under Title V of the Clean Air Act.
              
              
                § 60.2542
                What authorities will not be delegated to state, local, or tribal agencies?
                The authorities that will not be delegated to state, local, or tribal agencies are specified in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section:
                (a) Approval of alternatives to the emission limitations in tables 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of this subpart and operating limits established under § 60.2675;
                (b) Approval of major alternatives to test methods;
                (c) Approval of major alternatives to monitoring;
                (d) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting;
                (e) The requirements in § 60.2680;
                (f) The requirements in § 60.2665(b)(2);
                (g) Approval of alternative opacity emission limits in § 60.2670 under § 60.11(e)(6) through (8);
                (h) Performance test and data reduction waivers under § 60.8(b)(4) and (5); and
                (i) Approval of an alternative to any electronic reporting to the EPA required by this subpart.
              
              
                
                § 60.2545
                Does this subpart directly affect CISWI owners and operators in my state?
                (a) No. This subpart does not directly affect CISWI owners and operators in your state. However, CISWI owners and operators must comply with the state plan you develop to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. States may choose to incorporate the model rule text directly in their state plan.
                (b) If you do not submit an approvable plan to implement and enforce the guidelines contained in this subpart for CISWIs that commenced construction before November 30, 1999 by December 2, 2002, EPA will implement and enforce a federal plan, as provided in § 60.2525, to ensure that each unit within your state reaches compliance with all the provisions of this subpart by December 1, 2005.
                (c) If you do not submit an approvable plan to implement and enforce the guidelines contained in this subpart by February 7, 2014, for CISWIs that commenced construction on or before June 4, 2010, EPA will implement and enforce a federal plan, as provided in § 60.2525, to ensure that each unit within your state that commenced construction on or before June 4, 2010, reaches compliance with all the provisions of this subpart by February 7, 2018.
              
            
            
              Applicability of State Plans
              
                § 60.2550
                What CISWIs must I address in my state plan?
                (a) Your state plan must address incineration units that meet all three criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section:
                (1) Commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units and ACIs in your state that commenced construction on or before June 4, 2010, or commenced modification or reconstruction after June 4, 2010 but no later than August 7, 2013;
                (2) Incineration units that meet the definition of a CISWI as defined in § 60.2875 or an ACI as defined in § 60.2875; and
                (3) Incineration units not exempt under § 60.2555.
                (b) If the owner or operator of a CISWI or ACI makes changes that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction after August 7, 2013, the CISWI or ACI becomes subject to subpart CCCC of this part and the state plan no longer applies to that unit.
                (c) If the owner or operator of a CISWI or ACI makes physical or operational changes to an existing CISWI or ACI primarily to comply with your state plan, subpart CCCC of this part does not apply to that unit. Such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under subpart CCCC of this part.
              
              
                § 60.2555

              Use of Model Rule
              
                § 60.2560
                What is the “model rule” in this subpart?
                (a) The model rule is the portion of these emission guidelines (§§ 60.2575 through 60.2875 of this part) that addresses the regulatory requirements applicable to CISWIs. The model rule provides these requirements in regulation format. You must develop a state plan that is at least as protective as the model rule. You may use the model rule language as part of your state plan. Alternative language may be used in your state plan if you demonstrate that the alternative language is at least as protective as the model rule contained in this subpart.
                (b) In the model rule of §§ 60.2575 to 60.2875, “you” means the owner or operator of a CISWI.
              
              
                § 60.2565
                How does the model rule relate to the required elements of my state plan?
                Use the model rule to satisfy the state plan requirements specified in § 60.2515(a)(4) and (5) of this part.
              
              
                
                § 60.2570
                What are the principal components of the model rule?
                The model rule contains the eleven major components listed in paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section:
                (a) Increments of progress toward compliance;
                (b) Waste management plan;
                (c) Operator training and qualification;
                (d) Emission limitations and operating limits;
                (e) Performance testing;
                (f) Initial compliance requirements;
                (g) Continuous compliance requirements;

                (2) Records showing the names of the CISWI operators who have completed the operator training requirements under § 60.2635, met the criteria for qualification under § 60.2645, and maintained or renewed their qualification under § 60.2650 or § 60.2655. Records must include documentation of training, the dates of the initial refresher training, and the dates of their qualification and all subsequent renewals of such qualifications; and
                (3) For each qualified operator, the phone and/or pager number at which they can be reached during operating hours.
              
              
                § 60.2665
                What if all the qualified operators are temporarily not accessible?

                If all qualified operators are temporarily not accessible (i.e., not at the facility and not able to be at the facility within 1 hour), you must meet one of the two criteria specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, depending on the length of time that a qualified operator is not accessible:
                (a) When all qualified operators are not accessible for more than 8 hours, but less than 2 weeks, the CISWI may be operated by other plant personnel familiar with the operation of the CISWI who have completed a review of the information specified in § 60.2660(a) within the past 12 months. However, you must record the period when all qualified operators were not accessible and include this deviation in the annual report as specified under § 60.2770;
                (b) When all qualified operators are not accessible for 2 weeks or more, you must take the two actions that are described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:
                (1) Notify the Administrator of this deviation in writing within 10 days. In the notice, state what caused this deviation, what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, and when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible; and
                (2) Submit a status report to the Administrator every 4 weeks outlining what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, stating when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible and requesting approval from the Administrator to continue operation of the CISWI. You must submit the first status report 4 weeks after you notify the Administrator of the deviation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the Administrator notifies you that your request to continue operation of the CISWI is disapproved, the CISWI may continue operation for 90 days, then must cease operation. Operation of the unit may resume if you meet the two requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:
                (i) A qualified operator is accessible as required under § 60.2635(a); and
                (ii) You notify the Administrator that a qualified operator is accessible and that you are resuming operation.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Emission Limitations and Operating Limits
              
                § 60.2670
                What emission limitations must I meet and by when?
                (a) You must meet the emission limitations for each CISWI, including bypass stack or vent, specified in table 2 of this subpart or tables 6 through 9 of this subpart by the final compliance date under the approved state plan, federal plan, or delegation, as applicable. The emission limitations apply at all times the unit is operating including and not limited to startup, shutdown, or malfunction.

                (b) Units that do not use wet scrubbers must maintain opacity to less than or equal to the percent opacity (three 1-hour blocks consisting of ten 6-minute average opacity values) specified in table 2 of this subpart, as applicable.
              
              
                § 60.2675
                What operating limits must I meet and by when?
                (a) If you use a wet scrubber(s) to comply with the emission limitations, you must establish operating limits for up to four operating parameters (as specified in table 3 of this subpart) as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial performance test:
                (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate:
                (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations; and
                (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
                (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet particulate matter scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average pressure drop across the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.
                (3) Minimum scrubber liquid flow rate, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquid flow rate at the inlet to the wet acid gas or particulate matter scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
                (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet acid gas scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride (HCl) emission limitation.
                (b) You must meet the operating limits established on the date that the performance test report is submitted to the EPA's Central Data Exchange or postmarked, per the requirements of § 60.2795(b).
                (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations and you do not use a particulate matter (PM) continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) for monitoring PM compliance, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. In calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.
                (d) If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limitations and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must measure the (secondary) voltage and amperage of the electrostatic precipitator collection plates during the particulate matter performance test. Calculate the average electric power value (secondary voltage × secondary current = secondary electric power) for each test run. The operating limit for the electrostatic precipitator is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average secondary electric power measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.

                (e) If you use activated carbon sorbent injection to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the sorbent flow rate during the performance testing. The operating limit for the carbon sorbent injection is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average sorbent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the mercury emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (e.g., for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).
                (f) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the charge rate, the secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI), and the reagent flow rate during the nitrogen oxides performance testing. The operating limits for the selective noncatalytic reduction are calculated as the highest 1-hour average charge rate, lowest secondary chamber temperature, and lowest reagent flow rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limitations.

                (g) If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations, you must measure the injection rate of each sorbent during the performance testing. The operating limit for the injection rate of each sorbent is calculated as the lowest 1-hour average injection rate of each sorbent measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride emission limitations. For energy recovery units, when your unit operates at lower loads, multiply your sorbent injection rate by the load fraction, as defined in this subpart, to determine the required injection rate (e.g., for 50 percent load, multiply the injection rate operating limit by 0.5).
                (h) If you do not use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations, and if you do not determine compliance with your particulate matter emission limitation with either a particulate matter CEMS or a particulate matter CPMS, you must maintain opacity to less than or equal to ten percent opacity (1-hour block average).
                (i) If you use a PM CPMS to demonstrate compliance, you must establish your PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section:

                (1) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record all hourly average output values (milliamps, or the digital signal equivalent) from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the test runs (e.g., three 1-hour average PM CPMS output values for three 1-hour test runs):
                (i) Your PM CPMS must provide a4-20 milliamp output, or the digital signal equivalent, and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps or digital bits;
                (ii) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit; and

                (iii) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values, or their digital equivalent, from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (e.g., average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour Method 5I test runs).
                (2) If the average of your three PM performance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS output values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or performance test with the procedures in (i)(1)through (5) of this section:
                (i) Determine your instrument zero output with one of the following procedures:
                (A) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench;
                (B) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air;

                (C) The zero point can also can be established obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept; and
                (D) If none of the steps in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.
                (ii) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 1:
                
                  ER16AP19.013
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  X1 = the PM CPMS output data points for the three runs constituting the performance test,
                  Y1 = the PM concentration value for the three runs constituting the performance test, and
                  n = the number of data points.
                
                
                (iii) With your instrument zero expressed in milliamps, or the digital equivalent, your three run average PM CPMS milliamp value, or its digital equivalent, and your three run average PM concentration from your three compliance tests, determine a relationship of mg/dscm per milliamp or digital signal equivalent, with equation 2:
                
                  ER16AP19.014
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  R = the relative mg/dscm per milliamp, or the digital equivalent, for your PM CPMS,
                  Y1 = the three run average mg/dscm PM concentration,
                  X1 = the three run average milliamp output, or the digital equivalent, from you PM CPMS, and
                  z = the milliamp or digital signal equivalent of your instrument zero determined from paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section.
                
                
                (iv) Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating limit using the mg/dscm per milliamp value, or per digital signal equivalent, from equation 2 in equation 3, below. This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of your emission limit:
                
                  
                  ER16AP19.015
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Ol = the operating limit for your PM CPMS on a 30-day rolling average, in milliamps or their digital signal equivalent,
                  L = your source emission limit expressed in mg/dscm,
                  z = your instrument zero in milliamps or digital equivalent, determined from paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, and
                  R = the relative mg/dscm per milliamp, or per digital signal output equivalent, for your PM CPMS, from equation 2.
                
                (3) If the average of your three PM compliance test runs is at or above 75 percent of your PM emission limit you must determine your operating limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp or digital signal output corresponding to your three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using equation 4 and you must submit all compliance test and PM CPMS data according to the reporting requirements in paragraph (i)(5) of this section:
                
                  ER16AP19.016
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  X1 = the PM CPMS data points for all runs i,
                  n = the number of data points, and
                  Oh = your site specific operating limit, in milliamps or digital signal equivalent.
                
                

                (4) To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (e.g., milliamps or digital signal bits, PM concentration, raw data signal) on a 30-day rolling average basis.

                (5) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (e.g., beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp or digital signal value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp or digital signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.
              
              
                § 60.2680
                What if I do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter, activated carbon injection, selective noncatalytic reduction, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations?

                (a) If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, activated carbon injection, selective noncatalytic reduction, fabric filter, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber or limit emissions in some other manner, including mass balances, to comply with the emission limitations under § 60.2670, you must petition the EPA Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must submit the petition at least sixty days before the performance test is scheduled to begin. Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section:
                (1) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as additional operating limits;
                (2) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters and how limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants;
                (3) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on these parameters;
                (4) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments; and
                (5) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.
                (b) [Reserved]
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Performance Testing
              
                § 60.2690
                How do I conduct the initial and annual performance test?
                (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations.
                (b) You must document that the waste burned during the performance test is representative of the waste burned under normal operating conditions by maintaining a log of the quantity of waste burned (as required in § 60.2740(b)(1)) and the types of waste burned during the performance test.
                (c) All performance tests must be conducted using the minimum run duration specified in tables 2 and 6 through 9 of this subpart.
                (d) Method 1 of appendix A of this part must be used to select the sampling location and number of traverse points.
                (e) Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used simultaneously with each method (except when using Method 9 and Method 22).
                (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using equation 5 of this section:
                
                  ER16AP19.017
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
                  Cmeas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis;
                  (20.9−7) = 20.9 percent oxygen−7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis);
                  20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
                  %O2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
                
                
                (g) You must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency by following the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octa-isomer emitted using EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A;
                (2) Quantify isomers meeting identification criteria 2, 3, 4, and 5 in Section 5.3.2.5 of Method 23, regardless of whether the isomers meet identification criteria 1 and 7. You must quantify the isomers per Section 9.0 of Method 23. [Note: You may reanalyze the sample aliquot or split to reduce the number of isomers not meeting identification criteria 1 or 7 of Section 5.3.2.5.];

                (3) For each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octa-chlorinated) isomer measured in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) and (2) of this section, multiply the isomer concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in table 4 of this subpart; and
                (4) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
                (h) Method 22 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 must be used to determine compliance with the fugitive ash emission limit in table 2 of this subpart or tables 6 through 9 of this subpart.
                (i) If you have an applicable opacity operating limit, you must determine compliance with the opacity limit using Method 9 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4, based on three 1-hour blocks consisting of ten 6-minute average opacity values, unless you are required to install a continuous opacity monitoring system, consistent with §§ 60.2710 and 60.2730.
                (j) You must determine dioxins/furans total mass basis by following the procedures in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octa-chlorinated isomer emitted using EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7;

You must quantify the isomers per Section 9.0 of Method 23. (Note: You may reanalyze the sample aliquot or split to reduce the number of isomers not meeting identification criteria 1 or 7 of Section 5.3.2.5.); and
                (3) Sum the quantities measured in accordance with paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of total mass basis.
              
              
                § 60.2695
                How are the performance test data used?
                You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations in table 2 of this subpart or tables 6 through 9 of this subpart.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Initial Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.2700
                How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the amended emission limitations and establish the operating limits?
                (a) You must conduct a performance test, as required under §§ 60.2670 and 60.2690, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in table 2 of this subpart and tables 6 through 9 of this subpart, to establish compliance with any opacity operating limits in § 60.2675, to establish the kiln-specific emission limit in § 60.2710(y), as applicable, and to establish operating limits using the procedures in § 60.2675 or § 60.2680. The performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 2 of this subpart and tables 6 through 9 of this subpart and the procedures in § 60.2690. The use of the bypass stack during a performance test shall invalidate the performance test.
                (b) As an alternative to conducting a performance test, as required under §§ 60.2690 and 60.2670, you may use a 30-day rolling average of the 1-hour arithmetic average CEMS data, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart or Tables 5 through 8 of this subpart. You must conduct a performance evaluation of each continuous monitoring system within 180 days of installation of the monitoring system. The initial performance evaluation must be conducted prior to collecting CEMS data that will be used for the initial compliance demonstration.
              
              
                § 60.2705
                By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?
                (a) The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 180 days after your final compliance date. Your final compliance date is specified in table 1 of this subpart.

                (b) If you commence or recommence combusting a solid waste at an existing combustion unit at any commercial or industrial facility and you conducted a test consistent with the provisions of this subpart while combusting the given solid waste within the 6 months preceding the reintroduction of that solid waste in the combustion chamber, you do not need to retest until 6 months from the date you reintroduce that solid waste.
                (c) If you commence or recommence combusting a solid waste at an existing combustion unit at any commercial or industrial facility and you have not conducted a performance test consistent with the provisions of this subpart while combusting the given solid waste within the 6 months preceding the reintroduction of that solid waste in the combustion chamber, you must conduct a performance test within 60 days from the date you reintroduce solid waste.
              
              
                § 60.2706
                By what date must I conduct the initial air pollution control device inspection?
                (a) The initial air pollution control device inspection must be conducted within 60 days after installation of the control device and the associated CISWI reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after the final compliance date for meeting the amended emission limitations.
                (b) Within 10 operating days following an air pollution control device inspection, all necessary repairs must be completed unless the owner or operator obtains written approval from the state agency establishing a date whereby all necessary repairs of the designated facility must be completed.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.2710
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the amended emission limitations and the operating limits?
                (a) General compliance with standards, considering some units may be able to switch between solid waste and non-waste fuel combustion, is specified in paragraph (a)(1) through (6) of this section.
                (1) The emission standards and operating requirements set forth in this subpart apply at all times.

                (2) If you cease combusting solid waste you may opt to remain subject to the provisions of this subpart. Consistent with the definition of CISWI, you are subject to the requirements of this subpart at least 6 months following the last date of solid waste combustion. Solid waste combustion is ceased when solid waste is not in the combustion chamber (i.e., the solid waste feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the solid waste residence time).
                (3) If you cease combusting solid waste you must be in compliance with any newly applicable standards on the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch is a date selected by you, that must be at least 6 months from the date that you ceased combusting solid waste, consistent with § 60.2710(a)(2). Your source must remain in compliance with this subpart until the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch.
                (4) If you own or operate an existing commercial or industrial combustion unit that combusted a fuel or non-waste material, and you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste, you are subject to the provisions of this subpart as of the first day you introduce or reintroduce solid waste to the combustion chamber, and this date constitutes the effective date of the fuel-to-waste switch. You must complete all initial compliance demonstrations for any Section 112 standards that are applicable to your facility before you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste. You must provide 30 days prior notice of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. The notification must identify:
                (i) The name of the owner or operator of the CISWI, the location of the source, the emissions unit(s) that will cease burning solid waste, and the date of the notice;
                (ii) The currently applicable subcategory under this subpart, and any 40 CFR part 63 subpart and subcategory that will be applicable after you cease combusting solid waste;
                (iii) The fuel(s), non-waste material(s) and solid waste(s) the CISWI is currently combusting and has combusted over the past 6 months, and the fuel(s) or non-waste materials the unit will commence combusting;

                (iv) The date on which you became subject to the currently applicable emission limits;
                

                (v) The date upon which you will cease combusting solid waste, and the date (if different) that you intend for any new requirements to become applicable (i.e., the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch), consistent with paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section.
                (5) All air pollution control equipment necessary for compliance with any newly applicable emissions limits which apply as a result of the cessation or commencement or recommencement of combusting solid waste must be installed and operational as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch.
                (6) All monitoring systems necessary for compliance with any newly applicable monitoring requirements which apply as a result of the cessation or commencement or recommencement of combusting solid waste must be installed and operational as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch. All calibration and drift checks must be performed as of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel, or fuel-to-waste switch. Relative accuracy tests must be performed as of the performance test deadline for PM CEMS (if PM CEMS are elected to demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter emission limits). Relative accuracy testing for other CEMS need not be repeated if that testing was previously performed consistent with section 112 monitoring requirements or monitoring requirements under this subpart.
                (b) You must conduct an annual performance test for the pollutants listed in table 2 of this subpart or tables 6 through 9 of this subpart and opacity for each CISWI as required under § 60.2690. The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 2 of this subpart or tables 6 through 9 of this subpart and the procedures in § 60.2690. Opacity must be measured using EPA Reference Method 9 at 40 CFR part 60. Annual performance tests are not required if you use CEMS or continuous opacity monitoring systems to determine compliance.
                (c) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in § 60.2675 or established under § 60.2680 and as specified in § 60.2735. Operation above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-hour block average values are used to determine compliance (except for baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging period is established under § 60.2680 or, for energy recovery units, where the averaging time for each operating parameter is a 30-day rolling, calculated each hour as the average of the previous 720 operating hours. Operation above the established maximum, below the established minimum, or outside the allowable range of the operating limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a deviation from your operating limits established under this subpart, except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission and operating limits or to establish new operating limits. Operating limits are confirmed or reestablished during performance tests.
                (d) You must burn only the same types of waste and fuels used to establish subcategory applicability (for ERUs) and operating limits during the performance test.
                (e) For energy recovery units, incinerators, and small remote units, you must perform annual visual emissions test for ash handling.
                (f) For energy recovery units, you must conduct an annual performance test for opacity using EPA Reference Method 9 at 40 CFR part 60 (except where particulate matter continuous monitoring system or CPMS are used) and the pollutants listed in table 7 of this subpart.
                (g) For facilities using a CEMS to demonstrate compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit, compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit may be demonstrated by using the CEMS, as described in § 60.2730(o).

                (h) Coal and liquid/gas energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than 250 MMBtu/hr may elect to demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter emissions limit using a particulate matter CEMS according to the procedures in § 60.2730(n) instead of the CPMS specified in § 60.2710(i). Coal and liquid/gas energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates less than 250 MMBtu/hr, incinerators, and small remote incinerators may also elect to demonstrate compliance using a particulate matter CEMS according to the procedures in § 60.2730(n) instead of particulate matter testing with EPA Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 and, if applicable, the continuous opacity monitoring requirements in paragraph (i) of this section.
                (i) For energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than or equal to 10 MMBtu/hr but less than 250 MMBtu/hr that do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter with bag leak detection system, an electrostatic precipitator, particulate matter CEMS, or particulate matter CPMS, you must install, operate, certify and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) according to the procedures in § 60.2730(m).
                (j) For waste-burning kilns, you must conduct an annual performance test for the pollutants (except mercury and particulate matter, and hydrogen chloride if no acid gas wet scrubber or dry scrubber is used) listed in table 8 of this subpart, unless you choose to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance using CEMS, as allowed in paragraph (u) of this section. If you do not use an acid gas wet scrubber or dry scrubber, you must determine compliance with the hydrogen chloride emissions limit using a HCl CEMS according to the requirements in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. You must determine compliance with the mercury emissions limit using a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system according to paragraph (j)(2) of this section. You must determine compliance with particulate matter using CPMS.
                (1) If you monitor compliance with the HCl emissions limit by operating an HCl CEMS, you must do so in accordance with Performance Specification 15 (PS 15) of appendix B to 40 CFR part 60, or, PS 18 of appendix B to 40 CFR part 60. You must operate, maintain, and quality assure a HCl CEMS installed and certified under PS 15 according to the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 60 except that the Relative Accuracy Test Audit requirements of Procedure 1 must be replaced with the validation requirements and criteria of sections 11.1.1 and 12.0 of PS 15. You must operate, maintain and quality assure a HCl CEMS installed and certified under PS 18 according to the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 6 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 60. For any performance specification that you use, you must use Method 321 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 63 as the reference test method for conducting relative accuracy testing. The span value and calibration requirements in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to all HCl CEMS used under this subpart:
                (i) You must use a measurement span value for any HCl CEMS of 0-10 ppmvw unless the monitor is installed on a kiln without an inline raw mill. Kilns without an inline raw mill may use a higher span value sufficient to quantify all expected emissions concentrations. The HCl CEMS data recorder output range must include the full range of expected HCl concentration values which would include those expected during “mill off” conditions. The corresponding data recorder range shall be documented in the site-specific monitoring plan and associated records; and
                (ii) In order to quality assure data measured above the span value, you must use one of the three options in paragraphs (j)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section:
                (A) Include a second span that encompasses the HCl emission concentrations expected to be encountered during “mill off” conditions. This second span may be rounded to a multiple of 5 ppm of total HCl. The requirements of the appropriate HCl monitor performance specification shall be followed for this second span with the exception that a RATA with the mill off is not required;

                (B) Quality assure any data above the span value by proving instrument linearity beyond the span value established in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section using the following procedure. Conduct a weekly “above span linearity” calibration challenge of the monitoring system using a reference gas with a certified value greater than your highest expected hourly concentration or greater than 75% of the highest measured hourly concentration. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of the applicable performance specification and must be introduced to the measurement system at the probe. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The “above span linearity” challenge is successful if the value measured by the HCl CEMS falls within 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the HCl CEMS during the above span linearity challenge exceeds 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, the monitoring system must be evaluated and repaired and a new “above span linearity” challenge met before returning the HCl CEMS to service, or data above span from the HCl CEMS must be subject to the quality assurance procedures established in (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. In this manner values measured by the HCl CEMS during the above span linearity challenge exceeding ±20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas must be normalized using equation 6;
                (C) Quality assure any data above the span value established in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section using the following procedure. Any time two consecutive one-hour average measured concentration of HCl exceeds the span value you must, within 24 hours before or after, introduce a higher, “above span” HCl reference gas standard to the HCl CEMS. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of the applicable performance specification and target a concentration level between 50 and 150 percent of the highest expected hourly concentration measured during the period of measurements above span, and must be introduced at the probe. While this target represents a desired concentration range that is not always achievable in practice, it is expected that the intent to meet this range is demonstrated by the value of the reference gas. Expected values may include above span calibrations done before or after the above-span measurement period. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The “above span” calibration is successful if the value measured by the HCl CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the HCl CEMS is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, then you must normalize the stack gas values measured above span as described in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. If the “above span” calibration is conducted during the period when measured emissions are above span and there is a failure to collect the one data point in an hour due to the calibration duration, then you must determine the emissions average for that missed hour as the average of hourly averages for the hour preceding the missed hour and the hour following the missed hour. In an hour where an “above span” calibration is being conducted and one or more data points are collected, the emissions average is represented by the average of all valid data points collected in that hour; and

                (D) In the event that the “above span” calibration is not successful (i.e., the HCl CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the “above span” calibration for reporting based on the HCl CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in equation 6:
                
                  ER16AP19.018
                
                Only one “above span” calibration is needed per 24-hour period.

Alternatively, install and verify the operation of a new pressure sensor.
                (o) If you have an operating limit that requires a pH monitoring system, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (l) and (o)(1) through (4) of this section:

The sulfur dioxide CEMS must follow the procedures and methods specified in paragraph (s) of this section. For sources that have actual inlet emissions less than 100 parts per million dry volume, the relative accuracy criterion for inlet sulfur dioxide CEMS should be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the reference method test data in terms of the units of the emission standard, or 5 parts per million dry volume absolute value of the mean difference between the reference method and the CEMS, whichever is greater:
                (1) During each relative accuracy test run of the CEMS required by performance specification 2 in appendix B of this part, collect sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data concurrently (or within a 30- to 60-minute period) with both the CEMS and the test methods specified in paragraphs (s)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:
                (i) For sulfur dioxide, EPA Reference Method 6 or 6C, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) must be used; and
                (ii) For oxygen (or carbon dioxide), EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), as applicable, must be used.

                (4) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. If carbon dioxide is selected for use in diluent corrections, the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels must be established during the initial performance test according to the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (t)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section. This relationship may be reestablished during performance compliance tests:
                (i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B must be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3A, 3B, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), as applicable, must be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor;
                (ii) Samples must be taken for at least 30 minutes in each hour;
                (iii) Each sample must represent a 1-hour average; and
                (iv) A minimum of 3 runs must be performed.
                (u) For facilities using a CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for mercury to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with any of the emission limits of this subpart, you must complete the following:
                (1) Demonstrate compliance with the appropriate emission limit(s) using a 30-day rolling average of 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at appendix A-7 of this part. The 1-hour arithmetic averages for CEMS must be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2). Except for CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system data during startup and shutdown, the 1-hour arithmetic averages used to calculate the 30-day rolling average emission concentrations must be corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis). Integrated sorbent trap monitoring system or CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content; and
                (2) Operate all CEMS and integrated sorbent trap monitoring systems in accordance with the applicable procedures under appendices B and F of this part.
                (v) Use of the bypass stack at any time is an emissions standards deviation for PM, HCl, lead, cadmium, mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and dioxin/furans.
                (w) For energy recovery units with a design heat input capacity of 100 MMBtu/hr or greater that do not use a carbon monoxide CEMS, you must install, operate, and maintain an oxygen analyzer system as defined in § 60.2875 according to the procedures in paragraphs (w)(1) through (4) of this section:
                (1) The oxygen analyzer system must be installed by the initial performance test date specified in § 60.2675;
                (2) You must operate the oxygen trim system within compliance with paragraph (w)(3) of this section at all times;

                (3) You must maintain the oxygen level such that the 30-day rolling average that is established as the operating limit for oxygen is not below the lowest hourly average oxygen concentration measured during the most recent CO performance test; and
                
                (4) You must calculate and record a 30-day rolling average oxygen concentration using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.

                (x) For energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than or equal to 250 MMBtu/hr and waste-burning kilns, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a PM CPMS and record the output of the system as specified in paragraphs (x)(1) through (8) of this section. For other energy recovery units, you may elect to use PM CPMS operated in accordance with this section. PM CPMS are suitable in lieu of using other CMS for monitoring PM compliance (e.g., bag leak detectors, ESP secondary power, PM scrubber pressure):
                (1) Install, calibrate, operate, and maintain your PM CPMS according to the procedures in your approved site-specific monitoring plan developed in accordance with paragraphs (l) and (x)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
                (i) The operating principle of the PM CPMS must be based on in-stack or extractive light scatter, light scintillation, beta attenuation, or mass accumulation of the exhaust gas or representative sample. The reportable measurement output from the PM CPMS must be expressed as milliamps or the digital signal equivalent;
                (ii) The PM CPMS must have a cycle time (i.e., period required to complete sampling, measurement, and reporting for each measurement) no longer than 60 minutes; and
                (iii) The PM CPMS must be capable of detecting and responding to particulate matter concentrations increments no greater than 0.5 mg/actual cubic meter.
                (2) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, you must adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test according to the procedures specified in § 60.2675.
                (3) Collect PM CPMS hourly average output data for all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours. Express the PM CPMS output as milliamps or the digital signal equivalent.
                (4) Calculate the arithmetic 30-day rolling average of all of the hourly average PM CPMS output collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours data (milliamps or their digital equivalent).
                (5) You must collect data using the PM CPMS at all times the energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (x)(1)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (6) You must use all the data collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:
                (i) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions are not used in calculations (report any such periods in your annual deviation report);
                (ii) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during out-of-control periods are not used in calculations (report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report);
                (iii) Any PM CPMS data recorded during periods of CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart.

                (7) You must record and make available upon request results of PM CPMS system performance audits, as well as the dates and duration of periods from when the PM CPMS is out of control until completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the PM CPMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (8) For any deviation of the 30-day rolling average PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit, you must:
                (i) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;
                (ii) If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value;
                (iii) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit. Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under paragraph (x) of this section; and
                (iv) PM CPMS deviations leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a violation of this subpart.
                (y) When there is an alkali bypass and/or an in-line coal mill that exhaust emissions through a separate stack(s), the combined emissions are subject to the emission limits applicable to waste-burning kilns. To determine the kiln-specific emission limit for demonstrating compliance, you must:
                (1) Calculate a kiln-specific emission limit using equation 7:
                
                  ER16AP19.019
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cks = Kiln stack concentration (ppmvd, mg/dscm, ng/dscm, depending on pollutant. Each corrected to 7% O2.)
                  Qab = Alkali bypass flow rate (volume/hr)
                  Cab = Alkali bypass concentration (ppmvd, mg/dscm, ng/dscm, depending on pollutant. Each corrected to 7% O2.)
                  Qcm = In-line coal mill flow rate (volume/hr)
                  Ccm = In-line coal mill concentration (ppmvd, mg/dscm, ng/dscm, depending on pollutant. Each corrected to 7% O2.)
                  Qks = Kiln stack flow rate (volume/hr)
                
                
                (2) Particulate matter concentration must be measured downstream of the in-line coal mill. All other pollutant concentrations must be measured either upstream or downstream of the in-line coal mill.
                (3) For purposes of determining the combined emissions from kilns equipped with an alkali bypass or that exhaust kiln gases to a coal mill that exhausts through a separate stack, instead of installing a CEMS or PM CPMS on the alkali bypass stack or in-line coal mill stack, the results of the initial and subsequent performance test can be used to demonstrate compliance with the relevant emissions limit. A performance test must be conducted on an annual basis (between 11 and 13 calendar months following the previous performance test).
              
              
                § 60.2715
                By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?
                You must conduct annual performance tests between 11 and 13 calendar months of the previous performance test.
              
              
                § 60.2716
                By what date must I conduct the annual air pollution control device inspection?
                On an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous annual air pollution control device inspection), you must complete the air pollution control device inspection as described in § 60.2706.
              
              
                § 60.2720
                May I conduct performance testing less often?
                (a) You must conduct annual performance tests according to the schedule specified in § 60.2715, with the following exceptions:

                (1) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits, as specified in § 60.2725. New operating limits become effective on the date that the performance test report is submitted to the EPA's Central Data Exchange or postmarked, per the requirements of § 60.2795(b). The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time;
                (2) You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process change, as defined in § 60.2875; and
                (3) You can conduct performance tests less often if you meet the following conditions: Your performance tests for the pollutant for at least 2 consecutive performance tests demonstrates that the emission level for the pollutant is no greater than the emission level specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable; there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions; and you are not required to conduct a performance test for the pollutant in response to a request by the Administrator in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a process change in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test for the pollutant no more than 37 months following the previous performance test for the pollutant. If the emission level for your CISWI continues to meet the emission level specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year, as long as there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions. Each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
                (i) For particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, mercury, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and dioxins/furans, the emission level equal to 75 percent of the applicable emission limit in table 2 or tables 6 through 9 of this subpart, as applicable; and
                (ii) For fugitive emissions, visible emissions (of combustion ash from the ash conveying system) for 2 percent of the time during each of the three 1-hour observation periods.
                (4) If you are conducting less frequent testing for a pollutant as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and a subsequent performance test for the pollutant indicates that your CISWI does not meet the emission level specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section, as applicable, you must conduct annual performance tests for the pollutant according to the schedule specified in paragraph (a) of this section until you qualify for less frequent testing for the pollutant as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
                (b) [Reserved]
              
              
                § 60.2725
                May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish new operating limits?
                (a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
                (b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to demonstrate compliance.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Monitoring
              
                § 60.2730
                What monitoring equipment must I install and what parameters must I monitor?
                (a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitation under § 60.2670, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in table 3 of this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in table 3 of this subpart at all times except as specified in § 60.2735(a).

                (b) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the requirements of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS or PM CEMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate a bag leak detection system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section:
                (1) You must install and operate a bag leak detection system for each exhaust stack of the fabric filter;
                (2) Each bag leak detection system must be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations;
                (3) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter or less;
                (4) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative or absolute particulate matter loadings;
                (5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor;
                (6) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will alert automatically an operator when an increase in relative particulate matter emission over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is observed easily by plant operating personnel;
                (7) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detection system must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell. For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter; and
                (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
                (c) If you are using something other than a wet scrubber, activated carbon, selective non-catalytic reduction, an electrostatic precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under § 60.2670, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established using the procedures in § 60.2680.
                (d) If you use activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart, you must measure the minimum sorbent flow rate once per hour.
                (e) If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the emission limitations, you must complete the following:
                (1) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.2690, whichever date comes first, ensure that the affected facility does not operate above the maximum charge rate, or below the minimum secondary chamber temperature (if applicable to your CISWI) or the minimum reagent flow rate measured as 3-hour block averages at all times; and
                (2) Operation of the affected facility above the maximum charge rate, below the minimum secondary chamber temperature and below the minimum reagent flow rate simultaneously constitute a violation of the nitrogen oxides emissions limit.
                (f) If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the emission limits of this subpart and you do not use a PM CPMS for monitoring PM compliance, you must monitor the secondary power to the electrostatic precipitator collection plates and maintain the 3-hour block averages at or above the operating limits established during the mercury or particulate matter performance test.

                (g) For waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring hydrogen chloride emissions discharged to the atmosphere, as specified in § 60.2710(j), and record the output of the system. You may substitute use of a HCl CEMS for conducting the HCl initial and annual testing with EPA Method 321 at 40 CFR part 63, appendix A. For units other than waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, a facility may substitute use of a hydrogen chloride CEMS for conducting the hydrogen chloride initial and annual performance test. For units equipped with a hydrogen chloride CEMS, you are not required to monitor the minimum hydrogen chloride sorbent flow rate, monitoring the minimum scrubber liquor pH, and monitoring minimum injection rate.

                (h) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of either a particulate matter CEMS or a particulate matter CPMS for conducting the particulate matter annual performance test. For units equipped with a particulate matter CEMS, you are not required to use other CMS monitoring for PM compliance (e.g., bag leak detectors, ESP secondary power, PM scrubber pressure). A facility may also substitute use of a particulate matter CEMS for conducting the PM initial performance test.

                (i) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the dioxin/furan emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a continuous automated sampling system for the dioxin/furan initial and annual performance test. You must record the output of the system and analyze the sample according to EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to dioxin/furan from continuous monitors is published in the Federal Register. The owner or operator who elects to continuously sample dioxin/furan emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous automated sampling system and must comply with the requirements specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q). A facility may substitute continuous dioxin/furan monitoring for the minimum sorbent flow rate, if activated carbon sorbent injection is used solely for compliance with the dioxin/furan emission limit.
                (j) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the mercury emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a mercury CEMS or and integrated sorbent trap monitoring system for the mercury initial and annual performance test. The owner or operator who elects to continuously measure mercury emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Method 29 or 30B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, ASTM D6784-02 (Reapproved 2008) (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or an approved alternative method for measuring mercury emissions, must install, calibrate, maintain and operate the mercury CEMS or integrated sorbent trap monitoringsystem and must comply with performance specification 12A or performance specification 12B, respectively, and quality assurance procedure 5. For the purposes of emissions calculations when using an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, the mercury concentration determined for each sampling period must be assigned to each hour during the sampling period. For units equipped with a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system, you are not required to monitor the minimum sorbent flow rate, if activated carbon sorbent injection is used solely for compliance with the mercury emission limit. Waste-burning kilns must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a mercury CEMS or an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system as specified in § 60.2710(j).
                (k) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the nitrogen oxides emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a CEMS for the nitrogen oxides initial and annual performance test to demonstrate compliance with the nitrogen oxides emissions limits. For units equipped with a nitrogen xides CEMS, you are not required to monitor the charge rate, secondary chamber temperature and reagent flow for selective noncatalytic reduction, if applicable:
                (1) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate a CEMS for measuring nitrogen oxides emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The requirements under performance specification 2 of appendix B of this part, the quality assurance procedure 1 of appendix F of this part and the procedures under § 60.13 must be followed for installation, evaluation and operation of the CEMS; and

                (2) Compliance with the emission limit for nitrogen oxides must be determined based on the 30-day rolling average of the hourly emission concentrations using CEMS outlet data, as outlined in § 60.2710(u).
                
                (l) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the sulfur dioxide emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a CEMS for the sulfur dioxide initial and annual performance test to demonstrate compliance with the sulfur dioxide emissions limits:
                (1) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate a CEMS for measuring sulfur dioxide emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The requirements under performance specification 2 of appendix B of this part, the quality assurance requirements of procedure 1 of appendix F of this part and the procedures under § 60.13 must be followed for installation, evaluation and operation of the CEMS; and
                (2) Compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limit shall be determined based on the 30-day rolling average of the hourly arithmetic average emission concentrations using CEMS outlet data, as outlined in § 60.2710(u).
                (m) For energy recovery units over 10 MMBtu/hr but less than 250 MMBtu/hr annual average heat input rates that do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter with bag leak detection system, an electrostatic precipitator, particulate matter CEMS, or particulate matter CPMS, you must install, operate, certify and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system according to the procedures in paragraphs (m)(1) through (5) of this section by the compliance date specified in § 60.2670. Energy recovery units that use a particulate matter CEMS to demonstrate initial and continuing compliance according to the procedures in § 60.2730(n) are not required to install a continuous opacity monitoring system and must perform the annual performance tests for opacity consistent with § 60.2710(f):
                (1) Install, operate and maintain each continuous opacity monitoring system according to performance specification 1 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B;
                (2) Conduct a performance evaluation of each continuous opacity monitoring system according to the requirements in § 60.13 and according to performance specification 1 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B;
                (3) As specified in § 60.13(e)(1), each continuous opacity monitoring system must complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period;
                (4) Reduce the continuous opacity monitoring system data as specified in § 60.13(h)(1); and
                (5) Determine and record all the 6-minute averages (and 1-hour block averages as applicable) collected.
                (n) For coal and liquid/gas energy recovery units, incinerators, and small remote incinerators, an owner or operator may elect to install, calibrate, maintain and operate a CEMS for monitoring particulate matter emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an affected facility who continuously monitors particulate matter emissions instead of conducting performance testing using EPA Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 or monitoring with a particulate matter CPMS according to paragraph (r) of this section, must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a PM CEMS and must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (n)(1) through (10) of this section:
                (1) The PM CEMS must be installed, evaluated and operated in accordance with the requirements of performance specification 11 of appendix B of this part and quality assurance requirements of procedure 2 of appendix F of this part and § 60.13;
                (2) The initial performance evaluation must be completed no later than 180 days after the final compliance date for meeting the amended emission limitations, as specified under § 60.2690 or within 180 days of notification to the Administrator of use of the continuous monitoring system if the owner or operator was previously determining compliance by Method 5 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 performance tests, whichever is later;

                (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the particulate matter emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. The relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels for the affected facility must be established according to the procedures and methods specified in § 60.2710(t)(4)(i) through (iv);
                (4) The owner or operator of an affected facility must conduct an initial performance test for particulate matter emissions. If PM CEMS are elected for demonstrating compliance, and the initial performance test has not yet been conducted, then initial compliance must be determined by using the CEMS specified in paragraph (n) of this section to measure particulate matter. You must calculate a 30-day rolling average of 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 of this part;
                (5) Continuous compliance with the particulate matter emission limit must be determined based on the 30-day rolling average calculated using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 of the part from the 1-hour arithmetic average of the CEMS outlet data.
                (6) At a minimum, valid continuous monitoring system hourly averages must be obtained as specified § 60.2735;
                (7) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required under paragraph (n)(5) of this section must be expressed in milligrams per dry standard cubic meter corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide)(dry basis) and must be used to calculate the 30-day rolling average emission concentrations. CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart, are not corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and are measured at stack oxygen content. The 1-hour arithmetic averages must be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2);
                (8) All valid CEMS data must be used in calculating average emission concentrations even if the minimum CEMS data requirements of paragraph (n)(6) of this section are not met;
                (9) The CEMS must be operated according to performance specification 11 in appendix B of this part; and,
                (10) Quarterly and yearly accuracy audits and daily drift, system optics, and sample volume checks must be performed in accordance with procedure 2 in appendix F of this part.
                (o) To demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a CEMS for the carbon monoxide initial and annual performance test to demonstrate compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limits:
                (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring carbon monoxide emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The requirements under performance specification 4A or 4B of appendix B of this part, the quality assurance procedure 1 of appendix F of this part and the procedures under § 60.13 must be followed for installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS; and
                (2) Compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit shall be determined based on the 30-day rolling average of the hourly arithmetic average emission concentrations, including CEMS data during startup and shutdown as defined in this subpart, using CEMS outlet data, as outlined in § 60.2710(u).
                (p) The owner/operator of an affected source with a bypass stack shall install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate a device or method for measuring the use of the bypass stack including date, time and duration.
                (q) For energy recovery units with a heat input capacity of 100 MMBtu/hr or greater that do not use a carbon monoxide CEMS, you must install, operate and maintain the continuous oxygen monitoring system as defined in § 60.2875 according to the procedures in paragraphs (q)(1) through (4) of this section:
                (1) The oxygen analyzer system must be installed by the initial performance test date specified in § 60.2675;
                (2) You must operate the oxygen trim system within compliance with paragraph (q)(3) of this section at all times;

                (3) You must maintain the oxygen level such that the 30-day rolling average that is established as the operating limit for oxygen according to paragraph (q)(4) of this section is not below the lowest hourly average oxygen concentration measured during the most recent CO performance test; and
                
                (4) You must calculate and record a 30-day rolling average oxygen concentration using equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.

                (r) For energy recovery units with annual average heat input rates greater than or equal to 250 MMBtu/hr and waste-burning kilns, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a PM CPMS and record the output of the system as specified in paragraphs (r)(1) through (8) of this section. For other energy recovery units, you may elect to use PM CPMS operated in accordance with this section. PM CPMS are suitable in lieu of using other CMS for monitoring PM compliance (e.g., bag leak detectors, ESP secondary power, PM scrubber pressure):
                (1) Install, calibrate, operate, and maintain your PM CPMS according to the procedures in your approved site-specific monitoring plan developed in accordance with § 60.2710(l) and (r)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
                (i) The operating principle of the PM CPMS must be based on in-stack or extractive light scatter, light scintillation, beta attenuation, or mass accumulation of the exhaust gas or representative sample. The reportable measurement output from the PM CPMS must be expressed as milliamps or the digital signal equivalent;
                (ii) The PM CPMS must have a cycle time (i.e., period required to complete sampling, measurement, and reporting for each measurement) no longer than 60 minutes; and
                (iii) The PM CPMS must be capable of detecting and responding to particulate matter concentrations increments no greater than 0.5 mg/actual cubic meter.
                (2) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, you must adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test according to the procedures specified in § 60.2675.
                (3) Collect PM CPMS hourly average output data for all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours. Express the PM CPMS output as milliamps or the digital signal equivalent.
                (4) Calculate the arithmetic 30-day rolling average of all of the hourly average PM CPMS output collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours data (milliamps or digital bits).
                (5) You must collect data using the PM CPMS at all times the energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (6) You must use all the data collected during all energy recovery unit or waste-burning kiln operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:
                (i) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions are not used in calculations (report any such periods in your annual deviation report);
                (ii) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities conducted during out-of-control periods are not used in calculations (report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report); and
                (iii) Any PM CPMS data recorded during periods of CEMS data during startup and shutdown, as defined in this subpart.

                (7) You must record and make available upon request results of PM CPMS system performance audits, as well as the dates and duration of periods from when the PM CPMS is out of control until completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the PM CPMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (8) For any deviation of the 30-day rolling average PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit, you must:
                (i) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device;
                (ii) If inspection of the air pollution control device identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value;
                (iii) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit and to verify the operation of the emissions control device(s). Within 45 days of the deviation, you must re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under this paragraph; and
                (iv) PM CPMS deviations leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month process operating period (rolling monthly) constitute a violation of this subpart.
                (s) If you use a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limits of this subpart, you must monitor the injection rate of each sorbent and maintain the 3-hour block averages at or above the operating limits established during the hydrogen chloride performance test.
                (t) If you are required to monitor clinker production because you comply with the production-rate based mercury limit for your waste-burning kiln, you must:
                (1) Determine hourly clinker production by one of two methods:
                (i) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates in tons-mass per hour of the amount of clinker produced. The system of measuring hourly clinker production must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy, or
                (ii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates in tons-mass per hour of the amount of feed to the kiln. The system of measuring feed must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy. Calculate your hourly clinker production rate using a kiln-specific feed to clinker ratio based on reconciled clinker production determined for accounting purposes and recorded feed rates. Update this ratio monthly. Note that if this ratio changes at clinker reconciliation, you must use the new ratio going forward, but you do not have to retroactively change clinker production rates previously estimated.
                (2) Determine the accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production (or feed mass flow if applicable) before the final compliance date of this rule and during each quarter of source operation.
                (3) Conduct accuracy checks in accordance with the procedures outlined in your site-specific monitoring plan under § 60.2710(l).
              
              
                § 60.2735
                Is there a minimum amount of monitoring data I must obtain?
                For each continuous monitoring system required or optionally allowed under § 60.2730, you must monitor and collect data according to this section:

                (a) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times compliance is required except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods (as specified in § 60.2770(o)), and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to effect monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
                (b) You may not use data recorded during the monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of control periods, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use all the data collected during all other periods, including data normalized for above scale readings, in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
                (c) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments, failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements.

The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph; and

                (ii) For data collected using test methods that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the test, you must submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 60.4.
                (2) Within 60 days after the date of completing each continuous emissions monitoring system performance evaluation you must submit the results of the performance evaluation following the procedure specified in either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section:
                (i) For performance evaluations of continuous monitoring systems measuring relative accuracy test audit (RATA) pollutants that are supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the evaluation, you must submit the results of the performance evaluation to the EPA via the CEDRI. CEDRI can be accessed through the EPA's CDX. Performance evaluation data must be submitted in a file format generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate file format consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website. If you claim that some of the performance evaluation information being submitted is CBI, you must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic storage media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph; and
                (ii) For any performance evaluations of continuous monitoring systems measuring RATA pollutants that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the evaluation, you must submit the results of the performance evaluation to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 60.4.
                (c) If you are required to electronically submit a report through the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) in the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX), and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date, time and length of the outage; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

                (d) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (e.g., large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

For each shutdown event, the length of time that CEMS data may be claimed as being CEMS data during shutdown must be 24 operating hours or less;
                (2) For energy recovery units: CEMS data collected during the startup or shutdown periods of operation. Startup begins with either the first-ever firing of fuel in a boiler or process heater for the purpose of supplying useful thermal energy (such as steam or heat) for heating, cooling or process purposes, or producing electricity, or the firing of fuel in a boiler or process heater for any purpose after a shutdown event. Startup ends four hours after when the boiler or process heater makes useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) for heating, cooling, or process purposes, or generates electricity, whichever is earlier. Shutdown begins when the boiler or process heater no longer makes useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) for heating, cooling, or process purposes and/or generates electricity or when no fuel is being fed to the boiler or process heater, whichever is earlier. Shutdown ends when the boiler or process heater no longer makes useful thermal energy (such as steam or heat) for heating, cooling, or process purposes and/or generates electricity, and no fuel is being combusted in the boiler or process heater; and
                (3) For waste-burning kilns: CEMS data collected during the periods of kiln operation that do not include normal operations. Startup means the time from when a shutdown kiln first begins firing fuel until it begins producing clinker. Startup begins when a shutdown kiln turns on the induced draft fan and begins firing fuel in the main burner. Startup ends when feed is being continuously introduced into the kiln for at least 120 minutes or when the feed rate exceeds 60 percent of the kiln design limitation rate, whichever occurs first. Shutdown means the cessation of kiln operation. Shutdown begins when feed to the kiln is halted and ends when continuous kiln rotation ceases.
                
                  Chemical recovery unit means combustion units burning materials to recover chemical constituents or to produce chemical compounds where there is an existing commercial market for such recovered chemical constituents or compounds.

                  Chemotherapeutic waste means waste material resulting from the production or use of antineoplastic agents used for the purpose of stopping or reversing the growth of malignant cells.
                
                  Clean lumber means wood or wood products that have been cut or shaped and include wet, air-dried, and kiln-dried wood products. Clean lumber does not include wood products that have been painted, pigment-stained, or pressure-treated by compounds such as chromate copper arsenate, pentachlorophenol, and creosote.
                
                  Commercial and industrial solid waste incineration unit (CISWI) means any distinct operating unit of any commercial or industrial facility that combusts, or has combusted in the preceding 6 months, any solid waste as that term is defined in 40 CFR part 241. If the operating unit burns materials other than traditional fuels as defined in § 241.2 that have been discarded, and you do not keep and produce records as required by § 60.2740(u), the operating unit is a CISWI. While not all CISWIs will include all of the following components, a CISWI includes, but is not limited to, the solid waste feed system, grate system, flue gas system, waste heat recovery equipment, if any, and bottom ash system. The CISWI does not include air pollution control equipment or the stack. The CISWI boundary starts at the solid waste hopper (if applicable) and extends through two areas: The combustion unit flue gas system, which ends immediately after the last combustion chamber or after the waste heat recovery equipment, if any; and the combustion unit bottom ash system, which ends at the truck loading station or similar equipment that transfers the ash to final disposal. The CISWI includes all ash handling systems connected to the bottom ash handling system.
                
                  Contained gaseous material means gases that are in a container when that container is combusted.

                  Continuous monitoring system (CMS) means the total equipment, required under the emission monitoring sections in applicable subparts, used to sample and condition (if applicable), to analyze, and to provide a permanent record of emissions or process parameters. A particulate matter continuous parameter monitoring system (PM CPMS) is a type of CMS.
                
                  Cyclonic burn barrel means a combustion device for waste materials that is attached to a 55 gallon, open-head drum. The device consists of a lid, which fits onto and encloses the drum, and a blower that forces combustion air into the drum in a cyclonic manner to enhance the mixing of waste material and air. A cyclonic burn barrel is not an incinerator, a waste-burning kiln, an energy recovery unit or a small, remote incinerator under this subpart.
                
                  Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
                (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including but not limited to any emission limitation, operating limit, or operator qualification and accessibility requirements; and
                (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit.

              Introduction
              
                § 60.2880
                What does this subpart do?
                This subpart establishes new source performance standards for other solid waste incineration (OSWI) units. Other solid waste incineration units are very small municipal waste combustion units and institutional waste incineration units.
              
              
                § 60.2881
                When does this subpart become effective?
                This subpart takes effect June 16, 2006. Some of the requirements in this subpart apply to planning the incineration unit and must be completed even before construction is initiated on the unit (i.e., the preconstruction requirements in §§ 60.2894 and 60.2895). Other requirements such as the emission limitations and operating limits apply when the unit begins operation.

                § 60.2899
                What is a waste management plan?
                A waste management plan is a written plan that identifies both the feasibility and the methods used to reduce or separate certain components of solid waste from the waste stream in order to reduce or eliminate toxic emissions from incinerated waste.
              
              
                § 60.2900
                When must I submit my waste management plan?
                You must submit a waste management plan prior to commencing construction, reconstruction, or modification.
              
              
                § 60.2901
                What should I include in my waste management plan?
                A waste management plan must include consideration of the reduction or separation of waste-stream elements such as paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, batteries, or metals; or the use of recyclable materials. The plan must identify any additional waste management measures and implement those measures the source considers practical and feasible, considering the effectiveness of waste management measures already in place, the costs of additional measures, the emissions reductions expected to be achieved, and any other environmental or energy impacts they might have.

                (e) Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used simultaneously with each method.
                (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 in “60.2975.
                (g) Method 26A of appendix A of this part must be used for hydrogen chloride concentration analysis, with the additional requirements specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) The probe and filter must be conditioned prior to sampling using the procedure described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) Assemble the sampling train(s) and conduct a conditioning run by collecting between 14 liters per minute (0.5 cubic feet per minute) and 30 liters per minute (1.0 cubic feet per minute) of gas over a one-hour period. Follow the sampling procedures outlined in section 8.1.5 of Method 26A of appendix A of this part. For the conditioning run, water can be used as the impinger solution.
                (ii) Remove the impingers from the sampling train and replace with a fresh impinger train for the sampling run, leaving the probe and filter (and cyclone, if used) in position. Do not recover the filter or rinse the probe before the first run. Thoroughly rinse the impingers used in the preconditioning run with deionized water and discard these rinses.
                (iii) The probe and filter assembly are conditioned by the stack gas and are not recovered or cleaned until the end of testing.
                (2) For the duration of sampling, a temperature around the probe and filter (and cyclone, if used) between 120 °C (248 °F) and 134 °C (273 °F) must be maintained.
                (3) If water droplets are present in the sample gas stream, the requirements specified in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section must be met.
                (i) The cyclone described in section 6.1.4 of Method 26A of appendix A of this part must be used.
                (ii) The post-test moisture removal procedure described in section 8.1.6 of Method 26A of appendix A of this part must be used.
              
              
                § 60.2923
                How are the performance test data used?
                You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations in table 1 of this subpart.
              
            
            
              
              Initial Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.2927
                How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations and establish the operating limits?
                You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under § 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in table 1 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the procedure in § 60.2916 or § 60.2917. The initial performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in § 60.2922.
              
              
                § 60.2928
                By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?
                The initial performance test must be conducted within 60 days after your OSWI unit reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after its initial startup.
              
            
            
              Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.2932
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and the operating limits?
                (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for all of the pollutants in table 1 of this subpart for each OSWI unit to determine compliance with the emission limitations. The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in 60.2922.
                (b) You must continuously monitor carbon monoxide emissions to determine compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limitation. Twelve-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance. A 12-hour rolling average value above the carbon monoxide emission limit in table 1 of this subpart constitutes a deviation from the emission limitation.
                (c) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in § 60.2916 or established under § 60.2917. Three-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance with the operating limits unless a different averaging period is established under § 60.2917. A 3-hour rolling average value (unless a different averaging period is established under § 60.2917) above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Operating limits do not apply during performance tests.
              
              
                § 60.2933
                By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?

                § 60.2934
                May I conduct performance testing less often?
                (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test data for at least three consecutive annual tests, and all performance tests for the pollutant over that period show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the 3rd year and no more than 36 months following the previous performance test.
                (b) If your OSWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for that pollutant every 3rd year, but each test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.
                (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission limitation for any pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until three consecutive annual performance tests for that pollutant all show compliance.
              
              
                § 60.2935
                May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish new operating limits?
                Yes, you may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
              
            
            
              Monitoring
              
                § 60.2939
                What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install?

                (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous emission monitoring systems for carbon monoxide and for oxygen. You must monitor the oxygen concentration at each location where you monitor carbon monoxide.
                (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission monitoring system according to the “Monitoring Requirements” in § 60.13.
              
              
                § 60.2940
                How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly?
                (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure carbon monoxide and oxygen.
                (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission monitoring systems within 60 days after your OSWI unit reaches the maximum load level at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after its initial startup.
                (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently (or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your carbon monoxide and oxygen continuous emission monitoring systems. To validate carbon monoxide concentration levels, use EPA Method 10, 10A, or 10B of appendix A of this part. Use EPA Method 3 or 3A to measure oxygen. Collect the data during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications in appendix B of this part. table 3 of this subpart shows the required span values and performance specifications that apply to each continuous emission monitoring system.
                (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy determinations.
              
              
                § 60.2941
                What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission monitoring systems?
                (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems no more than 12 months after the previous evaluation was conducted.
                (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.
              
              
                § 60.2942
                What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems, and is the data collection requirement enforceable?
                (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen. Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen data from your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen.
                (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute period.
                (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the operating hours per day for at least 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal or institutional solid waste.
                (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you have deviated from the data collection requirement regardless of the emission level monitored.
                (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission concentrations.
                (f) If continuous emission monitoring systems are temporarily unavailable to meet the data collection requirements, refer to table 3 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for collecting data when systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum amount of data.
              
              
                
                § 60.2943

              Equations
              
                § 60.2975
                What equations must I use?
                (a) Percent oxygen. Adjust all pollutant concentrations to 7 percent oxygen using equation 1 of this section.
                
                  ER16DE05.000
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen
                  Cmeas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis
                  (20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis)
                  20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent
                  %O2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent
                
                
                (b) Capacity of a very small municipal waste combustion unit. For very small municipal waste combustion units that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the unit capacity based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:
                (1) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
                (i) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).
                (ii) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).

                (2) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum design charging rate.
                
                (c) Capacity of a batch very small municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate the capacity of a batch OSWI unit as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste it can charge per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches it can process in 24 hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
                (d) Carbon monoxide pollutant rate. When hourly average pollutant rates (Eh) are obtained (e.g., CEMS values), compute the rolling average carbon monoxide pollutant rate (Ea) for each 12-hour period using the following equation:
                
                  ER16DE05.001
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Ea = Average carbon monoxide pollutant rate for the 12-hour period, ppm corrected to 7 percent O2.
                  Ehj = Hourly arithmetic average pollutant rate for hour “j,” ppm corrected to 7 percent O2.

              Source:
              70 FR 74907, Dec. 16, 2005, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              Introduction
              
                § 60.2980
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance schedules for the control of emissions from other solid waste incineration (OSWI) units. The pollutants addressed by these emission guidelines are listed in table 2 of this subpart. These emission guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part.
              
              
                
                § 60.2981
                Am I affected by this subpart?
                (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a State or United States protectorate with one or more existing OSWI units or air curtain incinerators subject to this subpart as described in § 60.2994(b) that commenced construction on or before December 9, 2004, you must submit a State plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (b) You must submit the State plan to EPA by December 18, 2006.
              
              
                § 60.2982
                Is a State plan required for all States?
                No, you are not required to submit a State plan if there are no existing OSWI units or air curtain incinerators subject to this subpart as described in § 60.2994(b) in your State and you submit a negative declaration letter in place of the State plan.
              
              
                § 60.2983
                What must I include in my State plan?
                (a) You must include the following nine items in your State plan:
                (1) Inventory of affected incineration units, including those that have ceased operation but have not been dismantled.
                (2) Inventory of emissions from affected incineration units in your State.
                (3) Compliance schedules for each affected incineration unit.
                (4) For each affected incineration unit, emission limitations, operator training and qualification requirements, a waste management plan, and operating parameter requirements that are at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (5) Stack testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
                (6) Transcript of the public hearing on the State plan.
                (7) Provision for State progress reports to EPA.
                (8) Identification of enforceable State mechanisms that you selected for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart.
                (9) Demonstration of your State's legal authority to carry out the sections 111(d) and 129 in your State plan.
                (b) Your State plan may deviate from the format and content of the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. However, if your State plan does deviate, you must demonstrate that your State plan is at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Your State plan must address regulatory applicability, compliance schedule, operator training and qualification, a waste management plan, emission limitations, stack testing, operating parameter requirements, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting, and air curtain incinerator requirements.
                (c) You must follow the requirements of subpart B of this part (Adoption and Submittal of State Plans for Designated Facilities) in your State plan.
              
              
                § 60.2984
                Is there an approval process for my State plan?
                Yes, EPA will review your State plan according to § 60.27.
              
              
                § 60.2985
                What if my State plan is not approvable?
                If you do not submit an approvable State plan (or a negative declaration letter) by December 17, 2007, EPA will develop a Federal plan according to § 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of incineration units not covered by an approved State plan must comply with the Federal plan. The Federal plan is an interim action and applies to units until a State plan covering those units is approved and becomes effective.
              
              
                § 60.2986
                Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?

                No, EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration letters. Once we receive your negative declaration letter, we will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the Federal Register. If, at a later date, an existing incineration unit is found in your State, the Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart would automatically apply to that unit until your State plan is approved.
              
              
                
                § 60.2987
                What compliance schedule must I include in my State plan?
                Your State plan must include compliance schedules that require OSWI units and air curtain incinerators subject to this subpart as described in § 60.2994(b) to achieve final compliance as expeditiously as practicable after approval of the State plan but not later than the earlier of the following two dates:
                (a) December 16, 2010.
                (b) Three years after the effective date of State plan approval.
              
              
                § 60.2988
                Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart that apply instead of the requirements specified in subpart B of this part?
                Yes, subpart B of this part establishes general requirements for developing and processing section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part for the following:
                (a) State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State plans must require all OSWI units and air curtain incinerators subject to this subpart as described in § 60.2994(b) to comply by December 16, 2010 or 3 years after the effective date of State plan approval, whichever is sooner. This applies instead of the option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in § 60.24(f).
                (b) State plans developed to implement this subpart are required to include only one increment of progress for the affected incineration units. This increment is the final compliance date in § 60.21(h)(5). This applies instead of the requirement of § 60.24(e)(1).
              
              
                § 60.2989
                Does this subpart directly affect incineration unit owners and operators in my State?
                (a) No, this subpart does not directly affect incineration unit owners and operators in your State. However, unit owners and operators must comply with the State plan you develop to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (b) If you do not submit an approvable plan to implement and enforce the guidelines contained in this subpart by December 17, 2007, EPA will implement and enforce a Federal plan, as provided in § 60.2985, to ensure that each unit within your State reaches compliance with all the provisions of this subpart by December 16, 2010.
              
              
                § 60.2990
                What Authorities are withheld by EPA?
                The following authorities are withheld by EPA and not transferred to the State, local or tribal agency:
                (1) Approval of alternatives to the emission limitations in table 2 of this subpart and operating limits established under § 60.3023 and table 3 of this subpart.
                (2) Approval of petitions for specific operating limits in § 60.3024.
                (3) Approval of major alternatives to test methods.
                (4) Approval of major alternatives to monitoring.
                (5) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting.
                (6) The status report requirements in § 60.3020(c)(2).
              
            
            
              Applicability of State Plans
              
                § 60.2991
                What incineration units must I address in my State plan?
                Your State plan must address all incineration units in your State that meet all the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
                (a) The incineration unit is an existing incineration unit as defined in § 60.2992.
                (b) The incineration unit is an OSWI unit as defined in § 60.3078 or an air curtain incinerator subject to this subpart as described in § 60.2994(b). OSWI units are very small municipal waste combustion units and institutional waste incineration units as defined in § 60.3078.
                (c) The incineration unit is not excluded under § 60.2993.
              
              
                § 60.2992
                What is an existing incineration unit?

                An existing incineration unit is an OSWI unit or air curtain incinerator subject to this subpart that commenced construction on or before December 9, 2004, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
                
                (a) If the owner or operator of an incineration unit makes changes that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction on or after June 16, 2006, the unit becomes subject to subpart EEEE of this part (New Source Performance Standards for Other Solid Waste Incineration Units) and the State plan no longer applies to that unit.
                (b) If the owner or operator of an existing incineration unit makes physical or operational changes to the unit primarily to comply with the State plan, then subpart EEEE of this part does not apply to that unit. Such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under subpart EEEE of this part.
              
              
                § 60.2993
                Are any combustion units excluded from my State plan?

                The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 180 days after your final compliance date. Your final compliance date is specified in table 1 of this subpart.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.3033
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and the operating limits?

                (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for all of the pollutants in table 2 of this subpart for each OSWI unit to determine compliance with the emission limitations. The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 2 of this subpart and the procedures in § 60.3027.
                (b) You must continuously monitor carbon monoxide emissions to determine compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limitation. Twelve-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance. A 12-hour rolling average value above the carbon monoxide emission limit in table 2 constitutes a deviation from the emission limitation.
                (c) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in § 60.3023 or established under § 60.3024. Three-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance with the operating limits unless a different averaging period is established under § 60.3024. A 3-hour rolling average value (unless a different averaging period is established under § 60.3024) above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Operating limits do not apply during performance tests.
              
              
                § 60.3034
                By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?
                You must conduct annual performance tests within 12 months following the initial performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance tests within 12 months following the previous one.
              
              
                § 60.3035
                May I conduct performance testing less often?
                (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test data for at least three consecutive annual tests, and all performance tests for the pollutant over that period show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the 3rd year and no more than 36 months following the previous performance test.
                (b) If your OSWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for that pollutant every 3rd year, but each test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.
                (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission limitation for any pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until three consecutive annual performance tests for that pollutant all show compliance.
              
              
                § 60.3036
                May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish new operating limits?
                Yes, you may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Monitoring
              
                § 60.3038
                What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install?
                (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous emission monitoring systems for carbon monoxide and for oxygen. You must monitor the oxygen concentration at each location where you monitor carbon monoxide.
                (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission monitoring system according to the “Monitoring Requirements” in § 60.13.
              
              
                § 60.3039
                How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly?
                (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure carbon monoxide and oxygen.
                (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date in table 1 of this subpart.

                (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently (or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your carbon monoxide and oxygen continuous emission monitoring systems. To validate carbon monoxide concentration levels, use EPA Method 10, 10A, or 10B of appendix A of this part. Use EPA Method 3 or 3A to measure oxygen. Collect the data during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications in appendix B of this part. table 4 of this subpart shows the required span values and performance specifications that apply to each continuous emission monitoring system.
                (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy determinations.
              
              
                § 60.3040
                What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission monitoring systems?
                (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems no more than 12 months after the previous evaluation was conducted.
                (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.
              
              
                § 60.3041
                What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems, and is the data collection requirement enforceable?
                (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen. Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen data from your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen.
                (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute period.
                (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the operating hours per day for at least 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal or institutional solid waste.
                (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you have deviated from the data collection requirement regardless of the emission level monitored.
                (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission concentrations.
                (f) If continuous emission monitoring systems are temporarily unavailable to meet the data collection requirements, refer to table 4 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for collecting data when systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum amount of data.
              
              
                § 60.3042
                How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into the appropriate averaging times and units?
                (a) Use Equation 1 in § 60.3076 to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen.
                (b) Use Equation 2 in § 60.3076 to calculate the 12-hour rolling averages for concentrations of carbon monoxide.
              
              
                § 60.3043
                What operating parameter monitoring equipment must I install, and what operating parameters must I monitor?
                (a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under § 60.3022, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in table 3 of this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in table 3 of this subpart at all times.
                (b) You must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate a device or method for measuring the use of any stack that could be used to bypass the control device. The measurement must include the date, time, and duration of the use of the bypass stack.

                (c) If you are using a method or air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under § 60.3022, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established using the procedures in § 60.3024.
              
              
                § 60.3044
                Is there a minimum amount of operating parameter monitoring data I must obtain?
                (a) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments of the monitoring system), you must conduct all monitoring at all times the OSWI unit is operating.
                (b) You must obtain valid monitoring data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours per day for at least 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal or institutional solid waste.
                (c) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you have deviated from the data collection requirement regardless of the operating parameter level monitored.
                (d) Do not use data recorded during monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities for meeting the requirements of this subpart, including data averages and calculations. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance with the operating limits.

                § 60.3060
                When must I submit a title V permit application for my existing unit?
                (a)(1) If your existing unit is not subject to an earlier permit application deadline, a complete title V permit application must be submitted on or before the earlier of the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. (See sections 129(e), 503(c), 503(d), and 502(a) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(i) and 40 CFR 71.5(a)(1)(i).)
                (i) 12 months after the effective date of any applicable EPA-approved Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 State or Tribal plan.
                (ii) 12 months after the effective date of any applicable Federal plan.
                (iii) December 16, 2008.
                (2) For any existing unit not subject to an earlier permit application deadline, the application deadline of 36 months after the promulgation of 40 CFR part 60, subpart FFFF, applies regardless of whether or when any applicable Federal plan is effective, or whether or when any applicable Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 State or Tribal plan is approved by EPA and becomes effective.
                (b) If your existing unit is subject to title V as a result of some triggering requirement(s) other than those specified in paragraph (a) of this section (for example, a unit may be a major source or part of a major source), then your unit may be required to apply for a title V permit prior to the deadlines specified in paragraph (a). If more than one requirement triggers a source's obligation to apply for a title V permit, the 12-month timeframe for filing a title V permit application is triggered by the requirement which first causes the source to be subject to title V. (See section 503(c) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.3(a) and (b), 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(i), 40 CFR 71.3(a) and (b), and 40 CFR 71.5(a)(1)(i).)
                (c) A “complete” title V permit application is one that has been determined or deemed complete by the relevant permitting authority under section 503(d) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.5(a)(2) or 40 CFR 71.5(a)(2). You must submit a complete permit application by the relevant application deadline in order to operate after this date in compliance with Federal law. (See sections 503(d) and 502(a) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.7(b) and 40 CFR 71.7(b).)

              Model Rule—Equations
              
                § 60.3076
                What equations must I use?
                (a) Percent oxygen. Adjust all pollutant concentrations to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section.
                
                  ER16dE05.002
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen
                  Cmeas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis
                  (20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis)
                  20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent
                  %O2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent
                
                
                (b) Capacity of a very small municipal waste combustion unit. For very small municipal waste combustion units that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the unit capacity based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:
                (1) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
                (i) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).
                (ii) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).
                (2) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum design charging rate.
                (c) Capacity of a batch very small municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate the capacity of a batch OSWI unit as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste it can charge per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches it can process in 24 hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the OSWI unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
                (d) Carbon monoxide pollutant rate. When hourly average pollutant rates (Eh) are obtained (e.g., CEMS values), compute the rolling average carbon monoxide pollutant rate (Ea) for each 12-hour period using the following equation:
                
                  ER16DE05.003
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Ea = Average carbon monoxide pollutant rate for the 12-hour period, ppm corrected to 7 percent O2.
                  Ehj = Hourly arithmetic average pollutant rate for hour “j,” ppm corrected to 7 percent O2.

The label must be added according to the labeling requirements specified in 40 CFR 1039.135(b). Engine manufacturers must specify in the owner's manual that operation of emergency engines is limited to emergency operations and required maintenance and testing.
                (g) Manufacturers of fire pump engines may use the test cycle in table 6 to this subpart for testing fire pump engines and may test at the NFPA certified nameplate HP, provided that the engine is labeled as “Fire Pump Applications Only”.
                (h) Engine manufacturers, including importers, may introduce into commerce uncertified engines or engines certified to earlier standards that were manufactured before the new or changed standards took effect until inventories are depleted, as long as such engines are part of normal inventory. For example, if the engine manufacturers' normal industry practice is to keep on hand a one-month supply of engines based on its projected sales, and a new tier of standards starts to apply for the 2009 model year, the engine manufacturer may manufacture engines based on the normal inventory requirements late in the 2008 model year, and sell those engines for installation. The engine manufacturer may not circumvent the provisions of § 60.4201 or § 60.4202 by stockpiling engines that are built before new or changed standards take effect. Stockpiling of such engines beyond normal industry practice is a violation of this subpart.
                (i) The replacement engine provisions of 40 CFR 89.1003(b)(7), 40 CFR 94.1103(b)(3), 40 CFR 94.1103(b)(4) and 40 CFR 1068.240 are applicable to stationary CI engines replacing existing equipment that is less than 15 years old.

                (j) Stationary CI ICE manufacturers may equip their stationary CI internal combustion engines certified to the emission standards in 40 CFR part 1039 with AECDs for qualified emergency situations according to the requirements of 40 CFR 1039.665. Manufacturers of stationary CI ICE equipped with AECDs as allowed by 40 CFR 1039.665 must meet all of the requirements in 40 CFR 1039.665 that apply to manufacturers. Manufacturers must document that the engine complies with the Tier 1 standard in 40 CFR 89.112 when the AECD is activated. Manufacturers must provide any relevant testing, engineering analysis, or other information in sufficient detail to support such statement when applying for certification (including amending an existing certificate) of an engine equipped with an AECD as allowed by 40 CFR 1039.665.

The label must be added according to the labeling requirements specified in 40 CFR 1048.135(b).
                (e) All stationary SI engines subject to mandatory certification that do not meet the requirements of this subpart must be labeled according to 40 CFR 1068.230 and must be exported under the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.230. Stationary SI engines subject to standards in 40 CFR part 90 may use the provisions in 40 CFR 90.909. Manufacturers of stationary engines with a maximum engine power greater than 25 HP that are not certified to standards and other requirements under 40 CFR part 1048 are subject to the labeling provisions of 40 CFR 1048.20 pertaining to excluded stationary engines.
                (f) For manufacturers of gaseous-fueled stationary engines required to meet the warranty provisions in 40 CFR 90.1103 or 1054.120, we may establish an hour-based warranty period equal to at least the certified emissions life of the engines (in engine operating hours) if we determine that these engines are likely to operate for a number of hours greater than the applicable useful life within 24 months. We will not approve an alternate warranty under this paragraph (f) for nonroad engines. An alternate warranty period approved under this paragraph (f) will be the specified number of engine operating hours or two years, whichever comes first. The engine manufacturer shall request this alternate warranty period in its application for certification or in an earlier submission. We may approve an alternate warranty period for an engine family subject to the following conditions:

                (1) The engines must be equipped with non-resettable hour meters.
                
                (2) The engines must be designed to operate for a number of hours substantially greater than the applicable certified emissions life.
                (3) The emission-related warranty for the engines may not be shorter than any published warranty offered by the manufacturer without charge for the engines. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component shall not be shorter than any published warranty offered by the manufacturer without charge for that component.

                (iii) Emergency stationary ICE may be operated for periods where there is a deviation of voltage or frequency of 5 percent or greater below standard voltage or frequency.
                
                (3) Emergency stationary ICE may be operated for up to 50 hours per calendar year in non-emergency situations. The 50 hours of operation in non-emergency situations are counted as part of the 100 hours per calendar year for maintenance and testing and emergency demand response provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations cannot be used for peak shaving or non-emergency demand response, or to generate income for a facility to an electric grid or otherwise supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity.
                (i) The 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations can be used to supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity if all of the following conditions are met:
                (A) The engine is dispatched by the local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator;
                (B) The dispatch is intended to mitigate local transmission and/or distribution limitations so as to avert potential voltage collapse or line overloads that could lead to the interruption of power supply in a local area or region.
                (C) The dispatch follows reliability, emergency operation or similar protocols that follow specific NERC, regional, state, public utility commission or local standards or guidelines.
                (D) The power is provided only to the facility itself or to support the local transmission and distribution system.
                (E) The owner or operator identifies and records the entity that dispatches the engine and the specific NERC, regional, state, public utility commission or local standards or guidelines that are being followed for dispatching the engine. The local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator may keep these records on behalf of the engine owner or operator.
                (ii) [Reserved]
                (e) Owners and operators of stationary SI natural gas fired engines may operate their engines using propane for a maximum of 100 hours per year as an alternative fuel solely during emergency operations, but must keep records of such use. If propane is used for more than 100 hours per year in an engine that is not certified to the emission standards when using propane, the owners and operators are required to conduct a performance test to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of § 60.4233.
                (f) If you are an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal combustion engine that is less than or equal to 500 HP and you purchase a non-certified engine or you do not operate and maintain your certified stationary SI internal combustion engine and control device according to the manufacturer's written emission-related instructions, you are required to perform initial performance testing as indicated in this section, but you are not required to conduct subsequent performance testing unless the stationary engine is rebuilt or undergoes major repair or maintenance. A rebuilt stationary SI ICE means an engine that has been rebuilt as that term is defined in 40 CFR 94.11(a).
                (g) It is expected that air-to-fuel ratio controllers will be used with the operation of three-way catalysts/non-selective catalytic reduction. The AFR controller must be maintained and operated appropriately in order to ensure proper operation of the engine and control device to minimize emissions at all times.
                (h) If you are an owner/operator of an stationary SI internal combustion engine with maximum engine power greater than or equal to 500 HP that is manufactured after July 1, 2007 and before July 1, 2008, and must comply with the emission standards specified in sections 60.4233(b) or (c), you must comply by one of the methods specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(4) of this section.
                (1) Purchasing an engine certified according to 40 CFR part 1048. The engine must be installed and configured according to the manufacturer's specifications.

                (2) Keeping records of performance test results for each pollutant for a test conducted on a similar engine. The test must have been conducted using the same methods specified in this subpart and these methods must have been followed correctly.
                
                (3) Keeping records of engine manufacturer data indicating compliance with the standards.
                (4) Keeping records of control device vendor data indicating compliance with the standards.
                (i) If you are an owner or operator of a modified or reconstructed stationary SI internal combustion engine and must comply with the emission standards specified in § 60.4233(f), you must demonstrate compliance according to one of the methods specified in paragraphs (i)(1) or (2) of this section.
                (1) Purchasing, or otherwise owning or operating, an engine certified to the emission standards in § 60.4233(f), as applicable.
                (2) Conducting a performance test to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission standards according to the requirements specified in § 60.4244. The test must be conducted within 60 days after the engine commences operation after the modification or reconstruction.

                § 60.4244
                What test methods and other procedures must I use if I am an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal combustion engine?
                Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE who conduct performance tests must follow the procedures in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
                (a) Each performance test must be conducted within 10 percent of 100 percent peak (or the highest achievable) load and according to the requirements in § 60.8 and under the specific conditions that are specified by Table 2 to this subpart.
                (b) You may not conduct performance tests during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, as specified in § 60.8(c). If your stationary SI internal combustion engine is non-operational, you do not need to startup the engine solely to conduct a performance test; however, you must conduct the performance test immediately upon startup of the engine.
                (c) You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in § 60.8(f). Each test run must be conducted within 10 percent of 100 percent peak (or the highest achievable) load and last at least 1 hour.
                (d) To determine compliance with the NOX mass per unit output emission limitation, convert the concentration of NOX in the engine exhaust using Equation 1 of this section:

                  HP-hr = Brake work of the engine, in HP-hr.
                
                
                (f) For purposes of this subpart, when calculating emissions of VOC, emissions of formaldehyde should not be included. To determine compliance with the VOC mass per unit output emission limitation, convert the concentration of VOC in the engine exhaust using Equation 3 of this section:
                
                  ER18JA08.002

                (g) If the owner/operator chooses to measure VOC emissions using either Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, then it has the option of correcting the measured VOC emissions to account for the potential differences in measured values between these methods and Method 25A. The results from Method 18 and Method 320 can be corrected for response factor differences using Equations 4 and 5 of this section. The corrected VOC concentration can then be placed on a propane basis using Equation 6 of this section.

                § 60.4248
                What definitions apply to this subpart?
                As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the CAA and in subpart A of this part.
                
                  Certified emissions life means the period during which the engine is designed to properly function in terms of reliability and fuel consumption, without being remanufactured, specified as a number of hours of operation or calendar years, whichever comes first. The values for certified emissions life for stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power less than or equal to 19 KW (25 HP) are given in 40 CFR 90.105, 40 CFR 1054.107, and 40 CFR 1060.101, as appropriate. The values for certified emissions life for stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) certified to 40 CFR part 1048 are given in 40 CFR 1048.101(g). The certified emissions life for stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 75 KW (100 HP) certified under the voluntary manufacturer certification program of this subpart is 5,000 hours or 7 years, whichever comes first. You may request in your application for certification that we approve a shorter certified emissions life for an engine family. We may approve a shorter certified emissions life, in hours of engine operation but not in years, if we determine that these engines will rarely operate longer than the shorter certified emissions life. If engines identical to those in the engine family have already been produced and are in use, your demonstration must include documentation from such in-use engines. In other cases, your demonstration must include an engineering analysis of information equivalent to such in-use data, such as data from research engines or similar engine models that are already in production. Your demonstration must also include any overhaul interval that you recommend, any mechanical warranty that you offer for the engine or its components, and any relevant customer design specifications. Your demonstration may include any other relevant information. The certified emissions life value may not be shorter than any of the following:
                (i) 1,000 hours of operation.
                (ii) Your recommended overhaul interval.
                (iii) Your mechanical warranty for the engine.
                
                  Certified stationary internal combustion engine means an engine that belongs to an engine family that has a certificate of conformity that complies with the emission standards and requirements in this part, or of 40 CFR part 90, 40 CFR part 1048, or 40 CFR part 1054, as appropriate.
                
                  Combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not limited to the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas systems, control systems (except emissions control equipment), and any ancillary components and sub-components comprising any simple cycle combustion turbine, any regenerative/recuperative cycle combustion turbine, the combustion turbine portion of any cogeneration cycle combustion system, or the combustion turbine portion of any combined cycle steam/electric generating system.
                
                  Compression ignition means relating to a type of stationary internal combustion engine that is not a spark ignition engine.
                
                  Date of manufacture means one of the following things:
                (1) For freshly manufactured engines and modified engines, date of manufacture means the date the engine is originally produced.
                (2) For reconstructed engines, date of manufacture means the date the engine was originally produced, except as specified in paragraph (3) of this definition.
                (3) Reconstructed engines are assigned a new date of manufacture if the fixed capital cost of the new and refurbished components exceeds 75 percent of the fixed capital cost of a comparable entirely new facility. An engine that is produced from a previously used engine block does not retain the date of manufacture of the engine in which the engine block was previously used if the engine is produced using all new components except for the engine block. In these cases, the date of manufacture is the date of reconstruction or the date the new engine is produced.
                
                  Diesel fuel means any liquid obtained from the distillation of petroleum with a boiling point of approximately 150 to 360 degrees Celsius. One commonly used form is number 2 distillate oil.
                
                  Digester gas means any gaseous by-product of wastewater treatment typically formed through the anaerobic decomposition of organic waste materials and composed principally of methane and carbon dioxide (CO2).
                
                  Emergency stationary internal combustion engine means any stationary reciprocating internal combustion engine that meets all of the criteria in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition. All emergency stationary ICE must comply with the requirements specified in § 60.4243(d) in order to be considered emergency stationary ICE. If the engine does not comply with the requirements specified in § 60.4243(d), then it is not considered to be an emergency stationary ICE under this subpart.

                (1) The stationary ICE is operated to provide electrical power or mechanical work during an emergency situation. Examples include stationary ICE used to produce power for critical networks or equipment (including power supplied to portions of a facility) when electric power from the local utility (or the normal power source, if the facility runs on its own power production) is interrupted, or stationary ICE used to pump water in the case of fire or flood, etc.

                  Manufacturer has the meaning given in section 216(1) of the Clean Air Act. In general, this term includes any person who manufactures a stationary engine for sale in the United States or otherwise introduces a new stationary engine into commerce in the United States. This includes importers who import stationary engines for resale.
                
                  Maximum engine power means maximum engine power as defined in 40 CFR 1048.801.
                
                  Model year means the calendar year in which an engine is manufactured (see “date of manufacture”), except as follows:
                (1) Model year means the annual new model production period of the engine manufacturer in which an engine is manufactured (see “date of manufacture”), if the annual new model production period is different than the calendar year and includes January 1 of the calendar year for which the model year is named. It may not begin before January 2 of the previous calendar year and it must end by December 31 of the named calendar year.
                (2) For an engine that is converted to a stationary engine after being placed into service as a nonroad or other non-stationary engine, model year means the calendar year or new model production period in which the engine was manufactured (see “date of manufacture”).
                
                  Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the Earth's surface, of which the principal constituent is methane. Natural gas may be field or pipeline quality.
                
                  Other internal combustion engine means any internal combustion engine, except combustion turbines, which is not a reciprocating internal combustion engine or rotary internal combustion engine.
                
                  Pipeline-quality natural gas means a naturally occurring fluid mixture of hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, or propane) produced in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface that maintains a gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure under ordinary conditions, and which is provided by a supplier through a pipeline. Pipeline-quality natural gas must either be composed of at least 70 percent methane by volume or have a gross calorific value between 950 and 1,100 British thermal units per standard cubic foot.
                
                  Rich burn engine means any four-stroke spark ignited engine where the manufacturer's recommended operating air/fuel ratio divided by the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio at full load conditions is less than or equal to 1.1. Engines originally manufactured as rich burn engines, but modified prior to June 12, 2006, with passive emission control technology for NOX (such as pre-combustion chambers) will be considered lean burn engines. Also, existing engines where there are no manufacturer's recommendations regarding air/fuel ratio will be considered a rich burn engine if the excess oxygen content of the exhaust at full load conditions is less than or equal to 2 percent.
                
                  Rotary internal combustion engine means any internal combustion engine which uses rotary motion to convert heat energy into mechanical work.
                
                  Spark ignition means relating to either: a gasoline-fueled engine; or any other type of engine with a spark plug (or other sparking device) and with operating characteristics significantly similar to the theoretical Otto combustion cycle. Spark ignition engines usually use a throttle to regulate intake air flow to control power during normal operation. Dual-fuel engines in which a liquid fuel (typically diesel fuel) is used for compression ignition and gaseous fuel (typically natural gas) is used as the primary fuel at an annual average ratio of less than 2 parts diesel fuel to 100 parts total fuel on an energy equivalent basis are spark ignition engines.
                
                  Stationary internal combustion engine means any internal combustion engine, except combustion turbines, that converts heat energy into mechanical work and is not mobile. Stationary ICE differ from mobile ICE in that a stationary internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30 (excluding paragraph (2)(ii) of that definition), and is not used to propel a motor vehicle, aircraft, or a vehicle used solely for competition. Stationary ICE include reciprocating ICE, rotary ICE, and other ICE, except combustion turbines.
                
                  Stationary internal combustion engine test cell/stand means an engine test cell/stand, as defined in 40 CFR part 63, subpart PPPPP, that tests stationary ICE.

                  Subpart means 40 CFR part 60, subpart JJJJ.
                
                  Two-stroke engine means a type of engine which completes the power cycle in single crankshaft revolution by combining the intake and compression operations into one stroke and the power and exhaust operations into a second stroke. This system requires auxiliary scavenging and inherently runs lean of stoichiometric.
                
                  Volatile organic compounds means volatile organic compounds as defined in 40 CFR 51.100(s).
                
                  Voluntary certification program means an optional engine certification program that manufacturers of stationary SI internal combustion engines with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) that do not use gasoline and are not rich burn engines that use LPG can choose to participate in to certify their engines to the emission standards in § 60.4231(d) or (e), as applicable.

              Introduction
              
                § 60.4300
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes emission standards and compliance schedules for the control of emissions from stationary combustion turbines that commenced construction, modification or reconstruction after February 18, 2005.
              
            
            
              
              Applicability
              
                § 60.4305
                Does this subpart apply to my stationary combustion turbine?
                (a) If you are the owner or operator of a stationary combustion turbine with a heat input at peak load equal to or greater than 10.7 gigajoules (10 MMBtu) per hour, based on the higher heating value of the fuel, which commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after February 18, 2005, your turbine is subject to this subpart. Only heat input to the combustion turbine should be included when determining whether or not this subpart is applicable to your turbine. Any additional heat input to associated heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) or duct burners should not be included when determining your peak heat input. However, this subpart does apply to emissions from any associated HRSG and duct burners.
                (b) Stationary combustion turbines regulated under this subpart are exempt from the requirements of subpart GG of this part. Heat recovery steam generators and duct burners regulated under this subpart are exempted from the requirements of subparts Da, Db, and Dc of this part.
              
              
                § 60.4310
                What types of operations are exempt from these standards of performance?

                (a) Emergency combustion turbines, as defined in § 60.4420(i), are exempt from the nitrogen oxides (NOX) emission limits in § 60.4320.

                (b) Stationary combustion turbines engaged by manufacturers in research and development of equipment for both combustion turbine emission control techniques and combustion turbine efficiency improvements are exempt from the NOX emission limits in § 60.4320 on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Administrator.
                (c) Stationary combustion turbines at integrated gasification combined cycle electric utility steam generating units that are subject to subpart Da of this part are exempt from this subpart.
                (d) Combustion turbine test cells/stands are exempt from this subpart.
              
            
            
              Emission Limits
              
                § 60.4315
                What pollutants are regulated by this subpart?

                The pollutants regulated by this subpart are nitrogen oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).
              
              
                § 60.4320

                What emission limits must I meet for nitrogen oxides (NOX)?
                (a) You must meet the emission limits for NOX specified in Table 1 to this subpart.

                (b) If you have two or more turbines that are connected to a single generator, each turbine must meet the emission limits for NOX.
              
              
                § 60.4325
                What emission limits must I meet for NOX if my turbine burns both natural gas and distillate oil (or some other combination of fuels)?
                You must meet the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart. If your total heat input is greater than or equal to 50 percent natural gas, you must meet the corresponding limit for a natural gas-fired turbine when you are burning that fuel. Similarly, when your total heat input is greater than 50 percent distillate oil and fuels other than natural gas, you must meet the corresponding limit for distillate oil and fuels other than natural gas for the duration of the time that you burn that particular fuel.
              
              
                § 60.4330
                What emission limits must I meet for sulfur dioxide (SO2)?
                (a) If your turbine is located in a continental area, you must comply with either paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section. If your turbine is located in Alaska, you do not have to comply with the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section until January 1, 2008.

                (1) You must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the subject stationary combustion turbine any gases which contain SO2 in excess of 110 nanograms per Joule (ng/J) (0.90 pounds per megawatt-hour (lb/MWh)) gross output;

                (2) You must not burn in the subject stationary combustion turbine any fuel which contains total potential sulfur emissions in excess of 26 ng SO2/J (0.060 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input. If your turbine simultaneously fires multiple fuels, each fuel must meet this requirement; or

                (3) For each stationary combustion turbine burning at least 50 percent biogas on a calendar month basis, as determined based on total heat input, you must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the affected source any gases that contain SO2 in excess of 65 ng SO2/J (0.15 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input.
                (b) If your turbine is located in a noncontinental area or a continental area that the Administrator determines does not have access to natural gas and that the removal of sulfur compounds would cause more environmental harm than benefit, you must comply with one or the other of the following conditions:

                (1) You must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the subject stationary combustion turbine any gases which contain SO2 in excess of 780 ng/J (6.2 lb/MWh) gross output, or

                (2) You must not burn in the subject stationary combustion turbine any fuel which contains total sulfur with potential sulfur emissions in excess of 180 ng SO2/J (0.42 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input. If your turbine simultaneously fires multiple fuels, each fuel must meet this requirement.

              General Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.4333
                What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
                (a) You must operate and maintain your stationary combustion turbine, air pollution control equipment, and monitoring equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions at all times including during startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
                (b) When an affected unit with heat recovery utilizes a common steam header with one or more combustion turbines, the owner or operator shall either:
                (1) Determine compliance with the applicable NOX emissions limits by measuring the emissions combined with the emissions from the other unit(s) utilizing the common heat recovery unit; or
                (2) Develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on methods for apportioning the combined gross energy output from the heat recovery unit for each of the affected combustion turbines. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning the combined gross energy output measured at the steam turbine whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation of emissions related under this part.
              
            
            
              Monitoring
              
                § 60.4335
                How do I demonstrate compliance for NOX if I use water or steam injection?

                (a) If you are using water or steam injection to control NOX emissions, you must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous monitoring system to monitor and record the fuel consumption and the ratio of water or steam to fuel being fired in the turbine when burning a fuel that requires water or steam injection for compliance.
                (b) Alternatively, you may use continuous emission monitoring, as follows:

                (1) Install, certify, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) consisting of a NOX monitor and a diluent gas (oxygen (O2) or carbon dioxide (CO2)) monitor, to determine the hourly NOX emission rate in parts per million (ppm) or pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu); and
                (2) For units complying with the output-based standard, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a fuel flow meter (or flow meters) to continuously measure the heat input to the affected unit; and
                (3) For units complying with the output-based standard, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a watt meter (or meters) to continuously measure the gross electrical output of the unit in megawatt-hours; and

                (4) For combined heat and power units complying with the output-based standard, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters for useful recovered energy flow rate, temperature, and pressure, to continuously measure the total thermal energy output in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).
              
              
                § 60.4340

                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance for NOX if I do not use water or steam injection?

                (a) If you are not using water or steam injection to control NOX emissions, you must perform annual performance tests in accordance with § 60.4400 to demonstrate continuous compliance. If the NOX emission result from the performance test is less than or equal to 75 percent of the NOX emission limit for the turbine, you may reduce the frequency of subsequent performance tests to once every 2 years (no more than 26 calendar months following the previous performance test). If the results of any subsequent performance test exceed 75 percent of the NOX emission limit for the turbine, you must resume annual performance tests.
                (b) As an alternative, you may install, calibrate, maintain and operate one of the following continuous monitoring systems:
                (1) Continuous emission monitoring as described in §§ 60.4335(b) and 60.4345, or
                (2) Continuous parameter monitoring as follows:

                (i) For a diffusion flame turbine without add-on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) controls, you must define parameters indicative of the unit's NOX formation characteristics, and you must monitor these parameters continuously.

                (ii) For any lean premix stationary combustion turbine, you must continuously monitor the appropriate parameters to determine whether the unit is operating in low-NOX mode.
                (iii) For any turbine that uses SCR to reduce NOX emissions, you must continuously monitor appropriate parameters to verify the proper operation of the emission controls.

                (iv) For affected units that are also regulated under part 75 of this chapter, with state approval you can monitor the NOX emission rate using the methodology in appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, or the low mass emissions methodology in § 75.19, the requirements of this paragraph (b) may be met by performing the parametric monitoring described in section 2.3 of part 75 appendix E or in § 75.19(c)(1)(iv)(H).
              
              
                § 60.4345
                What are the requirements for the continuous emission monitoring system equipment, if I choose to use this option?
                If the option to use a NOX CEMS is chosen:
                (a) Each NOX diluent CEMS must be installed and certified according to Performance Specification 2 (PS 2) in appendix B to this part, except the 7-day calibration drift is based on unit operating days, not calendar days. With state approval, Procedure 1 in appendix F to this part is not required. Alternatively, a NOX diluent CEMS that is installed and certified according to appendix A of part 75 of this chapter is acceptable for use under this subpart. The relative accuracy test audit (RATA) of the CEMS shall be performed on a lb/MMBtu basis.

                (b) As specified in § 60.13(e)(2), during each full unit operating hour, both the NOX monitor and the diluent monitor must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute quadrant of the hour, to validate the hour. For partial unit operating hours, at least one valid data point must be obtained with each monitor for each quadrant of the hour in which the unit operates. For unit operating hours in which required quality assurance and maintenance activities are performed on the CEMS, a minimum of two valid data points (one in each of two quadrants) are required for each monitor to validate the NOX emission rate for the hour.
                (c) Each fuel flowmeter shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, with state approval, fuel flowmeters that meet the installation, certification, and quality assurance requirements of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter are acceptable for use under this subpart.

                (d) Each watt meter, steam flow meter, and each pressure or temperature measurement device shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's instructions.
                
                (e) The owner or operator shall develop and keep on-site a quality assurance (QA) plan for all of the continuous monitoring equipment described in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section. For the CEMS and fuel flow meters, the owner or operator may, with state approval, satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by implementing the QA program and plan described in section 1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.
              
              
                § 60.4350
                How do I use data from the continuous emission monitoring equipment to identify excess emissions?
                For purposes of identifying excess emissions:
                (a) All CEMS data must be reduced to hourly averages as specified in § 60.13(h).

                (b) For each unit operating hour in which a valid hourly average, as described in § 60.4345(b), is obtained for both NOX and diluent monitors, the data acquisition and handling system must calculate and record the hourly NOX emission rate in units of ppm or lb/MMBtu, using the appropriate equation from method 19 in appendix A of this part. For any hour in which the hourly average O2 concentration exceeds 19.0 percent O2 (or the hourly average CO2 concentration is less than 1.0 percent CO2), a diluent cap value of 19.0 percent O2 or 1.0 percent CO2 (as applicable) may be used in the emission calculations.
                (c) Correction of measured NOX concentrations to 15 percent O2 is not allowed.
                (d) If you have installed and certified a NOX diluent CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, states can approve that only quality assured data from the CEMS shall be used to identify excess emissions under this subpart. Periods where the missing data substitution procedures in subpart D of part 75 are applied are to be reported as monitor downtime in the excess emissions and monitoring performance report required under § 60.7(c).
                (e) All required fuel flow rate, steam flow rate, temperature, pressure, and megawatt data must be reduced to hourly averages.
                (f) Calculate the hourly average NOX emission rates, in units of the emission standards under § 60.4320, using either ppm for units complying with the concentration limit or the following equation for units complying with the output based standard:
                (1) For simple-cycle operation:

                (2) For combined-cycle and combined heat and power complying with the output-based standard, use Equation 1 of this subpart, except that the gross energy output is calculated as the sum of the total electrical and mechanical energy generated by the combustion turbine, the additional electrical or mechanical energy (if any) generated by the steam turbine following the heat recovery steam generator, and 100 percent of the total useful thermal energy output that is not used to generate additional electricity or mechanical output, expressed in equivalent MW, as in the following equations:
                
                  ER06JY06.001

                  ER06JY06.002
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Ps = useful thermal energy of the steam, measured relative to ISO conditions, not used to generate additional electric or mechanical output, in MW,
                  Q = measured steam flow rate in lb/h,

                  H = enthalpy of the steam at measured temperature and pressure relative to ISO conditions, in Btu/lb, and 3.413 × 106 = conversion from Btu/h to MW.
                  
                  Po = other useful heat recovery, measured relative to ISO conditions, not used for steam generation or performance enhancement of the combustion turbine.
                
                
                (3) For mechanical drive applications complying with the output-based standard, use the following equation:
                
                  ER06JY06.003

                  BL = manufacturer's base load rating of turbine, in MW, and
                  AL = actual load as a percentage of the base load.
                
                
                (g) For simple cycle units without heat recovery, use the calculated hourly average emission rates from paragraph (f) of this section to assess excess emissions on a 4-hour rolling average basis, as described in § 60.4380(b)(1).
                (h) For combined cycle and combined heat and power units with heat recovery, use the calculated hourly average emission rates from paragraph (f) of this section to assess excess emissions on a 30 unit operating day rolling average basis, as described in § 60.4380(b)(1).
              
              
                § 60.4355
                How do I establish and document a proper parameter monitoring plan?

                (a) The steam or water to fuel ratio or other parameters that are continuously monitored as described in §§ 60.4335 and 60.4340 must be monitored during the performance test required under § 60.8, to establish acceptable values and ranges. You may supplement the performance test data with engineering analyses, design specifications, manufacturer's recommendations and other relevant information to define the acceptable parametric ranges more precisely. You must develop and keep on-site a parameter monitoring plan which explains the procedures used to document proper operation of the NOX emission controls. The plan must:

                (1) Include the indicators to be monitored and show there is a significant relationship to emissions and proper operation of the NOX emission controls,
                (2) Pick ranges (or designated conditions) of the indicators, or describe the process by which such range (or designated condition) will be established,
                (3) Explain the process you will use to make certain that you obtain data that are representative of the emissions or parameters being monitored (such as detector location, installation specification if applicable),
                (4) Describe quality assurance and control practices that are adequate to ensure the continuing validity of the data,
                (5) Describe the frequency of monitoring and the data collection procedures which you will use (e.g., you are using a computerized data acquisition over a number of discrete data points with the average (or maximum value) being used for purposes of determining whether an exceedance has occurred), and
                (6) Submit justification for the proposed elements of the monitoring. If a proposed performance specification differs from manufacturer recommendation, you must explain the reasons for the differences. You must submit the data supporting the justification, but you may refer to generally available sources of information used to support the justification. You may rely on engineering assessments and other data, provided you demonstrate factors which assure compliance or explain why performance testing is unnecessary to establish indicator ranges. When establishing indicator ranges, you may choose to simplify the process by treating the parameters as if they were correlated. Using this assumption, testing can be divided into two cases:

                (i) All indicators are significant only on one end of range (e.g., for a thermal incinerator controlling volatile organic compounds (VOC) it is only important to insure a minimum temperature, not a maximum). In this case, you may conduct your study so that each parameter is at the significant limit of its range while you conduct your emissions testing. If the emissions tests show that the source is in compliance at the significant limit of each parameter, then as long as each parameter is within its limit, you are presumed to be in compliance.
                
                (ii) Some or all indicators are significant on both ends of the range. In this case, you may conduct your study so that each parameter that is significant at both ends of its range assumes its extreme values in all possible combinations of the extreme values (either single or double) of all of the other parameters. For example, if there were only two parameters, A and B, and A had a range of values while B had only a minimum value, the combinations would be A high with B minimum and A low with B minimum. If both A and B had a range, the combinations would be A high and B high, A low and B low, A high and B low, A low and B high. For the case of four parameters all having a range, there are 16 possible combinations.

                (b) For affected units that are also subject to part 75 of this chapter and that have state approval to use the low mass emissions methodology in § 75.19 or the NOX emission measurement methodology in appendix E to part 75, you may meet the requirements of this paragraph by developing and keeping on-site (or at a central location for unmanned facilities) a QA plan, as described in § 75.19(e)(5) or in section 2.3 of appendix E to part 75 of this chapter and section 1.3.6 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.
              
              
                § 60.4360
                How do I determine the total sulfur content of the turbine's combustion fuel?
                You must monitor the total sulfur content of the fuel being fired in the turbine, except as provided in § 60.4365. The sulfur content of the fuel must be determined using total sulfur methods described in § 60.4415. Alternatively, if the total sulfur content of the gaseous fuel during the most recent performance test was less than half the applicable limit, ASTM D4084, D4810, D5504, or D6228, or Gas Processors Association Standard 2377 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), which measure the major sulfur compounds, may be used.
              
              
                § 60.4365
                How can I be exempted from monitoring the total sulfur content of the fuel?

                You may elect not to monitor the total sulfur content of the fuel combusted in the turbine, if the fuel is demonstrated not to exceed potential sulfur emissions of 26 ng SO2/J (0.060 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input for units located in continental areas and 180 ng SO2/J (0.42 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input for units located in noncontinental areas or a continental area that the Administrator determines does not have access to natural gas and that the removal of sulfur compounds would cause more environmental harm than benefit. You must use one of the following sources of information to make the required demonstration:

                (a) The fuel quality characteristics in a current, valid purchase contract, tariff sheet or transportation contract for the fuel, specifying that the maximum total sulfur content for oil use in continental areas is 0.05 weight percent (500 ppmw) or less and 0.4 weight percent (4,000 ppmw) or less for noncontinental areas, the total sulfur content for natural gas use in continental areas is 20 grains of sulfur or less per 100 standard cubic feet and 140 grains of sulfur or less per 100 standard cubic feet for noncontinental areas, has potential sulfur emissions of less than less than 26 ng SO2/J (0.060 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input for continental areas and has potential sulfur emissions of less than less than 180 ng SO2/J (0.42 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input for noncontinental areas; or

                (b) Representative fuel sampling data which show that the sulfur content of the fuel does not exceed 26 ng SO2/J (0.060 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input for continental areas or 180 ng SO2/J (0.42 lb SO2/MMBtu) heat input for noncontinental areas. At a minimum, the amount of fuel sampling data specified in section 2.3.1.4 or 2.3.2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter is required.
              
              
                § 60.4370
                How often must I determine the sulfur content of the fuel?
                The frequency of determining the sulfur content of the fuel must be as follows:
                (a) Fuel oil. For fuel oil, use one of the total sulfur sampling options and the associated sampling frequency described in sections 2.2.3, 2.2.4.1, 2.2.4.2, and 2.2.4.3 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter (i.e., flow proportional sampling, daily sampling, sampling from the unit's storage tank after each addition of fuel to the tank, or sampling each delivery prior to combining it with fuel oil already in the intended storage tank).
                (b) Gaseous fuel. If you elect not to demonstrate sulfur content using options in § 60.4365, and the fuel is supplied without intermediate bulk storage, the sulfur content value of the gaseous fuel must be determined and recorded once per unit operating day.
                (c) Custom schedules. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, operators or fuel vendors may develop custom schedules for determination of the total sulfur content of gaseous fuels, based on the design and operation of the affected facility and the characteristics of the fuel supply. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, custom schedules shall be substantiated with data and shall be approved by the Administrator before they can be used to comply with the standard in § 60.4330.
                (1) The two custom sulfur monitoring schedules set forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) and in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are acceptable, without prior Administrative approval:
                (i) The owner or operator shall obtain daily total sulfur content measurements for 30 consecutive unit operating days, using the applicable methods specified in this subpart. Based on the results of the 30 daily samples, the required frequency for subsequent monitoring of the fuel's total sulfur content shall be as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, as applicable.
                (ii) If none of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total sulfur content exceeds half the applicable standard, subsequent sulfur content monitoring may be performed at 12-month intervals. If any of the samples taken at 12-month intervals has a total sulfur content greater than half but less than the applicable limit, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section. If any measurement exceeds the applicable limit, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
                (iii) If at least one of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total sulfur content is greater than half but less than the applicable limit, but none exceeds the applicable limit, then:
                (A) Collect and analyze a sample every 30 days for 3 months. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds the applicable limit, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Otherwise, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.
                (B) Begin monitoring at 6-month intervals for 12 months. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds the applicable limit, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Otherwise, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.
                (C) Begin monitoring at 12-month intervals. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds the applicable limit, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Otherwise, continue to monitor at this frequency.
                (iv) If a sulfur content measurement exceeds the applicable limit, immediately begin daily monitoring according to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Daily monitoring shall continue until 30 consecutive daily samples, each having a sulfur content no greater than the applicable limit, are obtained. At that point, the applicable procedures of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section shall be followed.
                (2) The owner or operator may use the data collected from the 720-hour sulfur sampling demonstration described in section 2.3.6 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter to determine a custom sulfur sampling schedule, as follows:
                (i) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from the 720 hourly samples does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf, no additional monitoring of the sulfur content of the gas is required, for the purposes of this subpart.
                (ii) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from any of the 720 hourly samples exceeds 20 grains/100 scf, but none of the sulfur content values (when converted to weight percent sulfur) exceeds half the applicable limit, then the minimum required sampling frequency shall be one sample at 12 month intervals.

                (iii) If any sample result exceeds half the applicable limit, but none exceeds the applicable limit, follow the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
                
                (iv) If the sulfur content of any of the 720 hourly samples exceeds the applicable limit, follow the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
              
            
            
              Reporting
              
                § 60.4375
                What reports must I submit?
                (a) For each affected unit required to continuously monitor parameters or emissions, or to periodically determine the fuel sulfur content under this subpart, you must submit reports of excess emissions and monitor downtime, in accordance with § 60.7(c). Excess emissions must be reported for all periods of unit operation, including start-up, shutdown, and malfunction.
                (b) For each affected unit that performs annual performance tests in accordance with § 60.4340(a), you must submit a written report of the results of each performance test before the close of business on the 60th day following the completion of the performance test.
              
              
                § 60.4380

                How are excess emissions and monitor downtime defined for NOX?
                For the purpose of reports required under § 60.7(c), periods of excess emissions and monitor downtime that must be reported are defined as follows:
                (a) For turbines using water or steam to fuel ratio monitoring:

                (1) An excess emission is any unit operating hour for which the 4-hour rolling average steam or water to fuel ratio, as measured by the continuous monitoring system, falls below the acceptable steam or water to fuel ratio needed to demonstrate compliance with § 60.4320, as established during the performance test required in § 60.8. Any unit operating hour in which no water or steam is injected into the turbine when a fuel is being burned that requires water or steam injection for NOX control will also be considered an excess emission.
                (2) A period of monitor downtime is any unit operating hour in which water or steam is injected into the turbine, but the essential parametric data needed to determine the steam or water to fuel ratio are unavailable or invalid.
                (3) Each report must include the average steam or water to fuel ratio, average fuel consumption, and the combustion turbine load during each excess emission.
                (b) For turbines using continuous emission monitoring, as described in §§ 60.4335(b) and 60.4345:

                (1) An excess emissions is any unit operating period in which the 4-hour or 30-day rolling average NOX emission rate exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 60.4320. For the purposes of this subpart, a “4-hour rolling average NOX emission rate” is the arithmetic average of the average NOX emission rate in ppm or ng/J (lb/MWh) measured by the continuous emission monitoring equipment for a given hour and the three unit operating hour average NOX emission rates immediately preceding that unit operating hour. Calculate the rolling average if a valid NOX emission rate is obtained for at least 3 of the 4 hours. For the purposes of this subpart, a “30-day rolling average NOX emission rate” is the arithmetic average of all hourly NOX emission data in ppm or ng/J (lb/MWh) measured by the continuous emission monitoring equipment for a given day and the twenty-nine unit operating days immediately preceding that unit operating day. A new 30-day average is calculated each unit operating day as the average of all hourly NOX emissions rates for the preceding 30 unit operating days if a valid NOX emission rate is obtained for at least 75 percent of all operating hours.

                (2) A period of monitor downtime is any unit operating hour in which the data for any of the following parameters are either missing or invalid: NOX concentration, CO2 or O2 concentration, fuel flow rate, steam flow rate, steam temperature, steam pressure, or megawatts. The steam flow rate, steam temperature, and steam pressure are only required if you will use this information for compliance purposes.

                (3) For operating periods during which multiple emissions standards apply, the applicable standard is the average of the applicable standards during each hour. For hours with multiple emissions standards, the applicable limit for that hour is determined based on the condition that corresponded to the highest emissions standard.
                

                (c) For turbines required to monitor combustion parameters or parameters that document proper operation of the NOX emission controls:
                (1) An excess emission is a 4-hour rolling unit operating hour average in which any monitored parameter does not achieve the target value or is outside the acceptable range defined in the parameter monitoring plan for the unit.
                (2) A period of monitor downtime is a unit operating hour in which any of the required parametric data are either not recorded or are invalid.
              
              
                § 60.4385
                How are excess emissions and monitoring downtime defined for SO2?
                If you choose the option to monitor the sulfur content of the fuel, excess emissions and monitoring downtime are defined as follows:
                (a) For samples of gaseous fuel and for oil samples obtained using daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling from the unit's storage tank, an excess emission occurs each unit operating hour included in the period beginning on the date and hour of any sample for which the sulfur content of the fuel being fired in the combustion turbine exceeds the applicable limit and ending on the date and hour that a subsequent sample is taken that demonstrates compliance with the sulfur limit.
                (b) If the option to sample each delivery of fuel oil has been selected, you must immediately switch to one of the other oil sampling options (i.e., daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling from the unit's storage tank) if the sulfur content of a delivery exceeds 0.05 weight percent. You must continue to use one of the other sampling options until all of the oil from the delivery has been combusted, and you must evaluate excess emissions according to paragraph (a) of this section. When all of the fuel from the delivery has been burned, you may resume using the as-delivered sampling option.
                (c) A period of monitor downtime begins when a required sample is not taken by its due date. A period of monitor downtime also begins on the date and hour of a required sample, if invalid results are obtained. The period of monitor downtime ends on the date and hour of the next valid sample.
              
              
                § 60.4390
                What are my reporting requirements if I operate an emergency combustion turbine or a research and development turbine?

                (a) If you operate an emergency combustion turbine, you are exempt from the NOX limit and must submit an initial report to the Administrator stating your case.

                (b) Combustion turbines engaged by manufacturers in research and development of equipment for both combustion turbine emission control techniques and combustion turbine efficiency improvements may be exempted from the NOX limit on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Administrator. You must petition for the exemption.
              
              
                § 60.4395
                When must I submit my reports?
                All reports required under § 60.7(c) must be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each 6-month period.
              
            
            
              Performance Tests
              
                § 60.4400

                How do I conduct the initial and subsequent performance tests, regarding NOX?

                (a) You must conduct an initial performance test, as required in § 60.8. Subsequent NOX performance tests shall be conducted on an annual basis (no more than 14 calendar months following the previous performance test).
                (1) There are two general methodologies that you may use to conduct the performance tests. For each test run:
                (i) Measure the NOX concentration (in parts per million (ppm)), using EPA Method 7E or EPA Method 20 in appendix A of this part. For units complying with the output based standard, concurrently measure the stack gas flow rate, using EPA Methods 1 and 2 in appendix A of this part, and measure and record the electrical and thermal output from the unit. Then, use the following equation to calculate the NOX emission rate:
                
                  
                  ER06JY06.004
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  E = NOX emission rate, in lb/MWh
                  1.194 × 10−7 = conversion constant, in lb/dscf-ppm
                  (NOX)c = average NOX concentration for the run, in ppm
                  Qstd = stack gas volumetric flow rate, in dscf/hr
                  P = gross electrical and mechanical energy output of the combustion turbine, in MW (for simple-cycle operation), for combined-cycle operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical output from the combustion and steam turbines, or, for combined heat and power operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical output from the combustion and steam turbines plus all useful recovered thermal output not used for additional electric or mechanical generation, in MW, calculated according to § 60.4350(f)(2); or
                
                
                (ii) Measure the NOX and diluent gas concentrations, using either EPA Methods 7E and 3A, or EPA Method 20 in appendix A of this part. Concurrently measure the heat input to the unit, using a fuel flowmeter (or flowmeters), and measure the electrical and thermal output of the unit. Use EPA Method 19 in appendix A of this part to calculate the NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu. Then, use Equations 1 and, if necessary, 2 and 3 in § 60.4350(f) to calculate the NOX emission rate in lb/MWh.
                (2) Sampling traverse points for NOX and (if applicable) diluent gas are to be selected following EPA Method 20 or EPA Method 1 (non-particulate procedures), and sampled for equal time intervals. The sampling must be performed with a traversing single-hole probe, or, if feasible, with a stationary multi-hole probe that samples each of the points sequentially. Alternatively, a multi-hole probe designed and documented to sample equal volumes from each hole may be used to sample simultaneously at the required points.
                (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you may test at fewer points than are specified in EPA Method 1 or EPA Method 20 in appendix A of this part if the following conditions are met:
                (i) You may perform a stratification test for NOX and diluent pursuant to
                (A) [Reserved], or
                (B) The procedures specified in section 6.5.6.1(a) through (e) of appendix A of part 75 of this chapter.
                (ii) Once the stratification sampling is completed, you may use the following alternative sample point selection criteria for the performance test:
                (A) If each of the individual traverse point NOX concentrations is within ±10 percent of the mean concentration for all traverse points, or the individual traverse point diluent concentrations differs by no more than ±5ppm or ±0.5 percent CO2 (or O2) from the mean for all traverse points, then you may use three points (located either 16.7, 50.0 and 83.3 percent of the way across the stack or duct, or, for circular stacks or ducts greater than 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the wall). The three points must be located along the measurement line that exhibited the highest average NOX concentration during the stratification test; or
                (B) For turbines with a NOX standard greater than 15 ppm @ 15% O2, you may sample at a single point, located at least 1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid if each of the individual traverse point NOX concentrations is within ±5 percent of the mean concentration for all traverse points, or the individual traverse point diluent concentrations differs by no more than ±3ppm or ±0.3 percent CO2 (or O2) from the mean for all traverse points; or
                (C) For turbines with a NOX standard less than or equal to 15 ppm @ 15% O2, you may sample at a single point, located at least 1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid if each of the individual traverse point NOX concentrations is within ±2.5 percent of the mean concentration for all traverse points, or the individual traverse point diluent concentrations differs by no more than ±1ppm or ±0.15 percent CO2 (or O2) from the mean for all traverse points.
                
                (b) The performance test must be done at any load condition within plus or minus 25 percent of 100 percent of peak load. You may perform testing at the highest achievable load point, if at least 75 percent of peak load cannot be achieved in practice. You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test. The minimum time per run is 20 minutes.
                (1) If the stationary combustion turbine combusts both oil and gas as primary or backup fuels, separate performance testing is required for each fuel.

                (2) For a combined cycle and CHP turbine systems with supplemental heat (duct burner), you must measure the total NOX emissions after the duct burner rather than directly after the turbine. The duct burner must be in operation during the performance test.

                (3) If water or steam injection is used to control NOX with no additional post-combustion NOX control and you choose to monitor the steam or water to fuel ratio in accordance with § 60.4335, then that monitoring system must be operated concurrently with each EPA Method 20 or EPA Method 7E run and must be used to determine the fuel consumption and the steam or water to fuel ratio necessary to comply with the applicable § 60.4320 NOX emission limit.

                (4) Compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 60.4320 must be demonstrated at each tested load level. Compliance is achieved if the three-run arithmetic average NOX emission rate at each tested level meets the applicable emission limit in § 60.4320.
                (5) If you elect to install a CEMS, the performance evaluation of the CEMS may either be conducted separately or (as described in § 60.4405) as part of the initial performance test of the affected unit.
                (6) The ambient temperature must be greater than 0 °F during the performance test.
              
              
                § 60.4405

                How do I perform the initial performance test if I have chosen to install a NOX-diluent CEMS?
                If you elect to install and certify a NOX-diluent CEMS under § 60.4345, then the initial performance test required under § 60.8 may be performed in the following alternative manner:
                (a) Perform a minimum of nine RATA reference method runs, with a minimum time per run of 21 minutes, at a single load level, within plus or minus 25 percent of 100 percent of peak load. The ambient temperature must be greater than 0 °F during the RATA runs.
                (b) For each RATA run, concurrently measure the heat input to the unit using a fuel flow meter (or flow meters) and measure the electrical and thermal output from the unit.

                (c) Use the test data both to demonstrate compliance with the applicable NOX emission limit under § 60.4320 and to provide the required reference method data for the RATA of the CEMS described under § 60.4335.

                (d) Compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 60.4320 is achieved if the arithmetic average of all of the NOX emission rates for the RATA runs, expressed in units of ppm or lb/MWh, does not exceed the emission limit.
              
              
                § 60.4410
                How do I establish a valid parameter range if I have chosen to continuously monitor parameters?

                If you have chosen to monitor combustion parameters or parameters indicative of proper operation of NOX emission controls in accordance with § 60.4340, the appropriate parameters must be continuously monitored and recorded during each run of the initial performance test, to establish acceptable operating ranges, for purposes of the parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit, as specified in § 60.4355.
              
              
                § 60.4415
                How do I conduct the initial and subsequent performance tests for sulfur?

                (a) You must conduct an initial performance test, as required in § 60.8. Subsequent SO2 performance tests shall be conducted on an annual basis (no more than 14 calendar months following the previous performance test). There are three methodologies that you may use to conduct the performance tests.

                (1) If you choose to periodically determine the sulfur content of the fuel combusted in the turbine, a representative fuel sample would be collected following ASTM D5287 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) for natural gas or ASTM D4177 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) for oil. Alternatively, for oil, you may follow the procedures for manual pipeline sampling in section 14 of ASTM D4057 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). The fuel analyses of this section may be performed either by you, a service contractor retained by you, the fuel vendor, or any other qualified agency. Analyze the samples for the total sulfur content of the fuel using:
                (i) For liquid fuels, ASTM D129, or alternatively D1266, D1552, D2622, D4294, or D5453 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see § 60.17); or
                (ii) For gaseous fuels, ASTM D1072, or alternatively D3246, D4084, D4468, D4810, D6228, D6667, or Gas Processors Association Standard 2377 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see § 60.17).
                (2) Measure the SO2 concentration (in parts per million (ppm)), using EPA Methods 6, 6C, 8, or 20 in appendix A of this part. In addition, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standard, ASME PTC 19-10-1981-Part 10, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” manual methods for sulfur dioxide (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) can be used instead of EPA Methods 6 or 20. For units complying with the output based standard, concurrently measure the stack gas flow rate, using EPA Methods 1 and 2 in appendix A of this part, and measure and record the electrical and thermal output from the unit. Then use the following equation to calculate the SO2 emission rate:
                
                  ER06JY06.005
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  E = SO2 emission rate, in lb/MWh
                  1.664 × 10−7 = conversion constant, in lb/dscf-ppm
                  (SO2)c = average SO2 concentration for the run, in ppm
                  Qstd = stack gas volumetric flow rate, in dscf/hr
                  P = gross electrical and mechanical energy output of the combustion turbine, in MW (for simple-cycle operation), for combined-cycle operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical output from the combustion and steam turbines, or, for combined heat and power operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical output from the combustion and steam turbines plus all useful recovered thermal output not used for additional electric or mechanical generation, in MW, calculated according to § 60.4350(f)(2); or
                
                
                (3) Measure the SO2 and diluent gas concentrations, using either EPA Methods 6, 6C, or 8 and 3A, or 20 in appendix A of this part. In addition, you may use the manual methods for sulfur dioxide ASME PTC 19-10-1981-Part 10 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). Concurrently measure the heat input to the unit, using a fuel flowmeter (or flowmeters), and measure the electrical and thermal output of the unit. Use EPA Method 19 in appendix A of this part to calculate the SO2 emission rate in lb/MMBtu. Then, use Equations 1 and, if necessary, 2 and 3 in § 60.4350(f) to calculate the SO2 emission rate in lb/MWh.

Mixing may occur before or in the combustion chamber. A lean premixed turbine may operate in diffusion flame mode during operating conditions such as startup and shutdown, extreme ambient temperature, or low or transient load.
                
                  Natural gas means a naturally occurring fluid mixture of hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, or propane) produced in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface that maintains a gaseous state at standard atmospheric temperature and pressure under ordinary conditions. Additionally, natural gas must either be composed of at least 70 percent methane by volume or have a gross calorific value between 950 and 1,100 British thermal units (Btu) per standard cubic foot. Natural gas does not include the following gaseous fuels: landfill gas, digester gas, refinery gas, sour gas, blast furnace gas, coal-derived gas, producer gas, coke oven gas, or any gaseous fuel produced in a process which might result in highly variable sulfur content or heating value.
                
                  Noncontinental area means the State of Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, or offshore platforms.

                  Regenerative cycle combustion turbine means any stationary combustion turbine which recovers heat from the combustion turbine exhaust gases to preheat the inlet combustion air to the combustion turbine.
                
                  Simple cycle combustion turbine means any stationary combustion turbine which does not recover heat from the combustion turbine exhaust gases to preheat the inlet combustion air to the combustion turbine, or which does not recover heat from the combustion turbine exhaust gases for purposes other than enhancing the performance of the combustion turbine itself.
                
                  Stationary combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not limited to the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas systems, control systems (except emissions control equipment), heat recovery system, and any ancillary components and sub-components comprising any simple cycle stationary combustion turbine, any regenerative/recuperative cycle stationary combustion turbine, any combined cycle combustion turbine, and any combined heat and power combustion turbine based system. Stationary means that the combustion turbine is not self propelled or intended to be propelled while performing its function. It may, however, be mounted on a vehicle for portability.
                
                  Unit operating day means a 24-hour period between 12 midnight and the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time in the unit. It is not necessary for fuel to be combusted continuously for the entire 24-hour period.
                
                  Unit operating hour means a clock hour during which any fuel is combusted in the affected unit. If the unit combusts fuel for the entire clock hour, it is considered to be a full unit operating hour. If the unit combusts fuel for only part of the clock hour, it is considered to be a partial unit operating hour.
                
                  Useful thermal output means the thermal energy made available for use in any industrial or commercial process, or used in any heating or cooling application, i.e., total thermal energy made available for processes and applications other than electrical or mechanical generation. Thermal output for this subpart means the energy in recovered thermal output measured against the energy in the thermal output at 15 degrees Celsius and 101.325 kilopascals of pressure.

            Subpart LLLL—Standards of Performance for New Sewage Sludge Incineration Units
            
              Source:
              76 FR 15404, Mar. 21, 2011, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              Introduction
              
                § 60.4760
                What does this subpart do?
                This subpart establishes new source performance standards for sewage sludge incineration (SSI) units. To the extent any requirement of this subpart is inconsistent with the requirements of subpart A of this part, the requirements of this subpart will apply.
              
              
                § 60.4765
                When does this subpart become effective?
                This subpart takes effect on September 21, 2011. Some of the requirements in this subpart apply to planning a SSI unit and must be completed even before construction is initiated on a SSI unit (i.e., the preconstruction requirements in §§ 60.4800 and 60.4805). Other requirements such as the emission limits, emission standards, and operating limits apply after the SSI unit begins operation.
              
            
            
              Applicability and Delegation of Authority
              
                § 60.4770
                Does this subpart apply to my sewage sludge incineration unit?
                Yes, your SSI unit is an affected source if it meets all the criteria specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

                (a) Your SSI unit is a SSI unit for which construction commenced after October 14, 2010 or for which modification commenced after September 21, 2011.
                (b) Your SSI unit is a SSI unit as defined in § 60.4930.
                (c) Your SSI unit is not exempt under § 60.4780.
              
              
                § 60.4775
                What is a new sewage sludge incineration unit?

                What if all the qualified operators are temporarily not accessible?
                If a qualified operator is not at the facility and cannot be at the facility within 1 hour, you must meet the criteria specified in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, depending on the length of time that a qualified operator is not accessible.
                (a) When a qualified operator is not accessible for more than 8 hours, the SSI unit may be operated for less than 2 weeks by other plant personnel who are familiar with the operation of the SSI unit and who have completed a review of the information specified in § 60.4840 within the past 12 months. However, you must record the period when a qualified operator was not accessible and include this deviation in the annual report as specified under § 60.4915(d).
                (b) When a qualified operator is not accessible for 2 weeks or more, you must take the two actions that are described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
                (1) Notify the Administrator of this deviation in writing within 10 days. In the notice, state what caused this deviation, what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, and when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible.
                (2) Submit a status report to the Administrator every 4 weeks outlining what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, stating when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible, and requesting approval from the Administrator to continue operation of the SSI unit. You must submit the first status report 4 weeks after you notify the Administrator of the deviation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
                (i) If the Administrator notifies you that your request to continue operation of the SSI unit is disapproved, the SSI unit may continue operation for 30 days, and then must cease operation.
                (ii) Operation of the unit may resume if a qualified operator is accessible as required under § 60.4810(a). You must notify the Administrator within 5 days of having resumed operations and of having a qualified operator accessible.
              
              
                § 60.4840

                (2) Subsequent annual reviews of the information listed in § 60.4910(c)(1) must be conducted no later than 12 months following the previous review.
              
            
            
              Emission Limits, Emission Standards, and Operating Limits and Requirements
              
                § 60.4845
                What emission limits and standards must I meet and by when?

                You must meet the emission limits and standards specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart within 60 days after your SSI unit reaches the feed rate at which it will operate or within 180 days after its initial startup, whichever comes first. The emission limits and standards apply at all times the unit is operating, and during periods of malfunction. The emission limits and standards apply to emissions from a bypass stack or vent while sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time).
              
              
                § 60.4850
                What operating limits and requirements must I meet and by when?

                You must meet, as applicable, the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of this section, according to the schedule specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The operating parameters for which you will establish operating limits for a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, or activated carbon injection are listed in Table 3 to this subpart. You must comply with the operating requirements in paragraph (f) of this section and the requirements in paragraph (g) of this section for meeting any new operating limits, re-established in § 60.4890. The operating limits apply at all times that sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time).
                (a) You must meet a site-specific operating limit for minimum operating temperature of the combustion chamber (or afterburner combustion chamber) that you establish in § 60.4890(a)(2)(i).
                (b) If you use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or activated carbon injection to comply with an emission limit, you must meet the site-specific operating limits that you establish in § 60.4870 for each operating parameter associated with each air pollution control device.
                (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limits, you must install the bag leak detection system specified in §§ 60.4880(b) and 60.4905(b)(3)(i) and operate the bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. You must calculate the alarm time as specified in § 60.4870.
                (d) You must meet the operating requirements in your site-specific fugitive emission monitoring plan, submitted as specified in § 60.4880(d) to ensure that your ash handling system will meet the emission standard for fugitive emissions from ash handling.

                (f) You must monitor the feed rate and moisture content of the sewage sludge fed to the sewage sludge incinerator, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.

                (1) Continuously monitor the sewage sludge feed rate and calculate a daily average for all hours of operation during each 24-hour period. Keep a record of the daily average feed rate, as specified in § 60.4910(f)(3)(ii).
                (2) Take at least one grab sample per day of the sewage sludge fed to the sewage sludge incinerator. If you take more than one grab sample in a day, calculate the daily average for the grab samples. Keep a record of the daily average moisture content, as specified in § 60.4910(f)(3)(ii).
                (g) For the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of this section, you must meet any new operating limits and requirements, re-established according to § 60.4890(d).
                (h) If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, or activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must meet any site-specific operating limits or requirements that you establish as required in § 60.4855.
              
              
                § 60.4855
                How do I establish operating limits if I do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, or activated carbon injection, or if I limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the emission limits?

                If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, or activated carbon injection, or limit emissions in some other manner (e.g., materials balance) to comply with the emission limits in § 60.4845, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
                (a) Meet the applicable operating limits and requirements in § 60.4850, and establish applicable operating limits according to § 60.4870.
                (b) Petition the Administrator for specific operating parameters, operating limits, and averaging periods to be established during the initial performance test and to be monitored continuously thereafter.
                (1) You are responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. You must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has been approved by the Administrator, and you must comply with the operating limits as written, pending approval by the Administrator. Neither submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves you of the responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart.
                (2) Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section.
                (i) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to monitor.
                (ii) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants.
                (iii) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters that will establish the operating limits on these parameters, including a discussion of the averaging periods associated with those parameters for determining compliance.
                (iv) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
                (v) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.
              
              
                § 60.4860
                Do the emission limits, emission standards, and operating limits apply during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?

                The emission limits and standards apply at all times and during periods of malfunction. The operating limits apply at all times that sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time).
              
              
                
                § 60.4861
                How do I establish an affirmative defense for exceedance of an emission limit or standard during malfunction?
                In response to an action to enforce the numerical emission standards set forth in paragraph § 60.4845, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of emission limits that are caused by malfunction, as defined in § 60.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
                (a) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(9) of this section are met.
                (1) The excess emissions meet:
                (i) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner, and
                (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices, and
                (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for, and
                (iv) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance, and (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limits were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs, and
                (3) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions, and
                (4) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage, and
                (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human health, and
                (6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, and
                (7) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, and
                (8) At all times, the affected facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions, and
                (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
                (b) The owner or operator of the SSI unit experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction, shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (fax) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in § 60.4845 to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.
              
            
            
              
              Initial Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.4865
                How and when do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and fugitive emissions from ash handling, and follow the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for carbon monoxide. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you also have the option to demonstrate initial compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, and lead. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 60.4900(a) and (b). Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, within 60 days after your SSI unit reaches the feed rate at which it will operate, or within 180 days after its initial startup, whichever comes first, you must demonstrate that your SSI unit meets the emission limits and standards specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
                (a) Demonstrate initial compliance using the performance test required in § 60.8. You must demonstrate that your SSI unit meets the emission limits and standards specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and fugitive emissions from ash handling using the performance test. The initial performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements specified in § 60.4900(a).

                (b) Demonstrate initial compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead is published in the Federal Register. The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register. Collect data as specified in § 60.4900(b)(6) and use the following procedures:
                (1) To demonstrate initial compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must use the carbon monoxide continuous emissions monitoring system specified in § 60.4900(b). For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7 percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7 percent oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.
                (2) To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the initial performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:

                (i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in lieu of conducting the initial performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section.
                
                (ii) You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the initial mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (3) If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, you must use the continuous emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in § 60.4900(b). You must measure emissions according to § 60.13 to calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide). You must demonstrate initial compliance using a 24-hour block average of these 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, calculated using Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (4) If you use a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you must:
                (i) Use the continuous automated sampling system specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q), and measure and calculate average emissions corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide) according to § 60.58b(p) and your monitoring plan.
                (A) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) to calculate 24-hour block averages to determine compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
                (B) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) to calculate 2-week block averages to determine compliance with the dioxin/furan (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
                (ii) Comply with the provisions in § 60.58b(q) to develop a monitoring plan. For mercury continuous automated sampling systems, you must use Performance Specification 12B of appendix B of part 75 and Procedure 5 of appendix F of this part.
                (5) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must complete your initial performance evaluations required under your monitoring plan for any continuous emissions monitoring system and continuous automated sampling systems according to the provisions of § 60.4880. Your performance evaluation must be conducted using the procedures and acceptance criteria specified in § 60.4880(a)(3).
                (c) To demonstrate initial compliance with the dioxins/furans toxic equivalency emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency as follows:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octachlorinated-isomer emitted using Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (2) Multiply the concentration of each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octa-chlorinated) isomer by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
                (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
                (d) Submit an initial compliance report, as specified in § 60.4915(c).
                (e) If you demonstrate initial compliance using the performance test specified in paragraph (a) of this section, then the provisions of this paragraph (e) apply. If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must notify the Administrator in writing as specified in § 60.4915(g). You must conduct the initial performance test as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs. The Administrator will determine whether or not to grant the extension to the initial performance test deadline, and will notify you in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable. Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator, you remain strictly subject to the requirements of this subpart.

                (2) If the application to use an alternate monitoring requirement is approved, you must continue to use the original monitoring requirement until approval is received to use another monitoring requirement.
                (3) You must submit the application for approval of alternate monitoring requirements no later than the notification of performance test. The application must contain the information specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section:
                (i) Data or information justifying the request, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality of using the required approach.
                (ii) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring requirement, including the operating parameter to be monitored, the monitoring approach and technique, the averaging period for the limit, and how the limit is to be calculated.

                (iii) Data or information documenting that the alternative monitoring requirement would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard.
                (4) The Administrator will notify you of the approval or denial of the application within 90 calendar days after receipt of the original request, or within 60 calendar days of the receipt of any supplementary information, whichever is later. The Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring application unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard. Before disapproving any alternate monitoring application, the Administrator will provide the following:
                (i) Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended disapproval is based.
                (ii) Notice of opportunity for you to present additional supporting information before final action is taken on the application. This notice will specify how much additional time is allowed for you to provide additional supporting information.
                (5) You are responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves you of the responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart.
                (6) The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case basis, that additional or alternative operating limits, or alternative approaches to establishing operating limits, are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.
                (f) You must submit your monitoring plans required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section at least 60 days before your initial performance evaluation of your continuous monitoring system(s).
                (g) You must submit your monitoring plan for your ash handling system, as required in paragraph (d) of this section, at least 60 days before your initial compliance test date.
                (h) You must update and resubmit your monitoring plan if there are any changes or potential changes in your monitoring procedures or if there is a process change, as defined in § 60.4930.
              
            
            
              Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.4885
                How and when do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and fugitive emissions from ash handling, and follow the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for carbon monoxide. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you also have the option to demonstrate continuous compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, and lead. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 60.4900(a) and (b). You may also petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
                (a) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a performance test. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (e) of this section, following the date that the initial performance test for each pollutant in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart except carbon monoxide is completed, you must conduct a performance test for each such pollutant on an annual basis (between 11 and 13 calendar months following the previous performance test). The performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements specified in § 60.4900(a).

                (1) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits to apply from that point forward. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
                (2) You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process change, as defined in § 60.4930.
                (3) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, you can conduct performance tests less often for a given pollutant, as specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) You can conduct performance tests less often if your performance tests for the pollutant for at least 2 consecutive years show that your emissions are at or below 75 percent of the emission limit specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, and there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year and no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
                (ii) If your SSI unit continues to meet the emission limit for the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year if your emissions are at or below 75 percent of the emission limit, and if there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions, but each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
                (iii) If a performance test shows emissions exceeded 75 percent of the emission limit for a pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over 2 consecutive years show compliance.

                (b) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead is published in the Federal Register. The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register. Collect data as specified in § 60.4900(b)(6) and use the following procedures:
                (1) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the carbon monoxide emission limit, you must use the carbon monoxide continuous emissions monitoring system specified in § 60.4900(b). For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7 percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7 percent oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.
                (2) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the annual performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:
                (i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in lieu of conducting the annual performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (ii) You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the annual mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this section.

                (3) If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, you must use the continuous emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in § 60.4900(b). You must measure emissions according to § 60.13 to calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide). You must demonstrate initial compliance using a 24-hour block average of these 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, calculated using Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (4) If you use a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you must:
                (i) Use the continuous automated sampling system specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q), and measure and calculate average emissions corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide) according to § 60.58b(p) and your monitoring plan.
                (A) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) to calculate 24-hour averages to determine compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
                (B) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) to calculate 2-week averages to determine compliance with the dioxin/furan emission limit (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
                (ii) Update your monitoring plan as specified in § 60.4880(e). For mercury continuous automated sampling systems, you must use Performance Specification 12B of appendix B of part 75 and Procedure 5 of appendix F of this part.
                (5) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must complete your periodic performance evaluations required under your monitoring plan for any continuous emissions monitoring system and continuous automated sampling systems, according to the schedule specified in your monitoring plan. If you were previously determining compliance by conducting an annual performance test (or according to the less frequent testing for a pollutant as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), you must complete the initial performance evaluation required in your monitoring plan in § 60.4880 for the continuous monitoring system prior to using the continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance or continuous automated sampling system. Your performance evaluation must be conducted using the procedures and acceptance criteria specified in § 60.4880(a)(3).
                (c) To demonstrate compliance with the dioxins/furans toxic equivalency emission limit in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency as follows:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octa-chlorinated isomer emitted using EPA Method 23.
                (2) For each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octa-chlorinated) isomer measured in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, multiply the isomer concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
                (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
                (d) You must submit the annual compliance report specified in § 60.4915(d). You must submit the deviation report specified in § 60.4915(e) for each instance that you did not meet each emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
                (e) If you demonstrate continuous compliance using a performance test, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, then the provisions of this paragraph (e) apply. If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must notify the Administrator in writing as specified in § 60.4915(g). You must conduct the performance test as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs. The Administrator will determine whether or not to grant the extension to the performance test deadline, and will notify you in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable. Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator, you remain strictly subject to the requirements of this subpart.

                (f) After any initial requests in § 60.4880 for alternative monitoring requirements for initial compliance, you may subsequently petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as specified in §§ 60.13(i) and 60.4880(e).
              
              
                § 60.4890
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with my operating limits?
                You must continuously monitor your operating parameters as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, according to the monitoring and calibration requirements in § 60.4905. You must confirm and re-establish your operating limits as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (a) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section using the continuous monitoring equipment and according to the procedures specified in § 60.4905 or established in § 60.4855. To determine compliance, you must use the data averaging period specified in Table 3 to this subpart (except for alarm time of the baghouse leak detection system) unless a different averaging period is established under § 60.4855.
                (1) You must demonstrate that the SSI unit meets the operating limits established according to §§ 60.4855 and 60.4870 and paragraph (d) of this section for each applicable operating parameter.
                (2) You must demonstrate that the SSI unit meets the operating limit for bag leak detection systems as follows:
                (i) For a bag leak detection system, you must calculate the alarm time as follows:
                (A) If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted.
                (B) If corrective action is required, each alarm time shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour.

                (C) If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, each alarm time (i.e., time that the alarm sounds) is counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.
                (ii) Your maximum alarm time is equal to 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period, as specified in § 60.4850(c).
                (b) Operation above the established maximum, below the established minimum, or outside the allowable range of the operating limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a deviation from your operating limits established under this subpart, except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission and operating limits or to establish new operating limits. You must submit the deviation report specified in § 60.4915(e) for each instance that you did not meet one of your operating limits established under this subpart.
                (c) You must submit the annual compliance report specified in § 60.4915(d) to demonstrate continuous compliance.
                (d) You must confirm your operating limits according to paragraph (d)(1) of this section or re-establish operating limits according to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Your operating limits must be established so as to assure ongoing compliance with the emission limits. These requirements also apply to your operating requirements in your fugitive emissions monitoring plan specified in § 60.4850(d).
                (1) Your operating limits must be based on operating data recorded during any performance test required in § 60.4885(a) or any performance evaluation required in § 60.4885(b)(5).
                (2) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits to apply from that point forward.
              
              
                § 60.4895
                By what date must I conduct annual air pollution control device inspections and make any necessary repairs?
                (a) You must conduct an annual inspection of each air pollution control device used to comply with the emission limits, according to § 60.4900(c), no later than 12 months following the previous annual air pollution control device inspection.
                (b) Within 10 operating days following an air pollution control device inspection, all necessary repairs must be completed unless you obtain written approval from the Administrator establishing a date whereby all necessary repairs of the affected SSI unit must be completed.
              
            
            
              
              Performance Testing, Monitoring, and Calibration Requirements
              
                § 60.4900
                What are the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements for compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                You must meet, as applicable, the performance testing requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the air pollution control device inspections requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the bypass stack provisions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (a) Performance testing requirements. (1) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations, as specified in § 60.8(c). Emissions in excess of the emission limits or standards during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction are considered deviations from the applicable emission limits or standards.
                (2) You must document that the dry sludge burned during the performance test is representative of the sludge burned under normal operating conditions by:
                (i) Maintaining a log of the quantity of sewage sludge burned during the performance test by continuously monitoring and recording the average hourly rate that sewage sludge is fed to the incinerator.
                (ii) Maintaining a log of the moisture content of the sewage sludge burned during the performance test by taking grab samples of the sewage sludge fed to the incinerator for each 8 hour period that testing is conducted.
                (3) All performance tests must be conducted using the test methods, minimum sampling volume, observation period, and averaging methods specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
                (4) Method 1 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1 must be used to select the sampling location and number of traverse points.
                (5) Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2 must be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2 must be used simultaneously with each method.
                (6) All pollutant concentrations must be adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:
                
                  ER21MR11.019
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = Pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen.
                  Cmeas = Pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis.
                  (20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen−7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis).
                  20.9 = Oxygen concentration in air, percent.
                  %O2 = Oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
                
                
                (7) Performance tests must be conducted and data reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in this subpart unless the Administrator does one of the following.
                (i) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a method with minor changes in methodology.
                (ii) Approves the use of an equivalent method.
                (iii) Approves the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in compliance.
                (iv) Waives the requirement for performance tests because you have demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected SSI unit is in compliance with the standard.
                (v) Approves shorter sampling times and smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. Nothing in this paragraph is construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Clean Air Act.

                (8) You must provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, you must notify the Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.
                (9) You must provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:
                (i) Sampling ports adequate for the test methods applicable to the SSI unit, as follows:
                (A) Constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures.
                (B) Providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.
                (ii) Safe sampling platform(s).
                (iii) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
                (iv) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
                (10) Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each performance test must consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run must be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. Compliance with each emission limit must be determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the three runs. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond your control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.
                (11) During each test run specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must operate your sewage sludge incinerator at a minimum of 85 percent of your maximum permitted capacity.
                (b) Continuous monitor requirements. You must meet the following requirements, as applicable, when using a continuous monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead is published in the Federal Register. If you elect to use a continuous emissions monitoring system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section. If you elect to use a continuous automated sampling system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(7) of this section. The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register.
                
                (1) You must notify the Administrator one month before starting use of the continuous monitoring system.
                (2) You must notify the Administrator one month before stopping use of the continuous monitoring system, in which case you must also conduct a performance test prior to ceasing operation of the system.
                (3) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the emissions to the atmosphere in accordance with the following:
                (i) Section 60.13 of subpart A of this part.
                (ii) The following performance specifications of appendix B of this part, as applicable:

                (E) For mercury, Performance Specification 12A of appendix B of this part.
                (F) For nitrogen oxides, Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part.
                (G) For sulfur dioxide, Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part.

                (iii) For continuous emissions monitoring systems, the quality assurance procedures (e.g., quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests) of appendix F of this part specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) through (b)(3)(iii)(G) of this section. For each pollutant, the span value of the continuous emissions monitoring system is two times the applicable emission limit, expressed as a concentration.
                (A) For particulate matter, Procedure 2 in appendix F of this part.
                (B) For hydrogen chloride, Procedure 1 in appendix F of this part except that the Relative Accuracy Test Audit requirements of Procedure 1 shall be replaced with the validation requirements and criteria of sections 11.1.1 and 12.0 of Performance Specification 15 of appendix B of this part.
                (C) For carbon monoxide, Procedure 1 in appendix F of this part.
                (D) [Reserved]

              Introduction
              
                § 60.5000
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance schedules for the control of emissions from sewage sludge incineration (SSI) units. The pollutants addressed by these emission guidelines are listed in Tables 2 and 3 to this subpart. These emission guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part. To the extent any requirement of this subpart is inconsistent with the requirements of subpart A of this part, the requirements of this subpart will apply.
              
              
                § 60.5005
                Am I affected by this subpart?
                (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a state or United States protectorate with one or more SSI units that commenced construction on or before October 14, 2010, you must submit a state plan to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (b) You must submit the state plan to EPA by March 21, 2012.
              
              
                § 60.5010
                Is a state plan required for all states?
                No. You are not required to submit a state plan if there are no SSI units for which construction commenced on or before October 14, 2010 in your state, and you submit a negative declaration letter in place of the state plan.
              
              
                § 60.5015
                What must I include in my state plan?
                (a) You must include the nine items described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(9) of this section in your state plan.
                (1) Inventory of affected SSI units, including those that have ceased operation but have not been dismantled.
                (2) Inventory of emissions from affected SSI units in your state.
                (3) Compliance schedules for each affected SSI unit.
                (4) Emission limits, emission standards, operator training and qualification requirements, and operating limits for affected SSI units that are at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (5) Performance testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
                (6) Certification that the hearing on the state plan was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.
                (7) Provision for state progress reports to EPA.
                (8) Identification of enforceable state mechanisms that you selected for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart.

                (9) Demonstration of your state's legal authority to carry out the sections 111(d) and 129 state plan.
                
                (b) Your state plan may deviate from the format and content of the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. However, if your state plan does deviate in content, you must demonstrate that your state plan is at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Your state plan must address regulatory applicability, increments of progress for retrofit, operator training and qualification, emission limits and standards, performance testing, operating limits, monitoring, and recordkeeping and reporting.
                (c) You must follow the requirements of subpart B of this part (Adoption and Submittal of state plans for Designated Facilities) in your state plan.
              
              
                § 60.5020
                Is there an approval process for my state plan?
                Yes. The EPA will review your state plan according to § 60.27.
              
              
                § 60.5025
                What if my state plan is not approvable?
                If you do not submit an approvable state plan (or a negative declaration letter) by March 21, 2013, EPA will develop a Federal plan according to § 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of SSI units not covered by an approved state plan must comply with the Federal plan. The Federal plan is an interim action and will be automatically withdrawn when your state plan is approved.
              
              
                § 60.5030
                Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?

                No. The EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, EPA will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the Federal Register. If, at a later date, a SSI unit for which construction commenced on or before October 14, 2010 is found in your state, the Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart would automatically apply to that SSI unit until your state plan is approved.
              
              
                § 60.5035
                What compliance schedule must I include in my state plan?
                (a) For SSI units that commenced construction on or before October 14, 2010, your state plan must include compliance schedules that require SSI units to achieve final compliance as expeditiously as practicable after approval of the state plan but not later than the earlier of the two dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
                (1) March 21, 2016.
                (2) Three years after the effective date of state plan approval.
                (b) For compliance schedules that extend more than 1 year following the effective date of state plan approval, state plans must include dates for enforceable increments of progress as specified in § 60.5090.
              
              
                § 60.5040
                Are there any state plan requirements for this subpart that apply instead of the requirements specified in subpart B?
                Yes. Subpart B establishes general requirements for developing and processing section 111(d) state plans. This subpart applies instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part, as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
                (a) State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State plans must require all SSI units to comply by the dates specified in § 60.5035. This applies instead of the option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in § 60.24(f).
                (b) State plans developed to implement this subpart are required to include two increments of progress for the affected SSI units. These two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal date and final compliance date in § 60.21(h)(1) and (5). This applies instead of the requirement of § 60.24(e)(1) that would require a state plan to include all five increments of progress for all SSI units.
              
              
                
                § 60.5045
                In lieu of a state plan submittal, are there other acceptable option(s) for a state to meet its section 111(d)/129 (b)(2) obligations?
                Yes, a state may meet its Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the Federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its section 111(d)/129 obligations.
                (a) An acceptable Federal plan delegation request must include the following:
                (1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the Federal plan.
                (2) The items under § 60.5015(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(7).
                (3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.
                (4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator that sets forth the terms, conditions, and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in EPA's Delegation Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)/(2)/129 (b)(3) Federal plans.
                (b) A state with an already approved SSI Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the revised Federal plan, provided the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of EPA's previous state plan approval.
                (c) A state's Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under title V of the Clean Air Act.
              
              
                § 60.5050
                What authorities will not be delegated to state, local, or tribal agencies?
                The authorities that will not be delegated to state, local, or tribal agencies are specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.
                (a) Approval of alternatives to the emission limits and standards in Tables 2 and 3 to this subpart and operating limits established under § 60.5175 or § 60.5190.
                (b) Approval of major alternatives to test methods.
                (c) Approval of major alternatives to monitoring.
                (d) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting.
                (e) The requirements in § 60.5175.
                (f) The requirements in § 60.5155(b)(2).
                (g) Performance test and data reduction waivers under § 60.8(b).
              
              
                § 60.5055
                Does this subpart directly affect SSI unit owners and operators in my state?
                (a) No. This subpart does not directly affect SSI unit owners and operators in your state. However, SSI unit owners and operators must comply with the state plan you develop to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. States may choose to incorporate the model rule text directly in their state plan.
                (b) If you do not submit an approvable plan to implement and enforce the guidelines contained in this subpart by March 21, 2012, EPA will implement and enforce a Federal plan, as provided in § 60.5025, to ensure that each unit within your state that commenced construction on or before October 14, 2010 reaches compliance with all the provisions of this subpart by the dates specified in § 60.5035.
              
            
            
              Applicability of State Plans
              
                § 60.5060
                What SSI units must I address in my state plan?
                (a) Your state plan must address SSI units that meet all three criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) SSI units in your state that commenced construction on or before October 14, 2010.
                (2) SSI units that meet the definition of a SSI unit as defined in § 60.5250.
                (3) SSI units not exempt under § 60.5065.

                (b) If the owner or operator of a SSI unit makes changes that meet the definition of modification after September 21, 2011, the SSI unit becomes subject to subpart LLLL of this part and the state plan no longer applies to that unit.
                (c) If the owner or operator of a SSI unit makes physical or operational changes to a SSI unit for which construction commenced on or before September 21, 2011 primarily to comply with your state plan, subpart LLLL of this part does not apply to that unit. Such changes do not qualify as modifications under subpart LLLL of this part.
              
              
                § 60.5065
                What SSI units are exempt from my state plan?

                This subpart exempts combustion units that incinerate sewage sludge and are not located at a wastewater treatment facility designed to treat domestic sewage sludge. These units may be subject to another subpart of this part (e.g., subpart CCCC of this part). The owner or operator of such a combustion unit must notify the Administrator of an exemption claim under this section.
              
            
            
              Use of Model Rule
              
                § 60.5070
                What is the “model rule” in this subpart?
                (a) The model rule is the portion of these emission guidelines (§§ 60.5085 through 60.5250) that addresses the regulatory requirements applicable to SSI units. The model rule provides these requirements in regulation format. You must develop a state plan that is at least as protective as the model rule. You may use the model rule language as part of your state plan. Alternative language may be used in your state plan if you demonstrate that the alternative language is at least as protective as the model rule contained in this subpart.
                (b) In the model rule of §§ 60.5085 through 60.5250, “you” and “Administrator” have the meaning specified in § 60.5250.
              
              
                § 60.5075

                How do I renew my lapsed operator qualification?
                You must renew a lapsed operator qualification before you begin operation of a SSI unit by one of the two methods specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
                (a) For a lapse of less than 3 years, you must complete a standard annual refresher course described in § 60.5145.
                (b) For a lapse of 3 years or more, you must repeat the initial qualification requirements in § 60.5140(a).
              
              
                § 60.5155
                What if all the qualified operators are temporarily not accessible?
                If a qualified operator is not at the facility and cannot be at the facility within 1 hour, you must meet the criteria specified in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, depending on the length of time that a qualified operator is not accessible.

                (a) When a qualified operator is not accessible for more than 8 hours, the SSI unit may be operated for less than 2 weeks by other plant personnel who are familiar with the operation of the SSI unit and who have completed a review of the information specified in § 60.5160 within the past 12 months. However, you must record the period when a qualified operator was not accessible and include this deviation in the annual report as specified under § 60.5235(d).
                
                (b) When a qualified operator is not accessible for 2 weeks or more, you must take the two actions that are described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
                (1) Notify the Administrator of this deviation in writing within 10 days. In the notice, state what caused this deviation, what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, and when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible.
                (2) Submit a status report to the Administrator every 4 weeks outlining what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, stating when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible, and requesting approval from the Administrator to continue operation of the SSI unit. You must submit the first status report 4 weeks after you notify the Administrator of the deviation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
                (i) If the Administrator notifies you that your request to continue operation of the SSI unit is disapproved, the SSI unit may continue operation for 30 days, and then must cease operation.
                (ii) Operation of the unit may resume if a qualified operator is accessible as required under § 60.5130(a). You must notify the Administrator within 5 days of having resumed operations and of having a qualified operator accessible.
              
              
                § 60.5160
                What site-specific documentation is required and how often must it be reviewed by qualified operators and plant personnel?
                (a) You must maintain at the facility the documentation of the operator training procedures specified under § 60.5230(c)(1) and make the documentation readily accessible to all SSI unit operators.
                (b) You must establish a program for reviewing the information listed in § 60.5230(c)(1) with each qualified incinerator operator and other plant personnel who may operate the unit according to the provisions of § 60.5155(a), according to the following schedule:

                (2) Subsequent annual reviews of the information listed in § 60.5230(c)(1) must be conducted no later than 12 months following the previous review.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Emission Limits, Emission Standards, and Operating Limits and Requirements
              
                § 60.5165
                What emission limits and standards must I meet and by when?

                You must meet the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart by the final compliance date under the approved state plan, Federal plan, or delegation, as applicable. The emission limits and standards apply at all times the unit is operating and during periods of malfunction. The emission limits and standards apply to emissions from a bypass stack or vent while sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time).
              
              
                § 60.5170
                What operating limits and requirements must I meet and by when?

                You must meet, as applicable, the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of this section, according to the schedule specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The operating parameters for which you will establish operating limits for a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, or activated carbon injection are listed in Table 4 to this subpart. You must comply with the operating requirements in paragraph (f) of this section and the requirements in paragraph (g) of this section for meeting any new operating limits, re-established in § 60.5210. The operating limits apply at all times that sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time).

                (a) You must meet a site-specific operating limit for minimum operating temperature of the combustion chamber (or afterburner combustion chamber) that you establish in § 60.5190.
                (b) If you use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, activated carbon injection, or afterburner to comply with an emission limit, you must meet the site-specific operating limits that you establish in § 60.5190 for each operating parameter associated with each air pollution control device.

                (1) Continuously monitor the sewage sludge feed rate and calculate a daily average for all hours of operation during each 24-hour period. Keep a record of the daily average feed rate, as specified in § 60.5230(f)(3)(ii).
                (2) Take at least one grab sample per day of the sewage sludge fed to the sewage sludge incinerator. If you take more than one grab sample in a day, calculate the daily average for the grab samples. Keep a record of the daily average moisture content, as specified in § 60.5230(f)(3)(ii).
                (g) For the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of this section, you must meet any new operating limits and requirements, re-established according to § 60.5210(d).
                (h) If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, or activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, you must meet any site-specific operating limits or requirements that you establish as required in § 60.5175.
              
              
                § 60.5175
                How do I establish operating limits if I do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, activated carbon injection, or afterburner, or if I limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the emission limits?

                If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, activated carbon injection, or afterburner, or limit emissions in some other manner (e.g., materials balance) to comply with the emission limits in § 60.5165, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
                (a) Meet the applicable operating limits and requirements in § 60.4850, and establish applicable operating limits according to § 60.5190.
                (b) Petition the Administrator for specific operating parameters, operating limits, and averaging periods to be established during the initial performance test and to be monitored continuously thereafter.
                (1) You are responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. You must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has been approved by the Administrator, and you must comply with the operating limits as written, pending approval by the Administrator. Neither submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves you of the responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart.
                (2) Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(v) of this section.

                (i) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to monitor.
                
                (ii) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants.
                (iii) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters that will establish the operating limits on these parameters, including a discussion of the averaging periods associated with those parameters for determining compliance.
                (iv) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
                (v) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.
              
              
                § 60.5180
                Do the emission limits, emission standards, and operating limits apply during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?

                The emission limits and standards apply at all times and during periods of malfunction. The operating limits apply at all times that sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time). For determining compliance with the CO concentration limit using CO CEMS, the correction to 7 percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured CO concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other CO concentrations (corrected to 7 percent O2) to determine the 24-hour average value.
              
              
                § 60.5181
                How do I establish an affirmative defense for exceedance of an emission limit or standard during malfunction?
                In response to an action to enforce the numerical emission standards set forth in paragraph § 60.5165, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of emission limits that are caused by malfunction, as defined in § 60.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
                (a) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(9) of this section are met.
                (1) The excess emissions:
                (i) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner, and (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices, and (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for, and
                (iv) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance, and
                (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limits were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs, and (3) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions, and (4) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage, and
                (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human health, and
                (6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, and

                (7) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, and
                (8) At all times, the affected facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions, and
                (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
                (b) The owner or operator of the SSI unit experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction, shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (fax) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in § 60.5165 to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.
              
            
            
              Model Rule—Initial Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.5185
                How and when do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you have the option to demonstrate initial compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and fugitive emissions from ash handling. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 60.5220(a) and (b).
                (a) Demonstrate initial compliance using the performance test required in § 60.8. You must demonstrate that your SSI unit meets the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and fugitive emissions from ash handling using the performance test. The initial performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements specified in § 60.5220(a).
                (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must demonstrate that your SSI unit meets the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart by your final compliance date (see Table 1 to this subpart).

                (2) You may use the results from a performance test conducted within the 2 previous years that was conducted under the same conditions and demonstrated compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, provided no process changes have been made since you conducted that performance test. However, you must continue to meet the operating limits established during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart. The performance test must have used the test methods specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.

                (b) Demonstrate initial compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead is published in the Federal Register. The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register. Collect data as specified in § 60.5220(b)(6) and use the following procedures:
                (1) To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the initial performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:
                (i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in lieu of conducting the initial performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section. For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7 percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7 percent oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.
                (ii) You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the annual mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (2) If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must use the continuous emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in § 60.5220(b). You must measure emissions according to § 60.13 to calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide). You must demonstrate initial compliance using a 24-hour block average of these 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, calculated using Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (3) If you use a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must:
                (i) Use the continuous automated sampling system specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q), and measure and calculate average emissions corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide) according to § 60.58b(p) and your monitoring plan.
                (A) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) to calculate 24-hour block averages to determine compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart.
                (B) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) to calculate 2-week block averages to determine compliance with the dioxin/furan (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart.
                (ii) Comply with the provisions in § 60.58b(q) to develop a monitoring plan. For mercury continuous automated sampling systems, you must use Performance Specification 12B of appendix B of part 75 and Procedure 5 of appendix F of this part.

                (4) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must complete your initial performance evaluations required under your monitoring plan for any continuous emissions monitoring systems and continuous automated sampling systems by your final compliance date (see Table 1 to this subpart). Your performance evaluation must be conducted using the procedures and acceptance criteria specified in § 60.5200(a)(3).
                (c) To demonstrate initial compliance with the dioxins/furans toxic equivalency emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency as follows:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octachlorinated-isomer emitted using EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (2) Multiply the concentration of each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octa-chlorinated) isomer by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 5 to this subpart. (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
                (d) Submit an initial compliance report, as specified in § 60.5235(b).
                (e) If you demonstrate initial compliance using the performance test specified in paragraph (a) of this section, then the provisions of this paragraph (e) apply. If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must notify the Administrator in writing as specified in § 60.5235(g). You must conduct the initial performance test as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs. The Administrator will determine whether or not to grant the extension to the initial performance test deadline, and will notify you in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable. Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator, you remain strictly subject to the requirements of this subpart.

                (ii) When the continuous monitoring system is out of control as specified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, you must take the necessary corrective action and must repeat all necessary tests that indicate that the system is out of control. You must take corrective action and conduct retesting until the performance requirements are below the applicable limits. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour you conduct a performance check (e.g., calibration drift) that indicates an exceedance of the performance requirements established under this part. The end of the out-of-control period is the hour following the completion of corrective action and successful demonstration that the system is within the allowable limits.
                (8) Schedule for conducting initial and periodic performance evaluations of your continuous monitoring systems.
                (b) If a bag leak detection system is used, your monitoring plan must include a description of the following items:

                (2) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point will be established. Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will sound an alarm when the system detects an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level. The alarm must be located where it is observed readily and any alert is detected and recognized easily by plant operating personnel.
                (3) Evaluations of the performance of the bag leak detection system, performed in accordance with your monitoring plan and consistent with the guidance provided in Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance, EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17).

                (4) Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality assurance procedures.
                
                (5) Maintenance of the bag leak detection system, including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.
                (6) Recordkeeping (including record retention) of the bag leak detection system data. Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor. (c) You must conduct an initial performance evaluation of each continuous monitoring system and bag leak detection system, as applicable, in accordance with your monitoring plan and to § 60.13(c). For the purpose of this subpart, the provisions of § 60.13(c) also apply to the bag leak detection system.

                (d) You must submit a monitoring plan specifying the ash handling system operating procedures that you will follow to ensure that you meet the fugitive emissions limit specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
                (e) You may submit an application to the Administrator for approval of alternate monitoring requirements to demonstrate compliance with the standards of this subpart, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(6) of this section.
                (1) The Administrator will not approve averaging periods other than those specified in this section, unless you document, using data or information, that the longer averaging period will ensure that emissions do not exceed levels achieved over the duration of three performance test runs.
                (2) If the application to use an alternate monitoring requirement is approved, you must continue to use the original monitoring requirement until approval is received to use another monitoring requirement.
                (3) You must submit the application for approval of alternate monitoring requirements no later than the notification of performance test. The application must contain the information specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this section:
                (i) Data or information justifying the request, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality of using the required approach.
                (ii) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring requirement, including the operating parameter to be monitored, the monitoring approach and technique, the averaging period for the limit, and how the limit is to be calculated.
                (iii) Data or information documenting that the alternative monitoring requirement would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard.
                (4) The Administrator will notify you of the approval or denial of the application within 90 calendar days after receipt of the original request, or within 60 calendar days of the receipt of any supplementary information, whichever is later. The Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring application unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard. Before disapproving any alternate monitoring application, the Administrator will provide the following:
                (i) Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended disapproval is based.
                (ii) Notice of opportunity for you to present additional supporting information before final action is taken on the application. This notice will specify how much additional time is allowed for you to provide additional supporting information.
                (5) You are responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves you of the responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart.
                (6) The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case basis, that additional or alternative operating limits, or alternative approaches to establishing operating limits, are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.

                (f) You must submit your monitoring plans required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section at least 60 days before your initial performance evaluation of your continuous monitoring system(s).
                (g) You must submit your monitoring plan for your ash handling system, as required in paragraph (d) of this section, at least 60 days before your initial compliance test date.

              Model Rule—Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.5205
                How and when do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you have the option to demonstrate initial compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead, and fugitive emissions from ash handling. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 60.5220(a) and (b). You may also petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
                (a) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a performance test. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (e) of this section, following the date that the initial performance test for each pollutant in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart is completed, you must conduct a performance test for each such pollutant on an annual basis (between 11 and 13 calendar months following the previous performance test). The performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements specified in § 60.5220(a).
                (1) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits to apply from that point forward. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
                (2) You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process change, as defined in § 60.5250.
                (3) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, you can conduct performance tests less often for a given pollutant, as specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) You can conduct performance tests less often if your performance tests for the pollutant for at least 2 consecutive years show that your emissions are at or below 75 percent of the emission limit specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, and there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year and no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.(ii) If your SSI unit continues to meet the emission limit for the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year if your emissions are at or below 75 percent of the emission limit, and if there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions, but each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
                (iii) If a performance test shows emissions exceeded 75 percent of the emission limit for a pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over 2 consecutive years show compliance.

                (b) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead is published in the Federal Register. The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register. Collect data as specified in § 60.5220(b)(6) and use the following procedures:
                (1) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the annual performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:
                (i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in lieu of conducting the annual performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section. For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7 percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7 percent oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.
                (ii) You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the annual mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (2) If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must use the continuous emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in § 60.5220(b). You must measure emissions according to § 60.13 to calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide). You must demonstrate initial compliance using a 24-hour block average of these 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, calculated using Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (3) If you use a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must:
                (i) Use the continuous automated sampling system specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q), and measure and calculate average emissions corrected to 7 percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide) according to § 60.58b(p) and your monitoring plan.
                (A) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) to calculate 24-hour averages to determine compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart.
                (B) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) to calculate 2-week averages to determine compliance with the dioxin/furan (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart.
                (ii) Update your monitoring plan as specified in § 60.4880(e). For mercury continuous automated sampling systems, you must use Performance Specification 12B of appendix B of part 75 and Procedure 5 of appendix F of this part.

                (4) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must complete your periodic performance evaluations required in your monitoring plan for any continuous emissions monitoring systems and continuous automated sampling systems, according to the schedule specified in your monitoring plan. If you were previously determining compliance by conducting an annual performance test (or according to the less frequent testing for a pollutant as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), you must complete the initial performance evaluation required under your monitoring plan in § 60.5200 for the continuous monitoring system prior to using the continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance or continuous automated sampling system. Your performance evaluation must be conducted using the procedures and acceptance criteria specified in § 60.5200(a)(3).
                (c) To demonstrate compliance with the dioxins/furans toxic equivalency emission limit in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency as follows:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octachlorinated-isomer emitted using Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (2) For each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octachlorinated) isomer measured in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, multiply the isomer concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
                (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
                (d) You must submit an annual compliance report as specified in § 60.5235(c). You must submit a deviation report as specified in § 60.5235(d) for each instance that you did not meet each emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart.
                (e) If you demonstrate continuous compliance using a performance test, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, then the provisions of this paragraph (e) apply. If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must notify the Administrator in writing as specified in § 60.5235(g). You must conduct the performance test as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs. The Administrator will determine whether or not to grant the extension to the performance test deadline, and will notify you in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable. Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator, you remain strictly subject to the requirements of this subpart.
                (f) After any initial requests in § 60.5200 for alternative monitoring requirements for initial compliance, you may subsequently petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as specified in §§ 60.13(i) and 60.5200(e).
              
              
                § 60.5210
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with my operating limits?
                You must continuously monitor your operating parameters as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, according to the monitoring and calibration requirements in § 60.5225. You must confirm and re-establish your operating limits as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (a) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section using the continuous monitoring equipment and according to the procedures specified in § 60.5225 or established in § 60.5175. To determine compliance, you must use the data averaging period specified in Table 4 to this subpart (except for alarm time of the baghouse leak detection system) unless a different averaging period is established under § 60.5175.
                (1) You must demonstrate that the SSI unit meets the operating limits established according to §§ 60.5175 and 60.5190 and paragraph (d) of this section for each applicable operating parameter.
                (2) You must demonstrate that the SSI unit meets the operating limit for bag leak detection systems as follows:
                (i) For a bag leak detection system, you must calculate the alarm time as follows:
                (A) If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted.
                (B) If corrective action is required, each alarm time shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour.

                (C) If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, each alarm time (i.e., time that the alarm sounds) is counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.
                
                (ii) Your maximum alarm time is equal to 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period, as specified in § 60.5170(c).
                (b) Operation above the established maximum, below the established minimum, or outside the allowable range of the operating limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a deviation from your operating limits established under this subpart, except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission and operating limits or to establish new operating limits.

              Model Rule—Performance Testing, Monitoring, and Calibration Requirements
              
                § 60.5220
                What are the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements for compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                You must meet, as applicable, the performance testing requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the air pollution control device inspections requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the bypass stack provisions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (a) Performance testing requirements. (1) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations, as specified in § 60.8(c). Emissions in excess of the emission limits or standards during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction are considered deviations from the applicable emission limits or standards.
                (2) You must document that the dry sludge burned during the performance test is representative of the sludge burned under normal operating conditions by:
                (i) Maintaining a log of the quantity of sewage sludge burned during the performance test by continuously monitoring and recording the average hourly rate that sewage sludge is fed to the incinerator.
                (ii) Maintaining a log of the moisture content of the sewage sludge burned during the performance test by taking grab samples of the sewage sludge fed to the incinerator for each 8 hour period that testing is conducted.
                (3) All performance tests must be conducted using the test methods, minimum sampling volume, observation period, and averaging method specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.

                (4) Method 1 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A must be used to select the sampling location and number of traverse points.
                
                (5) Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2 must be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2 must be used simultaneously with each method.
                (6) All pollutant concentrations must be adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:
                
                  ER21MR11.020
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = Pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen.
                  Cmeas = Pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis.
                  (20.9 − 7) = 20.9 percent oxygen − 7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis).
                  20.9 = Oxygen concentration in air, percent.
                  %O2 = Oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
                
                
                (7) Performance tests must be conducted and data reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in this subpart unless the Administrator does one of the following.
                (i) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a method with minor changes in methodology.
                (ii) Approves the use of an equivalent method.
                (iii) Approves the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in compliance.
                (iv) Waives the requirement for performance tests because you have demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected SSI unit is in compliance with the standard.
                (v) Approves shorter sampling times and smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. Nothing in this paragraph is construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Clean Air Act.

                (8) You must provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, you must notify the Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.
                (9) You must provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:
                (i) Sampling ports adequate for the test methods applicable to the SSI unit, as follows:
                (A) Constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures.
                (B) Providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.
                (ii) Safe sampling platform(s).

                (iv) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.

                (10) Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each performance test must consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run must be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. Compliance with each emission limit must be determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the three runs. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond your control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.
                
                (11) During each test run specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must operate your sewage sludge incinerator at a minimum of 85 percent of your maximum permitted capacity.
                (b) Continuous monitor requirements. You must meet the following requirements, as applicable, when using a continuous monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead is published in the Federal Register. If you elect to use a continuous emissions monitoring system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section. If you elect to use a continuous automated sampling system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(7) of this section. The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register.
                
                (1) You must notify the Administrator 1 month before starting use of the continuous emissions monitoring system.
                (2) You must notify the Administrator 1 month before stopping use of the continuous emissions monitoring system, in which case you must also conduct a performance test within prior to ceasing operation of the system.
                (3) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the emissions to the atmosphere in accordance with the following:
                (i) Section 60.13 of subpart A of this part.
                (ii) The following performance specifications of appendix B of this part, as applicable:

                (5) You may request that compliance with the emission limits be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen. If carbon dioxide is selected for use in diluent corrections, the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels must be established during the initial performance test according to the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(iv) of this section. This relationship may be re-established during subsequent performance tests.

                (i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2 must be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3A or 3B at 50 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), as applicable, must be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor.

Any such periods that you do not collect data using the continuous monitoring system constitute a deviation from the monitoring requirements and must be reported in a deviation report.

                (ii) You must collect continuous emissions monitoring system data in accordance with § 60.13(e)(2).
                
                (iii) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities must not be included in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. Any such periods must be reported in a deviation report.
                (iv) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in § 60.4880(a)(7)(i), repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities conducted during out-of-control periods must not be included in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. Any such periods that do not coincide with a monitoring system malfunction as defined in § 60.5250, constitute a deviation from the monitoring requirements and must be reported in a deviation report.
                (v) You must use all the data collected during all periods except those periods specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(iii) and (b)(6)(iv) of this section in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
                (7) If you elect to use a continuous automated sampling system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must:
                (i) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous automated sampling system according to the site-specific monitoring plan developed in § 60.58b(p)(1) through (p)(6), (p)(9), (p)(10), and (q).

If more than one requirement triggers a source's obligation to apply for a title V permit, the 12-month timeframe for filing a title V permit application is triggered by the requirement which first causes the source to be subject to title V. (See section 503(c) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.3(a) and (b), 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(i), 40 CFR 71.3(a) and (b), and 40 CFR 71.5(a)(1)(i).)

                (d) A “complete” title V permit application is one that has been determined or deemed complete by the relevant permitting authority under section 503(d) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.5(a)(2) or 40 CFR 71.5(a)(2). You must submit a complete permit application by the relevant application deadline in order to operate after this date in compliance with Federal law. (See sections 503(d) and 502(a) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.7(b) and 40 CFR 71.7(b).)

              § 60.5365
              Am I subject to this subpart?

              You are subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart if you are the owner or operator of one or more of the onshore affected facilities listed in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section for which you commence construction, modification or reconstruction after August 23, 2011, and on or before September 18, 2015.
              (a) Each gas well affected facility, which is a single natural gas well.
              (b) Each centrifugal compressor affected facility, which is a single centrifugal compressor using wet seals that is located between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to the natural gas transmission and storage segment. A centrifugal compressor located at a well site, or an adjacent well site and servicing more than one well site, is not an affected facility under this subpart.
              (c) Each reciprocating compressor affected facility, which is a single reciprocating compressor located between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to the natural gas transmission and storage segment. A reciprocating compressor located at a well site, or an adjacent well site and servicing more than one well site, is not an affected facility under this subpart.
              (d)(1) For the oil production segment (between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to an oil pipeline), each pneumatic controller affected facility, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller operating at a natural gas bleed rate greater than 6 scfh.
              (2) For the natural gas production segment (between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer to the natural gas transmission and storage segment and not including natural gas processing plants), each pneumatic controller affected facility, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller operating at a natural gas bleed rate greater than 6 scfh.
              (3) For natural gas processing plants, each pneumatic controller affected facility, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller.
              (e) Each storage vessel affected facility, which is a single storage vessel located in the oil and natural gas production segment, natural gas processing segment or natural gas transmission and storage segment, and has the potential for VOC emissions equal to or greater than 6 tpy as determined according to this section by October 15, 2013 for Group 1 storage vessels and by April 15, 2014, or 30 days after startup (whichever is later) for Group 2 storage vessels, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section. The potential for VOC emissions must be calculated using a generally accepted model or calculation methodology, based on the maximum average daily throughput determined for a 30-day period of production prior to the applicable emission determination deadline specified in this section. The determination may take into account requirements under a legally and practically enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under a Federal, State, local or tribal authority.
              (1) For each new, modified or reconstructed storage vessel receiving liquids pursuant to the standards for gas well affected facilities in § 60.5375, including wells subject to § 60.5375(f), you must determine the potential for VOC emissions within 30 days after startup of production.
              (2) A storage vessel affected facility that subsequently has its potential for VOC emissions decrease to less than 6 tpy shall remain an affected facility under this subpart.
              (3) For storage vessels not subject to a legally and practically enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under Federal, state, local or tribal authority, any vapor from the storage vessel that is recovered and routed to a process through a VRU designed and operated as specified in this section is not required to be included in the determination of VOC potential to emit for purposes of determining affected facility status, provided you comply with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) You meet the cover requirements specified in § 60.5411(b).
              (ii) You meet the closed vent system requirements specified in § 60.5411(c).
              (iii) You maintain records that document compliance with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

              (iv) In the event of removal of apparatus that recovers and routes vapor to a process, or operation that is inconsistent with the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, you must determine the storage vessel's potential for VOC emissions according to this section within 30 days of such removal or operation.
              (4) The following requirements apply immediately upon startup, startup of production, or return to service. A storage vessel affected facility that is reconnected to the original source of liquids is a storage vessel affected facility subject to the same requirements that applied before being removed from service. Any storage vessel that is used to replace any storage vessel affected facility is subject to the same requirements that apply to the storage vessel affected facility being replaced.
              (5) A storage vessel with a capacity greater than 100,000 gallons used to recycle water that has been passed through two stage separation is not a storage vessel affected facility.
              (f) The group of all equipment, except compressors, within a process unit is an affected facility.
              (1) Addition or replacement of equipment for the purpose of process improvement that is accomplished without a capital expenditure shall not by itself be considered a modification under this subpart.
              (2) Equipment associated with a compressor station, dehydration unit, sweetening unit, underground storage vessel, field gas gathering system, or liquefied natural gas unit is covered by §§ 60.5400, 60.5401, 60.5402, 60.5421, and 60.5422 of this subpart if it is located at an onshore natural gas processing plant. Equipment not located at the onshore natural gas processing plant site is exempt from the provisions of §§ 60.5400, 60.5401, 60.5402, 60.5421, and 60.5422 of this subpart.
              (3) The equipment within a process unit of an affected facility located at onshore natural gas processing plants and described in paragraph (f) of this section are exempt from this subpart if they are subject to and controlled according to subparts VVa, GGG or GGGa of this part.
              (g) Sweetening units located at onshore natural gas processing plants that process natural gas produced from either onshore or offshore wells.
              (1) Each sweetening unit that processes natural gas is an affected facility; and
              (2) Each sweetening unit that processes natural gas followed by a sulfur recovery unit is an affected facility.

              (3) Facilities that have a design capacity less than 2 long tons per day (LT/D) of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the acid gas (expressed as sulfur) are required to comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in § 60.5423(c) but are not required to comply with §§ 60.5405 through 60.5407 and §§ 60.5410(g) and 60.5415(g) of this subpart.

Check the instrument using the same calibration gas(es) that were used to calibrate the instrument before use. Follow the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 of this part, Section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to the calibration gas value. Record the instrument reading for each scale used as specified in § 60.486a(e)(8). Divide these readings by the initial calibration values for each scale and multiply by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage. If any calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then all equipment monitored since the last calibration with instrument readings below the appropriate leak definition and above the leak definition multiplied by (100 minus the percent of negative drift/divided by 100) must be re-monitored. If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at the owner/operator's discretion, all equipment since the last calibration with instrument readings above the appropriate leak definition and below the leak definition multiplied by (100 plus the percent of positive drift/divided by 100) may be re-monitored.

              (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in VOC emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in VOC emissions achieved under any design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, the Administrator will publish, in the Federal Register, a notice permitting the use of that alternative means for the purpose of compliance with that standard. The notice may condition permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
              (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section must be published only after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.
              (c) The Administrator will consider applications under this section from either owners or operators of affected facilities, or manufacturers of control equipment.
              (d) The Administrator will treat applications under this section according to the following criteria, except in cases where the Administrator concludes that other criteria are appropriate:
              (1) The applicant must collect, verify and submit test data, covering a period of at least 12 months, necessary to support the finding in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (2) If the applicant is an owner or operator of an affected facility, the applicant must commit in writing to operate and maintain the alternative means so as to achieve a reduction in VOC emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in VOC emissions achieved under the design, equipment, work practice or operational standard.
            
            
              § 60.5405
              What standards apply to sweetening units at onshore natural gas processing plants?

              (a) During the initial performance test required by § 60.8(b), you must achieve at a minimum, an SO2 emission reduction efficiency (Zi) to be determined from Table 1 of this subpart based on the sulfur feed rate (X) and the sulfur content of the acid gas (Y) of the affected facility.

              (b) After demonstrating compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, you must achieve at a minimum, an SO2 emission reduction efficiency (Zc) to be determined from Table 2 of this subpart based on the sulfur feed rate (X) and the sulfur content of the acid gas (Y) of the affected facility.
            
            
              § 60.5406
              What test methods and procedures must I use for my sweetening units affected facilities at onshore natural gas processing plants?
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, you must use the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in paragraph § 60.8(b).

              (b) During a performance test required by § 60.8, you must determine the minimum required reduction efficiencies (Z) of SO2 emissions as required in § 60.5405(a) and (b) as follows:
              (1) The average sulfur feed rate (X) must be computed as follows:
              
                ER16AU12.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                X = average sulfur feed rate, Mg/D (LT/D).
                Qa = average volumetric flow rate of acid gas from sweetening unit, dscm/day (dscf/day).
                
                Y = average H2S concentration in acid gas feed from sweetening unit, percent by volume, expressed as a decimal.
                K = (32 kg S/kg-mole)/((24.04 dscm/kg-mole)(1000 kg S/Mg)).
                 = 1.331 × 10−3Mg/dscm, for metric units.
                 = (32 lb S/lb-mole)/((385.36 dscf/lb-mole)(2240 lb S/long ton)).
                 = 3.707 × 10−5 long ton/dscf, for English units.
              
              

              (2) You must use the continuous readings from the process flowmeter to determine the average volumetric flow rate (Qa) in dscm/day (dscf/day) of the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each run.

              (3) You must use the Tutwiler procedure in § 60.5408 or a chromatographic procedure following ASTM E260-96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17) to determine the H2S concentration in the acid gas feed from the sweetening unit (Y). At least one sample per hour (at equally spaced intervals) must be taken during each 4-hour run. The arithmetic mean of all samples must be the average H2S concentration (Y) on a dry basis for the run. By multiplying the result from the Tutwiler procedure by 1.62 × 10−3, the units gr/100 scf are converted to volume percent.

              (4) Using the information from paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section, Tables 1 and 2 of this subpart must be used to determine the required initial (Zi) and continuous (Zc) reduction efficiencies of SO2 emissions.
              (c) You must determine compliance with the SO2 standards in § 60.5405(a) or (b) as follows:
              (1) You must compute the emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur recovery technology for each run using the following equation:
              
                ER16AU12.001
              
              (2) You must use the level indicators or manual soundings to measure the liquid sulfur accumulation rate in the product storage vessels. You must use readings taken at the beginning and end of each run, the tank geometry, sulfur density at the storage temperature, and sample duration to determine the sulfur production rate (S) in kg/hr (lb/hr) for each run.
              (3) You must compute the emission rate of sulfur for each run as follows:
              
                ER16AU12.002
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = emission rate of sulfur per run, kg/hr.
                Ce = concentration of sulfur equivalent (SO2+ reduced sulfur), g/dscm (lb/dscf).
                Qsd = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
                K1 = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (7000 gr/lb).
              
              
              (4) The concentration (Ce) of sulfur equivalent must be the sum of the SO2 and TRS concentrations, after being converted to sulfur equivalents. For each run and each of the test methods specified in this paragraph (c) of this section, you must use a sampling time of at least 4 hours. You must use Method 1 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to select the sampling site. The sampling point in the duct must be at the centroid of the cross-section if the area is less than 5 m2 (54 ft2) or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m (39 in) if the cross-sectional area is 5 m2 or more, and the centroid is more than 1 m (39 in.) from the wall.
              

              (i) You must use Method 6 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to determine the SO2 concentration. You must take eight samples of 20 minutes each at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average must be the concentration for the run. The concentration must be multiplied by 0.5 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.

              (ii) You must use Method 15 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to determine the TRS concentration from reduction-type devices or where the oxygen content of the effluent gas is less than 1.0 percent by volume. The sampling rate must be at least 3 liters/min (0.1 ft3/min) to insure minimum residence time in the sample line. You must take sixteen samples at 15-minute intervals. The arithmetic average of all the samples must be the concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm reduced sulfur as sulfur must be multiplied by 1.333 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.

              (iii) You must use Method 16A or Method 15 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter or ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, Part 10 (manual portion only) (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17) to determine the reduced sulfur concentration from oxidation-type devices or where the oxygen content of the effluent gas is greater than 1.0 percent by volume. You must take eight samples of 20 minutes each at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average must be the concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm reduced sulfur as sulfur must be multiplied by 1.333 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.

              (iv) You must use Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to determine the volumetric flow rate of the effluent gas. A velocity traverse must be conducted at the beginning and end of each run. The arithmetic average of the two measurements must be used to calculate the volumetric flow rate (Qsd) for the run. For the determination of the effluent gas molecular weight, a single integrated sample over the 4-hour period may be taken and analyzed or grab samples at 1-hour intervals may be taken, analyzed, and averaged. For the moisture content, you must take two samples of at least 0.10 dscm (3.5 dscf) and 10 minutes at the beginning of the 4-hour run and near the end of the time period. The arithmetic average of the two runs must be the moisture content for the run.
            
            
              § 60.5407
              What are the requirements for monitoring of emissions and operations from my sweetening unit affected facilities at onshore natural gas processing plants?
              (a) If your sweetening unit affected facility is located at an onshore natural gas processing plant and is subject to the provisions of § 60.5405(a) or (b) you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices or perform measurements to determine the following operations information on a daily basis:
              (1) The accumulation of sulfur product over each 24-hour period. The monitoring method may incorporate the use of an instrument to measure and record the liquid sulfur production rate, or may be a procedure for measuring and recording the sulfur liquid levels in the storage vessels with a level indicator or by manual soundings, with subsequent calculation of the sulfur production rate based on the tank geometry, stored sulfur density, and elapsed time between readings. The method must be designed to be accurate within ±2 percent of the 24-hour sulfur accumulation.
              (2) The H2S concentration in the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each 24-hour period. At least one sample per 24-hour period must be collected and analyzed using the equation specified in § 60.5406(b)(1). The Administrator may require you to demonstrate that the H2S concentration obtained from one or more samples over a 24-hour period is within ±20 percent of the average of 12 samples collected at equally spaced intervals during the 24-hour period. In instances where the H2S concentration of a single sample is not within ±20 percent of the average of the 12 equally spaced samples, the Administrator may require a more frequent sampling schedule.
              (3) The average acid gas flow rate from the sweetening unit. You must install and operate a monitoring device to continuously measure the flow rate of acid gas. The monitoring device reading must be recorded at least once per hour during each 24-hour period. The average acid gas flow rate must be computed from the individual readings.
              (4) The sulfur feed rate (X). For each 24-hour period, you must compute X using the equation specified in § 60.5406(b)(1).
              (5) The required sulfur dioxide emission reduction efficiency for the 24-hour period. You must use the sulfur feed rate and the H2S concentration in the acid gas for the 24-hour period, as applicable, to determine the required reduction efficiency in accordance with the provisions of § 60.5405(b).
              (b) Where compliance is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration device, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices and continuous emission monitors as follows:
              (1) A continuous monitoring system to measure the total sulfur emission rate (E) of SO
                2
                in the gases discharged to the atmosphere. The SO2 emission rate must be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system must be set so that the equivalent emission limit of § 60.5405(b) will be between 30 percent and 70 percent of the measurement range of the instrument system.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section: A monitoring device to measure the temperature of the gas leaving the combustion zone of the incinerator, if compliance with § 60.5405(a) is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration device. The monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±1 percent of the temperature being measured.

              (3) When performance tests are conducted under the provision of § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with the standards under § 60.5405, the temperature of the gas leaving the incinerator combustion zone must be determined using the monitoring device. If the volumetric ratio of sulfur dioxide to sulfur dioxide plus total reduced sulfur (expressed as SO2) in the gas leaving the incinerator is equal to or less than 0.98, then temperature monitoring may be used to demonstrate that sulfur dioxide emission monitoring is sufficient to determine total sulfur emissions. At all times during the operation of the facility, you must maintain the average temperature of the gas leaving the combustion zone of the incinerator at or above the appropriate level determined during the most recent performance test to ensure the sulfur compound oxidation criteria are met. Operation at lower average temperatures may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. You may request that the minimum incinerator temperature be reestablished by conducting new performance tests under § 60.8.
              (4) Upon promulgation of a performance specification of continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery plants, you may, as an alternative to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system for total reduced sulfur compounds as required in paragraph (d) of this section in addition to a sulfur dioxide emission monitoring system. The sum of the equivalent sulfur mass emission rates from the two monitoring systems must be used to compute the total sulfur emission rate (E).

              (c) Where compliance is achieved through the use of a reduction control system not followed by a continually operated incineration device, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system to measure the emission rate of reduced sulfur compounds as SO2 equivalent in the gases discharged to the atmosphere. The SO2 equivalent compound emission rate must be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system must be set so that the equivalent emission limit of § 60.5405(b) will be between 30 and 70 percent of the measurement range of the system. This requirement becomes effective upon promulgation of a performance specification for continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery plants.
              
              (d) For those sources required to comply with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, you must calculate the average sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved (R) for each 24-hour clock interval. The 24-hour interval may begin and end at any selected clock time, but must be consistent. You must compute the 24-hour average reduction efficiency (R) based on the 24-hour average sulfur production rate (S) and sulfur emission rate (E), using the equation in § 60.5406(c)(1).
              (1) You must use data obtained from the sulfur production rate monitoring device specified in paragraph (a) of this section to determine S.
              (2) You must use data obtained from the sulfur emission rate monitoring systems specified in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section to calculate a 24-hour average for the sulfur emission rate (E). The monitoring system must provide at least one data point in each successive 15-minute interval. You must use at least two data points to calculate each 1-hour average. You must use a minimum of 18 1-hour averages to compute each 24-hour average.

              (e) In lieu of complying with paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, those sources with a design capacity of less than 152 Mg/D (150 LT/D) of H2S expressed as sulfur may calculate the sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved for each 24-hour period by:
              
                ER16AU12.003
              
              
                Where:
                
                R = The sulfur dioxide removal efficiency achieved during the 24-hour period, percent.
                K2 = Conversion factor, 0.02400 Mg/D per kg/hr (0.01071 LT/D per lb/hr).
                S = The sulfur production rate during the 24-hour period, kg/hr (lb/hr).
                X = The sulfur feed rate in the acid gas, Mg/D (LT/D).
              
              
              (f) The monitoring devices required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3) and (c) of this section must be calibrated at least annually according to the manufacturer's specifications, as required by § 60.13(b).
              (g) The continuous emission monitoring systems required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (c) of this section must be subject to the emission monitoring requirements of § 60.13 of the General Provisions. For conducting the continuous emission monitoring system performance evaluation required by § 60.13(c), Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter must apply, and Method 6 must be used for systems required by paragraph (b) of this section.
            
            
              § 60.5408
              What is an optional procedure for measuring hydrogen sulfide in acid gas—Tutwiler Procedure?
              The Tutwiler procedure may be found in the Gas Engineers Handbook, Fuel Gas Engineering practices, The Industrial Press, 93 Worth Street, New York, NY, 1966, First Edition, Second Printing, page 6/25 (Docket A-80-20-A, Entry II-I-67).
              (a) When an instantaneous sample is desired and H2S concentration is ten grains per 1000 cubic foot or more, a 100 ml Tutwiler burette is used. For concentrations less than ten grains, a 500 ml Tutwiler burette and more dilute solutions are used. In principle, this method consists of titrating hydrogen sulfide in a gas sample directly with a standard solution of iodine.
              (b) Apparatus. (See Figure 1 of this subpart) A 100 or 500 ml capacity Tutwiler burette, with two-way glass stopcock at bottom and three-way stopcock at top which connect either with inlet tubulature or glass-stoppered cylinder, 10 ml capacity, graduated in 0.1 ml subdivision; rubber tubing connecting burette with leveling bottle.
              (c) Reagents. (1) Iodine stock solution, 0.1N. Weight 12.7 g iodine, and 20 to 25 g cp potassium iodide for each liter of solution. Dissolve KI in as little water as necessary; dissolve iodine in concentrated KI solution, make up to proper volume, and store in glass-stoppered brown glass bottle.

              (2) Standard iodine solution, 1 ml = 0.001771 g I. Transfer 33.7 ml of above 0.1N stock solution into a 250 ml volumetric flask; add water to mark and mix well. Then, for 100 ml sample of gas, 1 ml of standard iodine solution is equivalent to 100 grains H2S per cubic feet of gas.
              (3) Starch solution. Rub into a thin paste about one teaspoonful of wheat starch with a little water; pour into about a pint of boiling water; stir; let cool and decant off clear solution. Make fresh solution every few days.
              (d) Procedure. Fill leveling bulb with starch solution. Raise (L), open cock (G), open (F) to (A), and close (F) when solutions starts to run out of gas inlet. Close (G). Purge gas sampling line and connect with (A). Lower (L) and open (F) and (G). When liquid level is several ml past the 100 ml mark, close (G) and (F), and disconnect sampling tube. Open (G) and bring starch solution to 100 ml mark by raising (L); then close (G). Open (F) momentarily, to bring gas in burette to atmospheric pressure, and close (F). Open (G), bring liquid level down to 10 ml mark by lowering (L). Close (G), clamp rubber tubing near (E) and disconnect it from burette. Rinse graduated cylinder with a standard iodine solution (0.00171 g I per ml); fill cylinder and record reading. Introduce successive small amounts of iodine thru (F); shake well after each addition; continue until a faint permanent blue color is obtained. Record reading; subtract from previous reading, and call difference D.

              (e) With every fresh stock of starch solution perform a blank test as follows: Introduce fresh starch solution into burette up to 100 ml mark. Close (F) and (G). Lower (L) and open (G). When liquid level reaches the 10 ml mark, close (G). With air in burette, titrate as during a test and up to same end point. Call ml of iodine used C. Then, Grains H2S per 100 cubic foot of gas = 100(D-C)

              (f) Greater sensitivity can be attained if a 500 ml capacity Tutwiler burette is used with a more dilute (0.001N) iodine solution. Concentrations less than 1.0 grains per 100 cubic foot can be determined in this way. Usually, the starch-iodine end point is much less distinct, and a blank determination of end point, with H2S-free gas or air, is required.

When performance testing of a combustion control device is conducted by the device manufacturer as specified in § 60.5413(d), compliance with the operating parameter limit is achieved when the criteria in § 60.5413(e) are met.
              (iv) You must operate the continuous monitoring system required in § 60.5417 at all times the affected source is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments). A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
              (v) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use all the data collected during all other required data collection periods to assess the operation of the control device and associated control system.
              (vi) Failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required quality monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments).
              (vii) If you use a combustion control device to meet the requirements of § 60.5412(a) and you demonstrate compliance using the test procedures specified in § 60.5413(b), you must comply with paragraphs (b)(2)(vii)(A) through (D) of this section.

              (5) You may choose to adjust or not adjust the detection instrument readings to account for the background organic concentration level. If you choose to adjust the instrument readings for the background level, you must determine the background level value according to the procedures in Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.

              (6) Your detection instrument must meet the performance criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, the detection instrument must meet the performance criteria of Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, except the instrument response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 must be for the average composition of the process fluid, not each individual volatile organic compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts that are not organic hazardous air pollutants or volatile organic compounds, you must calculate the average stream response factor on an inert-free basis.
              (ii) If no instrument is available that will meet the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, you may adjust the instrument readings by multiplying by the average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-free basis, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.

              § 60.5360a
              What is the purpose of this subpart?

              (a) This subpart establishes emission standards and compliance schedules for the control of the pollutant greenhouse gases (GHG). The greenhouse gas standard in this subpart is in the form of a limitation on emissions of methane from affected facilities in the crude oil and natural gas source category that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 18, 2015. This subpart also establishes emission standards and compliance schedules for the control of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from affected facilities in the crude oil and natural gas source category that commence construction, modification or reconstruction after September 18, 2015. The effective date of the rule is August 2, 2016.
              (b) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and title V thresholds for Greenhouse Gases. (1) For the purposes of 40 CFR 51.166(b)(49)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(48) and in any State Implementation Plan (SIP) approved by the EPA that is interpreted to incorporate, or specifically incorporates, § 51.166(b)(48).

              (2) For the purposes of 40 CFR 52.21(b)(50)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act as defined in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(49).
              
              (3) For the purposes of 40 CFR 70.2, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.
              (4) For the purposes of 40 CFR 71.2, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 71.2.
            
            
              § 60.5365a
              Am I subject to this subpart?
              You are subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart if you are the owner or operator of one or more of the onshore affected facilities listed in paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section for which you commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 18, 2015.
              (a) Each well affected facility, which is a single well that conducts a well completion operation following hydraulic fracturing or refracturing. The provisions of this paragraph do not affect the affected facility status of well sites for the purposes of § 60.5397a. The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section apply to wells that are hydraulically refractured:
              (1) A well that conducts a well completion operation following hydraulic refracturing is not an affected facility, provided that the requirements of § 60.5375a(a)(1) through (4) are met. However, hydraulic refracturing of a well constitutes a modification of the well site for purposes of paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section, regardless of affected facility status of the well itself.
              (2) A well completion operation following hydraulic refracturing not conducted pursuant to § 60.5375a(a)(1) through (4) is a modification to the well.
              (3) Except as provided in § 60.5365a(i)(3)(iii), refracturing of a well, by itself, does not affect the modification status of other equipment, process units, storage vessels, compressors, pneumatic pumps, or pneumatic controllers.
              (4) A well initially constructed after September 18, 2015, that conducts a well completion operation following hydraulic refracturing is considered an affected facility regardless of this provision.
              (b) Each centrifugal compressor affected facility, which is a single centrifugal compressor using wet seals. A centrifugal compressor located at a well site, or an adjacent well site and servicing more than one well site, is not an affected facility under this subpart.
              (c) Each reciprocating compressor affected facility, which is a single reciprocating compressor. A reciprocating compressor located at a well site, or an adjacent well site and servicing more than one well site, is not an affected facility under this subpart.
              (d) Each pneumatic controller affected facility:
              (1) Each pneumatic controller affected facility not located at a natural gas processing plant, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller operating at a natural gas bleed rate greater than 6 scfh.
              (2) Each pneumatic controller affected facility located at a natural gas processing plant, which is a single continuous bleed natural gas-driven pneumatic controller.
              (e) Each storage vessel affected facility, which is a single storage vessel with the potential for VOC emissions equal to or greater than 6 tpy as determined according to this section. The potential for VOC emissions must be calculated using a generally accepted model or calculation methodology, based on the maximum average daily throughput determined for a 30-day period of production prior to the applicable emission determination deadline specified in this subsection. The determination may take into account requirements under a legally and practically enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under a federal, state, local or tribal authority.

              (1) For each new, modified or reconstructed storage vessel you must determine the potential for VOC emissions within 30 days after liquids first enter the storage vessel, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section. For each new, modified or reconstructed storage vessel receiving liquids pursuant to the standards for well affected facilities in § 60.5375a, including wells subject to § 60.5375a(f), you must determine the potential for VOC emissions within 30 days after startup of production of the well.
              (2) A storage vessel affected facility that subsequently has its potential for VOC emissions decrease to less than 6 tpy shall remain an affected facility under this subpart.
              (3) For storage vessels not subject to a legally and practically enforceable limit in an operating permit or other requirement established under federal, state, local or tribal authority, any vapor from the storage vessel that is recovered and routed to a process through a VRU designed and operated as specified in this section is not required to be included in the determination of VOC potential to emit for purposes of determining affected facility status, provided you comply with the requirements in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) You meet the cover requirements specified in § 60.5411a(b).
              (ii) You meet the closed vent system requirements specified in § 60.5411a(c) and (d).
              (iii) You must maintain records that document compliance with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (iv) In the event of removal of apparatus that recovers and routes vapor to a process, or operation that is inconsistent with the conditions specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, you must determine the storage vessel's potential for VOC emissions according to this section within 30 days of such removal or operation.
              (4) The following requirements apply immediately upon startup, startup of production, or return to service. A storage vessel affected facility that is reconnected to the original source of liquids is a storage vessel affected facility subject to the same requirements that applied before being removed from service. Any storage vessel that is used to replace any storage vessel affected facility is subject to the same requirements that apply to the storage vessel affected facility being replaced.
              (5) A storage vessel with a capacity greater than 100,000 gallons used to recycle water that has been passed through two stage separation is not a storage vessel affected facility.
              (f) The group of all equipment within a process unit is an affected facility. (1) Addition or replacement of equipment for the purpose of process improvement that is accomplished without a capital expenditure shall not by itself be considered a modification under this subpart.
              (2) Equipment associated with a compressor station, dehydration unit, sweetening unit, underground storage vessel, field gas gathering system, or liquefied natural gas unit is covered by §§ 60.5400a, 60.5401a, 60.5402a, 60.5421a, and 60.5422a if it is located at an onshore natural gas processing plant. Equipment not located at the onshore natural gas processing plant site is exempt from the provisions of §§ 60.5400a, 60.5401a, 60.5402a, 60.5421a, and 60.5422a.
              (3) The equipment within a process unit of an affected facility located at onshore natural gas processing plants and described in paragraph (f) of this section are exempt from this subpart if they are subject to and controlled according to subparts VVa, GGG, or GGGa of this part.
              (g) Sweetening units located at onshore natural gas processing plants that process natural gas produced from either onshore or offshore wells.
              (1) Each sweetening unit that processes natural gas is an affected facility; and
              (2) Each sweetening unit that processes natural gas followed by a sulfur recovery unit is an affected facility.

              (3) Facilities that have a design capacity less than 2 long tons per day (LT/D) of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the acid gas (expressed as sulfur) are required to comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements specified in § 60.5423a(c) but are not required to comply with §§ 60.5405a through 60.5407a and §§ 60.5410a(g) and 60.5415a(g).

              (4) Sweetening facilities producing acid gas that is completely re-injected into oil-or-gas-bearing geologic strata or that is otherwise not released to the atmosphere are not subject to §§ 60.5405a through 60.5407a, 60.5410a(g), 60.5415a(g), and 60.5423a.
              (h) Each pneumatic pump affected facility:
              (1) For natural gas processing plants, each pneumatic pump affected facility, which is a single natural gas-driven diaphragm pump.
              (2) For well sites, each pneumatic pump affected facility, which is a single natural gas-driven diaphragm pump. A single natural gas-driven diaphragm pump that is in operation less than 90 days per calendar year is not an affected facility under this subpart provided the owner/operator keeps records of the days of operation each calendar year and submits such records to the EPA Administrator (or delegated enforcement authority) upon request. For the purposes of this section, any period of operation during a calendar day counts toward the 90 calendar day threshold.
              (i) Except as provided in § 60.5365a(i)(2), the collection of fugitive emissions components at a well site, as defined in § 60.5430a, is an affected facility.
              (1) [Reserved]
              (2) A well site that only contains one or more wellheads is not an affected facility under this subpart. The affected facility status of a separate tank battery surface site has no effect on the affected facility status of a well site that only contains one or more wellheads.
              (3) For purposes of § 60.5397a, a “modification” to a well site occurs when:
              (i) A new well is drilled at an existing well site;
              (ii) A well at an existing well site is hydraulically fractured; or
              (iii) A well at an existing well site is hydraulically refractured.
              (j) The collection of fugitive emissions components at a compressor station, as defined in § 60.5430a, is an affected facility. For purposes of § 60.5397a, a “modification” to a compressor station occurs when:
              (1) An additional compressor is installed at a compressor station; or
              (2) One or more compressors at a compressor station is replaced by one or more compressors of greater total horsepower than the compressor(s) being replaced. When one or more compressors is replaced by one or more compressors of an equal or smaller total horsepower than the compressor(s) being replaced, installation of the replacement compressor(s) does not trigger a modification of the compressor station for purposes of § 60.5397a.
            
            
              § 60.5370a
              When must I comply with this subpart?
              (a) You must be in compliance with the standards of this subpart no later than August 2, 2016 or upon startup, whichever is later.
              (b) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, owners and operators shall maintain and operate any affected facility including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, opacity observations, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the source. The provisions for exemption from compliance during periods of startup, shutdown and malfunctions provided for in 40 CFR 60.8(c) do not apply to this subpart.
              (c) You are exempt from the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, provided you are not otherwise required by law to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with the provisions of this subpart.

              § 60.5400a
              What equipment leak GHG and VOC standards apply to affected facilities at an onshore natural gas processing plant?
              This section applies to the group of all equipment, except compressors, within a process unit.
              (a) You must comply with the requirements of §§ 60.482-1a(a), (b), and (d), 60.482-2a, and 60.482-4a through 60.482-11a, except as provided in § 60.5401a.
              (b) You may elect to comply with the requirements of §§ 60.483-1a and 60.483-2a, as an alternative.

              (f) You must use the following provision instead of § 60.485a(d)(1): Each piece of equipment is presumed to be in VOC service or in wet gas service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in VOC service or in wet gas service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in VOC service, it must be determined that the VOC content can be reasonably expected never to exceed 10.0 percent by weight. For a piece of equipment to be considered in wet gas service, it must be determined that it contains or contacts the field gas before the extraction step in the process. For purposes of determining the percent VOC content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a piece of equipment, procedures that conform to the methods described in ASTM E169-93, E168-92, or E260-96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17) must be used.

              (2) If an instrument reading of 500 ppm or greater is measured, a leak is detected.
              (3)(i) When a leak is detected, it must be repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in § 60.482-9a.
              (ii) A first attempt at repair must be made no later than 5 calendar days after each leak is detected.
              (4)(i) Any pressure relief device that is located in a nonfractionating plant that is monitored only by non-plant personnel may be monitored after a pressure release the next time the monitoring personnel are onsite, instead of within 5 days as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and § 60.482-4a(b)(1).
              (ii) No pressure relief device described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may be allowed to operate for more than 30 days after a pressure release without monitoring.
              (c) Sampling connection systems are exempt from the requirements of § 60.482-5a.
              (d) Pumps in light liquid service, valves in gas/vapor and light liquid service, pressure relief devices in gas/vapor service, and connectors in gas/vapor service and in light liquid service that are located at a nonfractionating plant that does not have the design capacity to process 283,200 standard cubic meters per day (scmd) (10 million standard cubic feet per day) or more of field gas are exempt from the routine monitoring requirements of §§ 60.482-2a(a)(1), 60.482-7a(a), 60.482-11a(a), and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
              (e) Pumps in light liquid service, valves in gas/vapor and light liquid service, pressure relief devices in gas/vapor service, and connectors in gas/vapor service and in light liquid service within a process unit that is located in the Alaskan North Slope are exempt from the routine monitoring requirements of §§ 60.482-2a(a)(1), 60.482-7a(a), 60.482-11a(a), and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
              (f) An owner or operator may use the following provisions instead of § 60.485a(e):
              (1) Equipment is in heavy liquid service if the weight percent evaporated is 10 percent or less at 150 °Celsius (302 °Fahrenheit) as determined by ASTM Method D86-96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17).
              (2) Equipment is in light liquid service if the weight percent evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 °Celsius (302 °Fahrenheit) as determined by ASTM Method D86-96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17).

              (g) An owner or operator may use the following provisions instead of § 60.485a(b)(2): A calibration drift assessment shall be performed, at a minimum, at the end of each monitoring day. Check the instrument using the same calibration gas(es) that were used to calibrate the instrument before use. Follow the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 of this part, Section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to the calibration gas value. Record the instrument reading for each scale used as specified in § 60.486a(e)(8). Divide these readings by the initial calibration values for each scale and multiply by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage. If any calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then all equipment monitored since the last calibration with instrument readings below the appropriate leak definition and above the leak definition multiplied by (100 minus the percent of negative drift/divided by 100) must be re-monitored. If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at the owner/operator's discretion, all equipment since the last calibration with instrument readings above the appropriate leak definition and below the leak definition multiplied by (100 plus the percent of positive drift/divided by 100) may be re-monitored.
            
            
              § 60.5402a
              What are the alternative means of emission limitations for GHG and VOC equipment leaks from onshore natural gas processing plants?

              (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in GHG and VOC emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in GHG and VOC emissions achieved under any design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, the Administrator will publish, in the Federal Register, a notice permitting the use of that alternative means for the purpose of compliance with that standard.

              § 60.5405a
              What standards apply to sweetening unit affected facilities at onshore natural gas processing plants?

              (a) During the initial performance test required by § 60.8(b), you must achieve at a minimum, an SO2 emission reduction efficiency (Zi) to be determined from Table 1 of this subpart based on the sulfur feed rate (X) and the sulfur content of the acid gas (Y) of the affected facility.

              (b) After demonstrating compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, you must achieve at a minimum, an SO2 emission reduction efficiency (Zc) to be determined from Table 2 of this subpart based on the sulfur feed rate (X) and the sulfur content of the acid gas (Y) of the affected facility.
            
            
              
              § 60.5406a
              What test methods and procedures must I use for my sweetening unit affected facilities at onshore natural gas processing plants?
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, you must use the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).

              (b) During a performance test required by § 60.8, you must determine the minimum required reduction efficiencies (Z) of SO2 emissions as required in § 60.5405a(a) and (b) as follows:

              (1) The average sulfur feed rate (X) must be computed as follows:
              
              
                X = KQ
                a
                Y
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                X = average sulfur feed rate, Mg/D (LT/D).
                Qa = average volumetric flow rate of acid gas from sweetening unit, dscm/day (dscf/day).
                Y = average H2S concentration in acid gas feed from sweetening unit, percent by volume, expressed as a decimal.
                K = (32 kg S/kg-mole)/((24.04 dscm/kg-mole)(1000 kg S/Mg)).
                = 1.331 × 10−3Mg/dscm, for metric units.
                = (32 lb S/lb-mole)/((385.36 dscf/lb-mole)(2240 lb S/long ton)).
                = 3.707 × 10−5 long ton/dscf, for English units.
              
              

              (2) You must use the continuous readings from the process flowmeter to determine the average volumetric flow rate (Qa) in dscm/day (dscf/day) of the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each run.

              (3) You must use the Tutwiler procedure in § 60.5408a or a chromatographic procedure following ASTM E260-96 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17) to determine the H2S concentration in the acid gas feed from the sweetening unit (Y). At least one sample per hour (at equally spaced intervals) must be taken during each 4-hour run. The arithmetic mean of all samples must be the average H2S concentration (Y) on a dry basis for the run. By multiplying the result from the Tutwiler procedure by 1.62 × 10−3, the units gr/100 scf are converted to volume percent.

              (4) Using the information from paragraphs (b)(1) and (3) of this section, Tables 1 and 2 of this subpart must be used to determine the required initial (Zi) and continuous (Zc) reduction efficiencies of SO2 emissions.
              (c) You must determine compliance with the SO2 standards in § 60.5405a(a) or (b) as follows:

              (1) You must compute the emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur recovery technology for each run using the following equation:
              
              
                R = (100S)/(S + E)
              
              (2) You must use the level indicators or manual soundings to measure the liquid sulfur accumulation rate in the product storage vessels. You must use readings taken at the beginning and end of each run, the tank geometry, sulfur density at the storage temperature, and sample duration to determine the sulfur production rate (S) in kg/hr (lb/hr) for each run.

              (3) You must compute the emission rate of sulfur for each run as follows:
              
              
                E = C
                e
                Q
                sd/K
                1
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = emission rate of sulfur per run, kg/hr.
                Ce = concentration of sulfur equivalent (SO2+ reduced sulfur), g/dscm (lb/dscf).
                Qsd = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
                K1 = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (7000 gr/lb).
              
              
              (4) The concentration (Ce) of sulfur equivalent must be the sum of the SO2 and TRS concentrations, after being converted to sulfur equivalents. For each run and each of the test methods specified in this paragraph (c) of this section, you must use a sampling time of at least 4 hours. You must use Method 1 of appendix A-1 of this part to select the sampling site. The sampling point in the duct must be at the centroid of the cross-section if the area is less than 5 m2 (54 ft2) or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m (39 in) if the cross-sectional area is 5 m2 or more, and the centroid is more than 1 m (39 in) from the wall.

              (i) You must use Method 6 of appendix A-4 of this part to determine the SO2 concentration. You must take eight samples of 20 minutes each at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average must be the concentration for the run. The concentration must be multiplied by 0.5 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent. In place of Method 6 of appendix A of this part, you may use ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, Part 10 (manual portion only) (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17).

              (ii) You must use Method 15 of appendix A-5 of this part to determine the TRS concentration from reduction-type devices or where the oxygen content of the effluent gas is less than 1.0 percent by volume. The sampling rate must be at least 3 liters/min (0.1 ft3/min) to insure minimum residence time in the sample line. You must take sixteen samples at 15-minute intervals. The arithmetic average of all the samples must be the concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm reduced sulfur as sulfur must be multiplied by 1.333 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.

              (iii) You must use Method 16A of appendix A-6 of this part or Method 15 of appendix A-5 of this part or ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, Part 10 (manual portion only) (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17) to determine the reduced sulfur concentration from oxidation-type devices or where the oxygen content of the effluent gas is greater than 1.0 percent by volume. You must take eight samples of 20 minutes each at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average must be the concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm reduced sulfur as sulfur must be multiplied by 1.333 × 10−3 to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.

              (iv) You must use Method 2 of appendix A-1 of this part to determine the volumetric flow rate of the effluent gas. A velocity traverse must be conducted at the beginning and end of each run. The arithmetic average of the two measurements must be used to calculate the volumetric flow rate (Qsd) for the run. For the determination of the effluent gas molecular weight, a single integrated sample over the 4-hour period may be taken and analyzed or grab samples at 1-hour intervals may be taken, analyzed, and averaged. For the moisture content, you must take two samples of at least 0.10 dscm (3.5 dscf) and 10 minutes at the beginning of the 4-hour run and near the end of the time period. The arithmetic average of the two runs must be the moisture content for the run.
            
            
              § 60.5407a
              What are the requirements for monitoring of emissions and operations from my sweetening unit affected facilities at onshore natural gas processing plants?
              (a) If your sweetening unit affected facility is located at an onshore natural gas processing plant and is subject to the provisions of § 60.5405a(a) or (b) you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices or perform measurements to determine the following operations information on a daily basis:
              (1) The accumulation of sulfur product over each 24-hour period. The monitoring method may incorporate the use of an instrument to measure and record the liquid sulfur production rate, or may be a procedure for measuring and recording the sulfur liquid levels in the storage vessels with a level indicator or by manual soundings, with subsequent calculation of the sulfur production rate based on the tank geometry, stored sulfur density, and elapsed time between readings. The method must be designed to be accurate within ±2 percent of the 24-hour sulfur accumulation.
              (2) The H2S concentration in the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each 24-hour period. At least one sample per 24-hour period must be collected and analyzed using the equation specified in § 60.5406a(b)(1). The Administrator may require you to demonstrate that the H2S concentration obtained from one or more samples over a 24-hour period is within ±20 percent of the average of 12 samples collected at equally spaced intervals during the 24-hour period. In instances where the H2S concentration of a single sample is not within ±20 percent of the average of the 12 equally spaced samples, the Administrator may require a more frequent sampling schedule.
              (3) The average acid gas flow rate from the sweetening unit. You must install and operate a monitoring device to continuously measure the flow rate of acid gas. The monitoring device reading must be recorded at least once per hour during each 24-hour period. The average acid gas flow rate must be computed from the individual readings.

              (4) The sulfur feed rate (X). For each 24-hour period, you must compute X using the equation specified in § 60.5406a(b)(1).

              (5) The required sulfur dioxide emission reduction efficiency for the 24-hour period. You must use the sulfur feed rate and the H2S concentration in the acid gas for the 24-hour period, as applicable, to determine the required reduction efficiency in accordance with the provisions of § 60.5405a(b).
              (b) Where compliance is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration device, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices and continuous emission monitors as follows:

              (1) A continuous monitoring system to measure the total sulfur emission rate (E) of SO2 in the gases discharged to the atmosphere. The SO2 emission rate must be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system must be set so that the equivalent emission limit of § 60.5405a(b) will be between 30 percent and 70 percent of the measurement range of the instrument system.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section: A monitoring device to measure the temperature of the gas leaving the combustion zone of the incinerator, if compliance with § 60.5405a(a) is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration device. The monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±1 percent of the temperature being measured.

              (3) When performance tests are conducted under the provision of § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with the standards under § 60.5405a, the temperature of the gas leaving the incinerator combustion zone must be determined using the monitoring device. If the volumetric ratio of sulfur dioxide to sulfur dioxide plus total reduced sulfur (expressed as SO2) in the gas leaving the incinerator is equal to or less than 0.98, then temperature monitoring may be used to demonstrate that sulfur dioxide emission monitoring is sufficient to determine total sulfur emissions. At all times during the operation of the facility, you must maintain the average temperature of the gas leaving the combustion zone of the incinerator at or above the appropriate level determined during the most recent performance test to ensure the sulfur compound oxidation criteria are met. Operation at lower average temperatures may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. You may request that the minimum incinerator temperature be reestablished by conducting new performance tests under § 60.8.
              (4) Upon promulgation of a performance specification of continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery plants, you may, as an alternative to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system for total reduced sulfur compounds as required in paragraph (d) of this section in addition to a sulfur dioxide emission monitoring system. The sum of the equivalent sulfur mass emission rates from the two monitoring systems must be used to compute the total sulfur emission rate (E).

              (c) Where compliance is achieved through the use of a reduction control system not followed by a continually operated incineration device, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system to measure the emission rate of reduced sulfur compounds as SO2 equivalent in the gases discharged to the atmosphere. The SO2 equivalent compound emission rate must be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system must be set so that the equivalent emission limit of § 60.5405a(b) will be between 30 and 70 percent of the measurement range of the system. This requirement becomes effective upon promulgation of a performance specification for continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery plants.

              (d) For those sources required to comply with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, you must calculate the average sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved (R) for each 24-hour clock interval. The 24-hour interval may begin and end at any selected clock time, but must be consistent. You must compute the 24-hour average reduction efficiency (R) based on the 24-hour average sulfur production rate (S) and sulfur emission rate (E), using the equation in § 60.5406a(c)(1).
              (1) You must use data obtained from the sulfur production rate monitoring device specified in paragraph (a) of this section to determine S.
              (2) You must use data obtained from the sulfur emission rate monitoring systems specified in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section to calculate a 24-hour average for the sulfur emission rate (E). The monitoring system must provide at least one data point in each successive 15-minute interval. You must use at least two data points to calculate each 1-hour average. You must use a minimum of 18 1-hour averages to compute each 24-hour average.

              (e) In lieu of complying with paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, those sources with a design capacity of less than 152 Mg/D (150 LT/D) of H2S expressed as sulfur may calculate the sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved for each 24-hour period by:
              
                ER03JN16.001
              
              
                Where:
                
                R = The sulfur dioxide removal efficiency achieved during the 24-hour period, percent.
                K2 = Conversion factor, 0.02400 Mg/D per kg/hr (0.01071 LT/D per lb/hr).
                S = The sulfur production rate during the 24-hour period, kg/hr (lb/hr).
                X = The sulfur feed rate in the acid gas, Mg/D (LT/D).
              
              
              (f) The monitoring devices required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3) and (c) of this section must be calibrated at least annually according to the manufacturer's specifications, as required by § 60.13(b).
              (g) The continuous emission monitoring systems required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (c) of this section must be subject to the emission monitoring requirements of § 60.13 of the General Provisions. For conducting the continuous emission monitoring system performance evaluation required by § 60.13(c), Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part must apply, and Method 6 of appendix A-4 of this part must be used for systems required by paragraph (b) of this section. In place of Method 6 of appendix A-4 of this part, ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) may be used.
            
            
              § 60.5408a
              What is an optional procedure for measuring hydrogen sulfide in acid gas—Tutwiler Procedure?
              The Tutwiler procedure may be found in the Gas Engineers Handbook, Fuel Gas Engineering practices, The Industrial Press, 93 Worth Street, New York, NY, 1966, First Edition, Second Printing, page 6/25 (Docket A-80-20-A, Entry II-I-67).
              (a) When an instantaneous sample is desired and H2S concentration is 10 grains per 1000 cubic foot or more, a 100 ml Tutwiler burette is used. For concentrations less than 10 grains, a 500 ml Tutwiler burette and more dilute solutions are used. In principle, this method consists of titrating hydrogen sulfide in a gas sample directly with a standard solution of iodine.
              (b) Apparatus. (See Figure 1 of this subpart.) A 100 or 500 ml capacity Tutwiler burette, with two-way glass stopcock at bottom and three-way stopcock at top that connect either with inlet tubulature or glass-stoppered cylinder, 10 ml capacity, graduated in 0.1 ml subdivision; rubber tubing connecting burette with leveling bottle.
              (c) Reagents. (1) Iodine stock solution, 0.1N. Weight 12.7 g iodine, and 20 to 25 g cp potassium iodide (KI) for each liter of solution. Dissolve KI in as little water as necessary; dissolve iodine in concentrated KI solution, make up to proper volume, and store in glass-stoppered brown glass bottle.

              (2) Standard iodine solution, 1 ml=0.001771 g I. Transfer 33.7 ml of above 0.1N stock solution into a 250 ml volumetric flask; add water to mark and mix well. Then, for 100 ml sample of gas, 1 ml of standard iodine solution is equivalent to 100 grains H2S per cubic feet of gas.
              (3) Starch solution. Rub into a thin paste about one teaspoonful of wheat starch with a little water; pour into about a pint of boiling water; stir; let cool and decant off clear solution. Make fresh solution every few days.
              (d) Procedure. Fill leveling bulb with starch solution. Raise (L), open cock (G), open (F) to (A), and close (F) when solutions starts to run out of gas inlet. Close (G). Purge gas sampling line and connect with (A). Lower (L) and open (F) and (G). When liquid level is several ml past the 100 ml mark, close (G) and (F), and disconnect sampling tube. Open (G) and bring starch solution to 100 ml mark by raising (L); then close (G). Open (F) momentarily, to bring gas in burette to atmospheric pressure, and close (F). Open (G), bring liquid level down to 10 ml mark by lowering (L). Close (G), clamp rubber tubing near (E) and disconnect it from burette. Rinse graduated cylinder with a standard iodine solution (0.00171 g I per ml); fill cylinder and record reading. Introduce successive small amounts of iodine through (F); shake well after each addition; continue until a faint permanent blue color is obtained. Record reading; subtract from previous reading, and call difference D.

              (e) With every fresh stock of starch solution perform a blank test as follows: Introduce fresh starch solution into burette up to 100 ml mark. Close (F) and (G). Lower (L) and open (G). When liquid level reaches the 10 ml mark, close (G). With air in burette, titrate as during a test and up to same end point. Call ml of iodine used C. Then,
              
              Grains H2S per 100 cubic foot of gas = 100 (D-C)
              

              (f) Greater sensitivity can be attained if a 500 ml capacity Tutwiler burette is used with a more dilute (0.001N) iodine solution. Concentrations less than 1.0 grains per 100 cubic foot can be determined in this way. Usually, the starch-iodine end point is much less distinct, and a blank determination of end point, with H2S-free gas or air, is required.

              § 60.5475
              What compliance and certification requirements must I meet and by when?
              (a) Certification requirement. (1) Each affected residential hydronic heater, forced-air furnace and other central heater must be certified to be in compliance with the applicable emission standards and other requirements of this subpart. For each model line manufactured or sold by a single entity, e.g., company or manufacturer, compliance with applicable emission standards of § 60.5474 must be determined based on testing of representative affected central heaters within the model line. If one entity licenses a model line to another entity, each entity's model line must be certified. If an entity intends to change the name of the entity or the name of the model, the manufacturer must apply for a new certification 60 days before making the change.
              (2) The manufacturer of each model line must submit the information required in paragraph (b) of this section and follow either the certification process in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section (for forced-air furnaces) or the certification procedure specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (3) Models qualified as meeting the Phase 2 emission levels under the 2011 EPA hydronic heater partnership agreement are automatically deemed to have a certificate of compliance for the 2015 particulate matter emission standards and be valid until the effective date for the 2020 particulate matter emission standards.
              (4) Models certified by the New York State Department of Environment and Conservation to meet the emission levels in § 60.5474(b) are automatically deemed to have a certificate of compliance for the 2015 particulate matter emission standards and be valid until the effective date for the 2020 particulate matter emission standards.

              (5) Models approved by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority under the Renewable Heat New York (RHNY) Biomass Boiler Program are automatically deemed to have a certificate of compliance for the 2015 particulate matter emission standards and be valid until the effective date for the 2020 particulate matter emission standards provided that they comply with the thermal storage requirements in the RHNY program.
              (6) Small forced-air furnace models that are certified under CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), by an EPA approved third-party certifier, to meet the 2016 particulate matter emission level will be automatically deemed to have a certificate of compliance for the 2016 particulate matter emission standards and be valid until the effective date for the 2020 particulate matter emission standards.
              (7) Large forced-air furnace models that are certified under CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), by an EPA approved third-party certifier, to meet the 2017 particulate matter emission level will be automatically deemed to have a certificate of compliance for the 2017 particulate matter emission standards and be valid until the effective date of the 2020 particulate matter emission standards.
              (b) Application for a certificate of compliance. Any manufacturer of an affected residential hydronic heater or forced-air furnace or other central heater must apply to the Administrator for a certificate of compliance for each model line.

              (12) A statement that the manufacturer will place a copy of the certification test report and summary on the manufacturer's Web site available to the public within 30 days after the Administrator issues a certificate of compliance.
              (13) A statement of acknowledgment that the certificate of compliance cannot be transferred to another manufacturer or model line without written approval by the Administrator.
              (14) A statement acknowledging that it is unlawful to sell, distribute, or offer to sell or distribute an affected wood heater without a valid certificate of compliance.
              (15) Contact information for the responsible representative of the manufacturer and all authorized representatives, including name, affiliation, physical address, telephone number and email address.
              (c) Administrator approval process. (1) The Administrator may issue a certificate of compliance for a model line if the Administrator determines, based on all information submitted by the applicant and any other relevant information available, that:
              (i) A valid certification test demonstrates that the representative affected central heater complies with the applicable emission standards in § 60.5474;
              (ii) Any tolerances or materials for components listed in paragraph (k)(2) or (3) of this section that are different from those specified in those paragraphs may not reasonably be anticipated to cause central heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits; and
              (iii) The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section have been met.
              (2) The Administrator will deny certification if the Administrator determines that the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section have not been satisfied. Upon denying certification under this paragraph, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for this determination.
              (d) Level of compliance certification. The Administrator will issue the certificate of compliance for the most stringent particulate matter emission standard that the tested representative central heater meets under § 60.5474.
              (e) Conditional, temporary certificate of compliance. A conditional, temporary certificate of compliance with the Step 1 p.m. emission standards may be granted by the Administrator until May 16, 2016 for small or large forced-air furnaces based on the manufacturer's submittal of a complete certification application meeting all requirements in § 60.5475(b). The application must include the full test report by an EPA-approved laboratory and all required compliance statements by the manufacturer with the exception of a certificate of conformity by an EPA approved third-party certifier. The conditional, temporary approval would allow early marketing of forced-air furnaces as having a conditional, temporary certificate of compliance with the Step 1 p.m. emission standards until May 16, 2016 or until the Administrator completes the review of the application, whichever is earlier.
              (f) Third-party certifier-based application process. (1) Any manufacturer of an affected central heater must apply to the Administrator for a certificate of compliance for each model line. The manufacturer must meet the following requirements:
              (i) The manufacturer must contract with a third-party certifier for certification services. The contract must include regular (at least annual) unannounced audits under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 to ensure that the manufacturer's quality assurance plan is being implemented. The contract must also include a report for each audit under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 that fully documents the results of the audit. The contract must include authorization and requirement for the third-party certifier to submit all such reports to the Administrator and the manufacturer within 30 days of the audit. The audit report must identify deviations from the manufacturer's quality assurance plan and specify the corrective actions that need to be taken to address each identified deficiency.
              (ii) The manufacturer must submit the materials specified in paragraph (b) of this section and a quality assurance plan that meets the requirements of paragraph (m) of this section to the third-party certifier. The quality assurance plan must ensure that units within a model line will be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the wood heater submitted for certification testing, and it must include design drawings for the model line.
              (iii) The manufacturer must apply to the third-party certifier for a certification of conformity with the applicable requirements of this subpart for the model line.
              (A) After testing by an approved test laboratory is complete, certification of conformity with the emission standards in § 60.5474 must be performed by the manufacturer's contracted third-party certifier.
              (B) The third-party certifier may certify conformity if the emission tests have been conducted per the appropriate guidelines: The test report is complete and accurate; the instrumentation used for the test was properly calibrated; the test report shows that the representative affected central heater meets the applicable emission limits specified in § 60.5474; and the quality assurance plan is adequate to ensure that units within the model line will be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the central heater submitted for certification testing, and that the affected heaters would meet all applicable requirements of this subpart.
              (iv) The manufacturer must then submit to the Administrator an application for a certificate of compliance that includes the certification of conformity, quality assurance plan, test report and all supporting documentation specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (v) The submission also must include a statement signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer or authorized representative that the manufacturer has complied with and will continue to comply with all requirements of this subpart for certificate of compliance and that the manufacturer remains responsible for compliance regardless of any error by the test laboratory or third-party certifier.
              (2) The Administrator will issue to the manufacturer a certificate of compliance for a model line if it is determined, based on all of the information submitted in the application for certification and any other relevant information, that:

              (i) A valid certification of conformity has demonstrated that the representative affected central heater complies with the applicable emission standards in § 60.5474;
              (ii) Any tolerances or materials for components listed in paragraph (k)(2) or (3) of this section that are different from those specified in those paragraphs may not be reasonably anticipated to cause central heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits;
              (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (b) of this section have been met; and
              (iv) A valid certificate of conformity for the model line has been prepared and submitted.
              (3) The Administrator will deny certification if the Administrator determines that the criteria in paragraph (f)(2) of this section have not been satisfied. Upon denying certification under this paragraph, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination.
              (g) Waiver from submitting test results. An applicant for certification may apply for a potential waiver of the requirement to submit the results of a certification test pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, if the central heater meets either of the following conditions:
              (1) The central heaters of the model line are similar in all material respects that would affect emissions, as defined in § 60.5473 and paragraph (k) of this section, to another model line that has already been issued a certificate of compliance. A manufacturer that seeks a waiver of certification testing must identify the model line that has been certified, and must submit a copy of an agreement with the owner of the design permitting the applicant to produce central heaters of that design.
              (2) The manufacturer has previously conducted a valid certification test to demonstrate that the central heaters of the model line meet the applicable standard specified in § 60.5474.
              (h) Certification period. Unless revoked sooner by the Administrator, a certificate of compliance will be valid for 5 years from the date of issuance or until a more stringent standard comes into effect, whichever is sooner.
              (i) Renewal of certification. (1) The manufacturer must renew a model line's certificate of compliance or recertify the model line every 5 years, or the manufacturer may choose to no longer manufacture or sell that model line after the expiration date. If the manufacturer chooses to no longer manufacture that model line, then the manufacturer must submit a statement to the Administrator to that effect.
              (2) A manufacturer of an affected residential hydronic heater or forced-air furnace or other central heater may apply to the Administrator for potential renewal of its certificate of compliance by submitting the material specified in paragraph (b) and following the procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section, or by affirming in writing that the central heaters in the model line continue to be similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the representative central heater submitted for testing on which the original certificate of compliance was based and requesting a potential waiver from certification testing. The application must include a copy of the review of the draft application and approval by the third-party certifier.
              (3) If the Administrator grants a renewal of certification, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination and issue a certification renewal.
              (4) If the Administrator denies the request for a renewal of certification, the Administrator will give written notice to the manufacturer setting forth the basis for the determination.
              (5) If the Administrator denies the request for a renewal of certification, the manufacturer and retailer must not manufacture or sell the previously-certified central heaters after the expiration date of the certificate of compliance.
              (j) [Reserved]
              (k) Recertification. (1) The manufacturer must recertify a model line whenever any change is made in the design submitted pursuant to paragraph (k)(2) of this section that affects or is presumed to affect the particulate matter emission rate for that model line. The manufacturer of an affected central heater must apply to the Administrator for potential recertification by submitting the material specified in paragraph (b) of this section and following the procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section or by affirming in writing that the change will not cause the central heaters in the model line to exceed applicable emission limits and requesting a waiver from certification testing. The application for recertification must be reviewed and approved by the contracted third-party certifier and a copy of the review and approval must be included. The Administrator may waive this requirement upon written request by the manufacturer, if the manufacturer presents adequate rationale and the Administrator determines that the change may not reasonably be anticipated to cause central heaters in the model line to exceed the applicable emission limits. The granting of such a waiver does not relieve the manufacturer of any compliance obligations under this subpart.
              (2) Any change in the design tolerances of any of the following components (where such components are applicable) is presumed to affect particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency if that change exceeds ±0.64 cm (±1/4 inch) for any linear dimension and ±5 percent for any cross-sectional area relating to air introduction systems and catalyst bypass gaps unless other dimensions and cross-sectional areas are previously approved by the Administrator under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section:
              (i) Firebox: Dimensions;
              (ii) Air introduction systems: Cross-sectional area of restrictive air inlets and outlets, location and method of control;
              (iii) Baffles: Dimensions and locations;
              (iv) Refractory/insulation: Dimensions and location;
              (v) Catalyst: Dimensions and location;
              (vi) Catalyst bypass mechanism and catalyst bypass gap tolerances (when bypass mechanism is in closed position): Dimensions, cross-sectional area, and location;
              (vii) Flue gas exit: Dimensions and location;
              (viii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets: Dimensions and fit;
              (ix) Outer thermal shielding and thermal coverings: Dimensions and location;
              (x) Fuel feed system: For central heaters that are designed primarily to burn wood pellet fuel or wood chips and other central heaters equipped with a fuel feed system, the fuel feed rate, auger motor design and power rating, and the angle of the auger to the firebox; and
              (xi) Forced air combustion system: For central heaters so equipped, the location and horsepower of blower motors and the fan blade size.
              (3) Any change in the materials used for the following components is presumed to affect particulate matter emissions and efficiency:
              (i) Refractory/insulation; or
              (ii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets.
              (4) A change in the make, model, or composition of a catalyst is presumed to affect particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency, unless the change has been requested by the central heater manufacturer and has been approved in advance by the Administrator, based on test data that demonstrate that the replacement catalyst is equivalent to or better than the original catalyst in terms of particulate matter emission reduction.
              (l) Criteria for revocation of certification. (1) The Administrator may revoke certification of a product line if it is determined that the central heaters being manufactured or sold in that model line do not comply with the requirements of this subpart. Such a determination will be based on all available evidence, including but not limited to:
              (i) Test data from retesting of the original unit on which the certification test was conducted on a unit that is similar in all material respects that would affect emissions;
              (ii) A finding that the certification test was not valid. The finding will be based on problems or irregularities with the certification test or its documentation, but may be supplemented by other information;

              (iii) A finding that the labeling of the central heater model line or the owner's manual or the associated marketing information does not comply with the requirements of § 60.5478;
              
              (iv) Failure by the manufacturer to comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of § 60.5479;
              (v) Physical examination showing that a significant percentage (as defined in the quality assurance plan approved pursuant to paragraph (m) of this section, but no larger than 1 percent) of production units inspected is not similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the representative affected central heater submitted for certification testing; or
              (vi) Failure of the manufacturer to conduct a quality assurance program in conformity with paragraph (m).
              (vii) Failure of the approved laboratory to test the central heater using the methods specified in § 60.5476.
              (2) Revocation of certification under this paragraph (l) of this section will not take effect until the manufacturer concerned has been given written notice by the Administrator setting forth the basis for the proposed determination and an opportunity to request a hearing under § 60.5481.
              (m) Quality assurance program. On or after May 16, 2016, for each certified model line, the manufacturer must conduct a quality assurance program that satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (m)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (1) The manufacturer must prepare and operate according to a quality assurance plan for each certified model line that includes specific inspection and testing requirements for ensuring that all units within a model line are similar in all material respects that would affect emissions to the central heater submitted for certification testing and meet the emissions standards in § 60.5474.
              (2) The quality assurance plan must be approved by the third-party certifier as part of the certification of conformity process specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (3) The quality assurance plan must include regular (at least annual) unannounced audits by the third-party certifier under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 to ensure that the manufacturer's quality assurance plan is being implemented.
              (4) The quality assurance plan must include a report for each audit under ISO-IEC Standard 17065 that fully documents the results of the audit. The third-party certifier must be authorized and required to submit all such reports to the Administrator within 30 days of the audit. The audit report must identify deviations from the manufacturer's quality assurance plan and specify the corrective actions that need to be taken to address each identified deficiency.
              (5) Within 30 days after receiving each audit report, the manufacturer must report to the third-party certifier and to the Administrator its corrective actions and responses to any deficiencies identified in the audit report. No such report is required if an audit report did not identify any deficiencies.
              (n) EPA compliance audit testing. (1)(i) The Administrator may select by written notice central heaters or model lines for compliance audit testing to determine compliance with the emission standards in § 60.5474.
              (ii) The Administrator will transmit a written notification of the selected central heaters or model line(s) to the manufacturer, which will include the name and address of the laboratory selected to perform the audit test and the model name and serial number of the central heater(s) or central heater model line(s) selected to undergo audit testing.
              (2)(i) The Administrator may test, or direct the manufacturer to have tested, the central heater(s) from the model line(s) selected under paragraph (n)(1)(i) of this section in a laboratory approved under § 60.5477. The Administrator may select any approved test laboratory or federal laboratory for this audit testing.
              (ii) The expense of the compliance audit test is the responsibility of the central heater manufacturer.

              (iii) The test must be conducted using the same test method used to obtain certification. If the certification test consisted of more than one particulate matter sampling test method, the Administrator may direct the manufacturer and test laboratory as to which of these methods to use for the purpose of audit testing. The Administrator will notify the manufacturer at least 30 days prior to any test under this paragraph, and allow the manufacturer and/or his authorized representatives to observe the test.
              (3) Revocation of certification. (i) If emissions from a central heater tested under paragraph (n)(2) of this section exceed the applicable emission standard by more than 50 percent using the same test method used to obtain certification, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer that certification for that model line is suspended effective 72 hours from the receipt of the notice, unless the suspension notice is withdrawn by the Administrator. The suspension will remain in effect until withdrawn by the Administrator, or the date 30 days from its effective date if a revocation notice under paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section is not issued within that period, or the date of final agency action on revocation, whichever occurs earliest.
              (ii)(A) If emissions from a central heater tested under paragraph (n)(2) of this section exceed the applicable emission limit, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer that certification is revoked for that model line.
              (B) A notice under paragraph (n)(3)(ii)(A) of this section will become final and effective 60 days after the date of written notification to the manufacturer, unless it is withdrawn, a hearing is requested under § 60.5481(a)(2), or the deadline for requesting a hearing is extended.
              (C) The Administrator may extend the deadline for requesting a hearing for up to 60 days for good cause.
              (D) A manufacturer may extend the deadline for requesting a hearing for up to 6 months, by agreeing to a voluntary suspension of certification.
              (iii) Any notification under paragraph (n)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section will include a copy of a preliminary test report from the approved test laboratory or federal test laboratory. The test laboratory must provide a preliminary test report to the Administrator within 14 days of the completion of testing, if a central heater exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 60.5474. The test laboratory must provide the Administrator and the manufacturer, within 30 days of the completion of testing, all documentation pertaining to the test, including the complete test report and raw data sheets, laboratory technician notes, and test results for all test runs.
              (iv) Upon receiving notification of a test failure under paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer may request that up to four additional central heaters from the same model line be tested at the manufacturer's expense, at the test laboratory that performed the emissions test for the Administrator.
              (v) Whether or not the manufacturer proceeds under paragraph (n)(3)(iv) of this section, the manufacturer may submit any relevant information to the Administrator, including any other test data generated pursuant to this subpart. The manufacturer must bear the expense of any additional testing.
              (vi) The Administrator will withdraw any notice issued under paragraph (n)(3)(ii) of this section if tests under paragraph (n)(3)(iv) of this section show either—
              (A) That exactly four additional central heaters were tested for the manufacturer and all four met the applicable emission limits; or
              (B) That exactly two additional central heaters were tested for the manufacturer and each of them met the applicable emission limits and the average emissions of all three tested heaters (the original audit heater and the two additional heaters) met the applicable emission limits.
              (vii) If the Administrator withdraws a notice pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(vi) of this section, the Administrator will revise the certification values for the model line based on the test data and other relevant information. The manufacturer must then revise the labels and marketing information accordingly.
              (viii) The Administrator may withdraw any proposed revocation, if the Administrator finds that an audit test failure has been rebutted by information submitted by the manufacturer under paragraph (n)(3)(iv) of this section and/or (n)(3)(v) of this section or by any other relevant information available to the Administrator.
            
            
              
              § 60.5476
              What test methods and procedures must I use to determine compliance with the standards and requirements for certification?
              Test methods and procedures specified in this section or in appendices of this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), must be used to determine compliance with the standards and requirements for certification under §§ 60.5474 and 60.5475 and for reporting carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency. The EPA will post all approved alternative test methods on the EPA Web site. The manufacturer or the manufacturer's authorized representative must submit a summary and the full test report with all supporting information, including detailed discussion of all anomalies, whether all burn rate categories were properly achieved, any data not used in the calculations and, for any test runs not completed, the data that were collected and the reason that the test run was not completed. The burn rate for the low burn rate category must be no greater than the rate that an operator can achieve in home use and no greater than is advertised by the manufacturer or retailer.
              (a) Canadian Standards Administration (CSA) Method B415.1-10, sections 13.7-13.10 (IBR, see § 60.17), must be used to measure the thermal efficiency and CO emissions of outdoor and indoor residential hydronic heaters and forced-air furnaces, except that the burn rates specified in Method 28WHH must be used for hydronic heaters.
              (b) Testing conducted with continuously fed biomass as the fuel(s) must be conducted according to the relevant section of the ASTM E2618-13 (IBR, see § 60.17) or adaptations approved by EPA. The EPA will post all approved alternative test methods on the EPA Web site.
              (c)(1) For outdoor and indoor residential hydronic heaters to be tested under the 2015 particulate matter emission standards in § 60.5474(b)(1), the manufacturer must have an EPA-approved test laboratory use:
              (i) Method 28WHH;
              (ii) Method 28WHH PTS;
              (iii) ASTM E2618-13 (IBR, see § 60.17) (using crib wood); or
              (iv) EN 303-5 (IBR, see § 60.17), only for units sold with thermal storage.
              (2) For outdoor and indoor residential hydronic heaters to be tested under the 2020 particulate matter emission standards in § 60.5474(b)(2), the manufacturer must have an EPA-approved test laboratory use:
              (i) Method 28WHH;
              (ii) Method 28WHH PTS; or
              (iii) ASTM E2618-13 (IBR, see § 60.17) (using crib wood).
              (3) If the heater is equipped with full or partial heat storage, the manufacturer, retailer and installer must not sell or install the heater with less heat storage capacity than is used in the certification test.
              (4) The manufacturer and approved laboratory must make the following adjustments to the methods listed in paragraphs (a), (c)(1) and (2) of this section:
              (i) For ASTM E2618-13 (IBR, see § 60.17), the burn rate categories specified in Method 28WHH must be used;
              (ii) For EN 303-5 (IBR, see § 60.17), the organic compounds must be included as part of the PM.
              (iii) For ASTM 2618-13 (IBR, see § 60.17) Appendix A1 for full thermal storage certification tests, the test must use the large scale as required in the test method unless the manufacturer requests a variance, in advance of testing, contingent upon measuring flue gas temperature, oxygen and CO, using a simple electronic spreadsheet calculator to estimate efficiency and conducting a comparison to the delivered efficiency to determine if a more detailed examination should be made.
              (5) For particulate matter emission concentrations measured with ASTM E2515-11 (IBR, see § 60.17), four-inch filters and Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used.

              (6) For all tests conducted using ASTM 2515-11 (IBR, see § 60.17) pursuant to this section, the manufacturer and approved test laboratory must also measure the first hour of particulate matter emissions for each test run using a separate filter in one of the two parallel trains. The manufacturer and approved test laboratory must report the test results for the first hour separately and also include them in the total particulate matter emissions per run.
              (d)(1) For hydronic heaters subject to the 2020 cord wood alternative compliance option specified in § 60.5474(b)(3), the manufacturers must have the approved laboratory conduct cord wood testing using the test methods listed below:
              (i) Method 28WHH;
              (ii) Method 28WHH PTS; or
              (iii) ASTM E2618-13 (IBR, see § 60.17) (using cord wood).
              (2) If the heater is equipped with full or partial heat storage, the manufacturer, retailer and installer must not sell or install the heater with less heat storage capacity than is used in the certification test.
              (3) The manufacturer and approved laboratory must make the following adjustments to the methods listed in (d)(1) of this section:
              (i) For ASTM E2618-13 (IBR, see § 60.17), use the burn rate categories specified in Method 28WHH;
              (ii) For all methods, report the results separately per burn rate category.
              (e) For forced-air furnaces, use CSA Method B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) to measure the heat output (mmBtu/hr) and particulate matter emission rate (lb/mmBtu heat output), except use the burn rate categories in Method 28WHH for the 2020 particulate matter emission standards. For the 2020 particulate matter emission standards, report the particulate matter, efficiency and CO emission results separately per burn rate category.
              (f) For affected wood heaters subject to the particulate matter emission standards, emission concentrations must be measured with ASTM E2515-11 (IBR, see § 60.17), except for the 2015 certification tests using EN303-5 (IBR, see § 60.17). As required in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer and approved laboratory must add the organic gases to the PM for EN 303-5. Four-inch filters and Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used in ASTM E2515-11. Method 5H is not allowed for certification testing.
              (g) Douglas fir may be used in ASTM E2618-13 and CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17).

              (h) The manufacturer of an affected central heater model line must notify the Administrator of the date that certification testing is to begin, by email, to WoodHeaterReports@epa.gov. This notice must be at least 30 days before the start of testing. The notification of testing must include the manufacturer's name and physical and email addresses, the approved test laboratory's name and physical and email addresses, third-party certifier name, the model name and number (or, if unavailable, some other way to distinguish between models), and the dates of testing. The laboratory may substitute certification testing of another affected central heater on the original date in order to ensure regular laboratory testing operations.
              (i) The approved test laboratory must allow the manufacturer, the manufacturer's approved third-party certifier, the EPA and delegated state regulatory agencies to observe certification testing. However, manufacturers must not involve themselves in the conduct of the test after the pretest burn has begun. Communications between the manufacturer and laboratory or third-party certifier personnel regarding operation of the central heater must be limited to written communications transmitted prior to the first pretest burn of the certification series. During certification tests, the manufacturer may communicate with laboratory personnel only in writing and only to notify them that the manufacturer has observed a deviation from proper test procedures. All communications must be included in the test documentation required to be submitted pursuant to § 60.5475(b)(5) and must be consistent with instructions provided in the owner's manual required under § 60.5478(f), except to the extent that they address details of the certification tests that would not be relevant to owners or regulators.

              Emission Standards
              
                § 60.5515
                Which pollutants are regulated by this subpart?
                (a) The pollutants regulated by this subpart are greenhouse gases. The greenhouse gas standard in this subpart is in the form of a limitation on emission of carbon dioxide.
                (b) PSD and title V thresholds for greenhouse gases. (1) For the purposes of 40 CFR 51.166(b)(49)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in § 51.166(b)(48) of this chapter and in any SIP approved by the EPA that is interpreted to incorporate, or specifically incorporates, § 51.166(b)(48).
                (2) For the purposes of 40 CFR 52.21(b)(50)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in § 52.21(b)(49) of this chapter.
                (3) For the purposes of 40 CFR 70.2, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.
                (4) For the purposes of 40 CFR 71.2, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from affected facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in 40 CFR 71.2.
              
              
                § 60.5520
                What CO2 emissions standard must I meet?

                (a) For each affected EGU subject to this subpart, you must not discharge from the affected EGU any gases that contain CO2 in excess of the applicable CO2 emission standard specified in table 1 or 2 of this subpart, consistent with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, as applicable.

                (b) Except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, you must comply with the applicable gross energy output standard, and your operating permit must include monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting methodologies based on the applicable gross energy output standard. For the remainder of this subpart (for sources that do not qualify under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), where the term “gross or net energy output” is used, the term that applies to you is “gross energy output.”
                (c) As an alternate to meeting the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, an owner or operator of a stationary combustion turbine may petition the Administrator in writing to comply with the alternate applicable net energy output standard. If the Administrator grants the petition, beginning on the date the Administrator grants the petition, the affected EGU must comply with the applicable net energy output-based standard included in this subpart. Your operating permit must include monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting methodologies based on the applicable net energy output standard. For the remainder of this subpart, where the term “gross or net energy output” is used, the term that applies to you is “net energy output.” Owners or operators complying with the net output-based standard must petition the Administrator to switch back to complying with the gross energy output-based standard.
                (d) Stationary combustion turbines subject to a heat input-based standard in table 2 of this subpart that are only permitted to burn one or more uniform fuels, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, are only subject to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (d)(1). All other stationary combustion turbines subject to a heat input based standard in table 2 are subject to the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

                (1) Stationary combustion turbines that are only permitted to burn fuels with a consistent chemical composition (i.e., uniform fuels) that result in a consistent emission rate of 160 lb CO2/MMBtu or less are not subject to any monitoring or reporting requirements under this subpart. These fuels include, but are not limited to, natural gas, methane, butane, butylene, ethane, ethylene, propane, naphtha, propylene, jet fuel kerosene, No. 1 fuel oil, No. 2 fuel oil, and biodiesel. Stationary combustion turbines qualifying under this paragraph are only required to maintain purchase records for permitted fuels.

                (2) Stationary combustion turbines permitted to burn fuels that do not have a consistent chemical composition or that do not have an emission rate of 160 lb CO2/MMBtu or less (e.g., non-uniform fuels such as residual oil and non-jet fuel kerosene) must follow the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements necessary to complete the heat input-based calculations under this subpart.
              
            
            
              General Compliance Requirements
              
                § 60.5525
                What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?

                Combustion turbines qualifying under § 60.5520(d)(1) are not subject to any requirements in this section other than the requirement to maintain fuel purchase records for permitted fuel(s). For all other affected sources, compliance with the applicable CO2 emission standard of this subpart shall be determined on a 12-operating-month rolling average basis. See table 1 or 2 of this subpart for the applicable CO2 emission standards.
                (a) You must be in compliance with the emission standards in this subpart that apply to your affected EGU at all times. However, you must determine compliance with the emission standards only at the end of the applicable operating month, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
                (1) For each affected EGU subject to a CO2 emissions standard based on a 12-operating-month rolling average, you must determine compliance monthly by calculating the average CO2 emissions rate for the affected EGU at the end of the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month period.

                (2) Consistent with § 60.5520(d)(2), if your affected stationary combustion turbine is subject to an input-based CO2 emissions standard, you must determine the total heat input in million Btus (MMBtu) from natural gas (HTIPng) and the total heat input from all other fuels combined (HTIPo) using one of the methods under § 60.5535(d)(2). You must then use the following equation to determine the applicable emissions standard during the compliance period:
                
                  
                  ER23OC15.002
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  CO2 emission standard = the emission standard during the compliance period in units of lb/MMBtu.
                  HTIPng = the heat input in MMBtu from natural gas.
                  HTIPo = the heat input in MMBtu from all fuels other than natural gas.
                  120 = allowable emission rate in lb of CO2/MMBtu for heat input derived from natural gas.
                  160 = allowable emission rate in lb of CO2/MMBtu for heat input derived from all fuels other than natural gas.
                
                
                (b) At all times you must operate and maintain each affected EGU, including associated equipment and monitors, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practice. The Administrator will determine if you are using consistent operation and maintenance procedures based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, fuel use records, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures and records, review of reports required by this subpart, and inspection of the EGU.

                (c) Within 30 days after the end of the initial compliance period (i.e., no more than 30 days after the first 12-operating-month compliance period), you must make an initial compliance determination for your affected EGU(s) with respect to the applicable emissions standard in table 1 or 2 of this subpart, in accordance with the requirements in this subpart. The first operating month included in the initial 12-operating-month compliance period shall be determined as follows:
                (1) For an affected EGU that commences commercial operation (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) on or after October 23, 2015, the first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580) after the calendar month in which emissions reporting is required to begin under:
                (i) Section 63.5555(c)(3)(i), for units subject to the Acid Rain Program; or
                (ii) Section 63.5555(c)(3)(ii)(A), for units that are not in the Acid Rain Program.
                (2) For an affected EGU that has commenced COMMERCIAL operation (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) prior to October 23, 2015:
                (i) If the date on which emissions reporting is required to begin under § 75.64(a) of this chapter has passed prior to October 23, 2015, emissions reporting shall begin according to § 63.5555(c)(3)(i) (for Acid Rain program units), or according to § 63.5555(c)(3)(ii)(B) (for units that are not subject to the Acid Rain Program). The first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580) after the calendar month in which the rule becomes effective; or
                (ii) If the date on which emissions reporting is required to begin under § 75.64(a) of this chapter occurs on or after October 23, 2015, then the first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580) after the calendar month in which emissions reporting is required to begin under § 63.5555(c)(3)(ii)(A).
                (3) For a modified or reconstructed EGU that becomes subject to this subpart, the first month of the initial compliance period shall be the first operating month (as defined in § 60.5580) after the calendar month in which emissions reporting is required to begin under § 63.5555(c)(3)(iii).
              
            
            
              Monitoring and Compliance Determination Procedures
              
                § 60.5535
                How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate compliance?

                (a) Combustion turbines qualifying under § 60.5520(d)(1) are not subject to any requirements in this section other than the requirement to maintain fuel purchase records for permitted fuel(s). If your combustion turbine uses non-uniform fuels as specified under § 60.5520(d)(2), you must monitor heat input in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and you must monitor CO2 emissions in accordance with either paragraph (b), (c)(2), or (c)(5) of this section. For all other affected sources, you must prepare a monitoring plan to quantify the hourly CO2 mass emission rate (tons/h), in accordance with the applicable provisions in § 75.53(g) and (h) of this chapter. The electronic portion of the monitoring plan must be submitted using the ECMPS Client Tool and must be in place prior to reporting emissions data and/or the results of monitoring system certification tests under this subpart. The monitoring plan must be updated as necessary. Monitoring plan submittals must be made by the Designated Representative (DR), the Alternate DR, or a delegated agent of the DR (see § 60.5555(c)).
                (b) You must determine the hourly CO2 mass emissions in kilograms (kg) from your affected EGU(s) according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section, or, if applicable, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

                (1) For an affected coal-fired EGU or for an IGCC unit you must, and for all other affected EGUs you may, install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a CO2 continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) to directly measure and record hourly average CO2 concentrations in the affected EGU exhaust gases emitted to the atmosphere, and a flow monitoring system to measure hourly average stack gas flow rates, according to § 75.10(a)(3)(i) of this chapter. As an alternative to direct measurement of CO2 concentration, provided that your EGU does not use carbon separation (e.g., carbon capture and storage), you may use data from a certified oxygen (O2) monitor to calculate hourly average CO2 concentrations, in accordance with § 75.10(a)(3)(iii) of this chapter. If you measure CO2 concentration on a dry basis, you must also install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a continuous moisture monitoring system, according to § 75.11(b) of this chapter. Alternatively, you may either use an appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value from § 75.11(b) or submit a petition to the Administrator under § 75.66 of this chapter for a site-specific default moisture value.

                (2) For each continuous monitoring system that you use to determine the CO2 mass emissions, you must meet the applicable certification and quality assurance procedures in § 75.20 of this chapter and appendices A and B to part 75 of this chapter.

                (3) You must use only unadjusted exhaust gas volumetric flow rates to determine the hourly CO2 mass emissions rate from the affected EGU; you must not apply the bias adjustment factors described in Section 7.6.5 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter to the exhaust gas flow rate data.
                (4) You must select an appropriate reference method to setup (characterize) the flow monitor and to perform the on-going RATAs, in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. If you use a Type-S pitot tube or a pitot tube assembly for the flow RATAs, you must calibrate the pitot tube or pitot tube assembly; you may not use the 0.84 default Type-S pitot tube coefficient specified in Method 2.
                (5) Calculate the hourly CO2 mass emissions (kg) as described in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section. Perform this calculation only for “valid operating hours”, as defined in § 60.5540(a)(1).
                (i) Begin with the hourly CO2 mass emission rate (tons/h), obtained either from Equation F-11 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (if CO2 concentration is measured on a wet basis), or by following the procedure in section 4.2 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (if CO2 concentration is measured on a dry basis).
                (ii) Next, multiply each hourly CO2 mass emission rate by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), to convert it to tons of CO2.
                

                (iii) Finally, multiply the result from paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section by 909.1 to convert it from tons of CO2 to kg. Round off to the nearest kg.
                (iv) The hourly CO2 tons/h values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO2 mass emissions are required to be recorded under § 75.57(e) of this chapter and must be reported electronically under § 75.64(a)(6) of this chapter. You must use these data to calculate the hourly CO2 mass emissions.
                

                (c) If your affected EGU exclusively combusts liquid fuel and/or gaseous fuel, as an alternative to complying with paragraph (b) of this section, you may determine the hourly CO2 mass emissions according to paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. If you use non-uniform fuels as specified in § 60.5520(d)(2), you may determine CO2 mass emissions during the compliance period according to paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
                (1) If you are subject to an output-based standard and you do not install CEMS in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, you must implement the applicable procedures in appendix D to part 75 of this chapter to determine hourly EGU heat input rates (MMBtu/h), based on hourly measurements of fuel flow rate and periodic determinations of the gross calorific value (GCV) of each fuel combusted.

                (2) For each measured hourly heat input rate, use Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO2 mass emission rate (tons/h). You may determine site-specific carbon-based F-factors (Fc) using Equation F-7b in section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, and you may use these Fc values in the emissions calculations instead of using the default Fc values in the Equation G-4 nomenclature.

                (3) For each “valid operating hour” (as defined in § 60.5540(a)(1), multiply the hourly tons/h CO2 mass emission rate from paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), to convert it to tons of CO2. Then, multiply the result by 909.1 to convert from tons of CO2 to kg. Round off to the nearest two significant figures.
                (4) The hourly CO2 tons/h values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO2 mass emissions are required to be recorded under § 75.57(e) of this chapter and must be reported electronically under § 75.64(a)(6) of this chapter. You must use these data to calculate the hourly CO2 mass emissions.

                (5) If you operate a combustion turbine firing non-uniform fuels, as an alternative to following paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section, you may determine CO2 emissions during the compliance period using one of the following methods:

                (i) Units firing fuel gas may determine the heat input during the compliance period following the procedure under § 60.107a(d) and convert this heat input to CO2 emissions using Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter.
                (ii) You may use the procedure for determining CO2 emissions during the compliance period based on the use of the Tier 3 methodology under § 98.33(a)(3) of this chapter.
                (d) Consistent with § 60.5520, you must determine the basis of the emissions standard that applies to your affected source in accordance with either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable:

                (1) If you operate a source subject to an emissions standard established on an output basis (e.g., lb of CO2 per gross or net MWh of energy output), you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a sufficient number of watt meters to continuously measure and record the hourly gross electric output or net electric output, as applicable, from the affected EGU(s). These measurements must be performed using 0.2 class electricity metering instrumentation and calibration procedures as specified under ANSI Standards No. C12.20 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). For a combined heat and power (CHP) EGU, as defined in § 60.5580, you must also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to continuously (i.e., hour-by-hour) determine and record the total useful thermal output. For process steam applications, you will need to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to continuously determine and record the hourly steam flow rate, temperature, and pressure. Your plan shall ensure that you install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters to record each component of the determination, hour-by-hour.

                (2) If you operate a source subject to an emissions standard established on a heat-input basis (e.g., lb CO2/MMBtu) and your affected source uses non-uniform heating value fuels as delineated under § 60.5520(d), you must determine the total heat input for each fuel fired during the compliance period in accordance with one of the following procedures:
                (i) Appendix D to part 75 of this chapter;
                (ii) The procedures for monitoring heat input under § 60.107a(d);
                (iii) If you monitor CO2 emissions in accordance with the Tier 3 methodology under § 98.33(a)(3) of this chapter, you may convert your CO2 emissions to heat input using the appropriate emission factor in table C-1 of part 98 of this chapter. If your fuel is not listed in table C-1, you must determine a fuel-specific carbon-based F-factor (Fc) in accordance with section 12.3.2 of EPA Method 19 of appendix A-7 to this part, and you must convert your CO2 emissions to heat input using Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter.
                (e) Consistent with § 60.5520, if two or more affected EGUs serve a common electric generator, you must apportion the combined hourly gross or net energy output to the individual affected EGUs according to the fraction of the total steam load contributed by each EGU. Alternatively, if the EGUs are identical, you may apportion the combined hourly gross or net electrical load to the individual EGUs according to the fraction of the total heat input contributed by each EGU.

                (f) In accordance with §§ 60.13(g) and 60.5520, if two or more affected EGUs that implement the continuous emission monitoring provisions in paragraph (b) of this section share a common exhaust gas stack and are subject to the same emissions standard in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart, you may monitor the hourly CO2 mass emissions at the common stack in lieu of monitoring each EGU separately. If you choose this option, the hourly gross or net energy output (electric, thermal, and/or mechanical, as applicable) must be the sum of the hourly loads for the individual affected EGUs and you must express the operating time as “stack operating hours” (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter). If you attain compliance with the applicable emissions standard in § 60.5520 at the common stack, each affected EGU sharing the stack is in compliance.

                (g) In accordance with §§ 60.13(g) and 60.5520 if the exhaust gases from an affected EGU that implements the continuous emission monitoring provisions in paragraph (b) of this section are emitted to the atmosphere through multiple stacks (or if the exhaust gases are routed to a common stack through multiple ducts and you elect to monitor in the ducts), you must monitor the hourly CO2 mass emissions and the “stack operating time” (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) at each stack or duct separately. In this case, you must determine compliance with the applicable emissions standard in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart by summing the CO2 mass emissions measured at the individual stacks or ducts and dividing by the total gross or net energy output for the affected EGU.
              
              
                § 60.5540
                How do I demonstrate compliance with my CO2 emissions standard and determine excess emissions?

                (a) In accordance with § 60.5520, if you are subject to an output-based emission standard or you burn non-uniform fuels as specified in § 60.5520(d)(2), you must demonstrate compliance with the applicable CO2 emission standard in table 1 or 2 of this subpart as required in this section. For the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month rolling average compliance period, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section to calculate the CO2 mass emissions rate for your affected EGU(s) in units of the applicable emissions standard (i.e., either kg/MWh or lb/MMBtu). You must use the hourly CO2 mass emissions calculated under § 60.5535(b) or (c), as applicable, and either the generating load data from § 60.5535(d)(1) for output-based calculations or the heat input data from § 60.5535(d)(2) for heat-input-based calculations. Combustion turbines firing non-uniform fuels that contain CO2 prior to combustion (e.g., blast furnace gas or landfill gas) may sample the fuel stream to determine the quantity of CO2 present in the fuel prior to combustion and exclude this portion of the CO2 mass emissions from compliance determinations.

                (1) Each compliance period shall include only “valid operating hours” in the compliance period, i.e., operating hours for which:

                (i) “Valid data” (as defined in § 60.5580) are obtained for all of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO2 mass emissions (kg) and, if a heat input-based standard applies, all the parameters used to determine total heat input for the hour are also obtained; and

                (ii) The corresponding hourly gross or net energy output value is also valid data (Note: For hours with no useful output, zero is considered to be a valid value).
                (2) You must exclude operating hours in which:

                (i) The substitute data provisions of part 75 of this chapter are applied for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO2 mass emissions or, if a heat input-based standard applies, for any parameters used to determine the hourly heat input; or

                (ii) An exceedance of the full-scale range of a continuous emission monitoring system occurs for any of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO2 mass emissions or, if applicable, to determine the hourly heat input; or
                (iii) The total gross or net energy output (Pgross/net) or, if applicable, the total heat input is unavailable.
                (3) For each compliance period, at least 95 percent of the operating hours in the compliance period must be valid operating hours, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
                (4) You must calculate the total CO2 mass emissions by summing the valid hourly CO2 mass emissions values from § 60.5535 for all of the valid operating hours in the compliance period.
                (5) Sources subject to output based standards. For each valid operating hour of the compliance period that was used in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to calculate the total CO2 mass emissions, you must determine Pgross/net (the corresponding hourly gross or net energy output in MWh) according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, as appropriate for the type of affected EGU(s). For an operating hour in which a valid CO2 mass emissions value is determined according to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, if there is no gross or net electrical output, but there is mechanical or useful thermal output, you must still determine the gross or net energy output for that hour. In addition, for an operating hour in which a valid CO2 mass emissions value is determined according to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, but there is no (i.e., zero) gross electrical, mechanical, or useful thermal output, you must use that hour in the compliance determination. For hours or partial hours where the gross electric output is equal to or less than the auxiliary loads, net electric output shall be counted as zero for this calculation.
                (i) Calculate Pgross/net for your affected EGU using the following equation. All terms in the equation must be expressed in units of megawatt-hours (MWh). To convert each hourly gross or net energy output (consistent with § 60.5520) value reported under part 75 of this chapter to MWh, multiply by the corresponding EGU or stack operating time.

                  (Pt)PS = Useful thermal output of steam (measured relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) that is used for applications that do not generate additional electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU. This is calculated using the equation specified in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section in MWh.
                  (Pt)HR = Non steam useful thermal output (measured relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from heat recovery that is used for applications other than steam generation or performance enhancement of the affected EGU in MWh.
                  (Pt)IE = Useful thermal output (relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from any integrated equipment is used for applications that do not generate additional steam, electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU in MWh.
                  TDF = Electric Transmission and Distribution Factor of 0.95 for a combined heat and power affected EGU where at least on an annual basis 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of electric or direct mechanical output and 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of useful thermal output on a 12-operating-month rolling average basis, or 1.0 for all other affected EGUs.
                
                

                (ii) If applicable to your affected EGU (for example, for combined heat and power), you must calculate (Pt)PS using the following equation:

                  Qm = Measured steam flow in kilograms (kg) (or pounds (lb)) for the operating hour.
                  H = Enthalpy of the steam at measured temperature and pressure (relative to SATP conditions or the energy in the condensate return line, as applicable) in Joules per kilogram (J/kg) (or Btu/lb).
                  CF = Conversion factor of 3.6 × 109 J/MWh or 3.413 × 106 Btu/MWh.
                
                
                (6) Calculation of annual basis for standard. Sources complying with energy output-based standards must calculate the basis (i.e., denominator) of their actual annual emission rate in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. Sources complying with heat input based standards must calculate the basis of their actual annual emission rate in accordance with paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
                (i) In accordance with § 60.5520 if you are subject to an output-based standard, you must calculate the total gross or net energy output for the affected EGU's compliance period by summing the hourly gross or net energy output values for the affected EGU that you determined under paragraph (a)(5) of this section for all of the valid operating hours in the applicable compliance period.
                (ii) If you are subject to a heat input-based standard, you must calculate the total heat input for each fuel fired during the compliance period. The calculation of total heat input for each individual fuel must include all valid operating hours and must also be consistent with any fuel-specific procedures specified within your selected monitoring option under § 60.5535(d)(2).

                (7) If you are subject to an output-based standard, you must calculate the CO2 mass emissions rate for the affected EGU(s) (kg/MWh) by dividing the total CO2 mass emissions value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total gross or net energy output value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section. Round off the result to two significant figures if the calculated value is less than 1,000; round the result to three significant figures if the calculated value is greater than 1,000. If you are subject to a heat input-based standard, you must calculate the CO2 mass emissions rate for the affected EGU(s) (lb/MMBtu) by dividing the total CO2 mass emissions value calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the total heat input calculated according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section. Round off the result to two significant figures.

                (b) In accordance with § 60.5520, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable CO2 emission standard, for the initial and each subsequent 12-operating-month compliance period, the CO2 mass emissions rate for your affected EGU must be determined according to the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) through (7) of this section and must be less than or equal to the applicable CO2 emissions standard in table 1 or 2 of this part, or the emissions standard calculated in accordance with § 60.5525(a)(2).

After you have accumulated the first 12-operating months for the affected EGU, you must submit a report for the calendar quarter that includes the twelfth operating month no later than 30 days after the end of that quarter. Thereafter, you must submit a report for each subsequent calendar quarter, no later than 30 days after the end of the quarter.
                (2) In each quarterly report you must include the following information, as applicable:
                (i) Each rolling average CO2 mass emissions rate for which the last (twelfth) operating month in a 12-operating-month compliance period falls within the calendar quarter. You must calculate each average CO2 mass emissions rate for the compliance period according to the procedures in § 60.5540. You must report the dates (month and year) of the first and twelfth operating months in each compliance period for which you performed a CO2 mass emissions rate calculation. If there are no compliance periods that end in the quarter, you must include a statement to that effect;

                (ii) If one or more compliance periods end in the quarter, you must identify each operating month in the calendar quarter where your EGU violated the applicable CO2 emission standard;
                (iii) If one or more compliance periods end in the quarter and there are no violations for the affected EGU, you must include a statement indicating this in the report;

                (iv) The percentage of valid operating hours in each 12-operating-month compliance period described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (i.e., the total number of valid operating hours (as defined in § 60.5540(a)(1)) in that period divided by the total number of operating hours in that period, multiplied by 100 percent);
                (v) Consistent with § 60.5520, the CO2 emissions standard (as identified in table 1 or 2 of this part) with which your affected EGU must comply; and

                (B) October 23, 2015, if the date on which reporting would ordinarily be required to begin under § 75.64(a) of this chapter has passed prior to October 23, 2015.
                (iii) For reconstructed or modified units, reporting of emissions data shall begin at the date on which the EGU becomes an affected unit under this subpart, provided that the ECMPS Client Tool is able to receive and process net energy output data on that date. Otherwise, emissions data reporting shall be on a gross energy output basis until the date that the Client Tool is first able to receive and process net energy output data.

                (4) If any required monitoring system has not been provisionally certified by the applicable date on which emissions data reporting is required to begin under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the maximum (or in some cases, minimum) potential value for the parameter measured by the monitoring system shall be reported until the required certification testing is successfully completed, in accordance with § 75.4(j) of this chapter, § 75.37(b) of this chapter, or section 2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter (as applicable). Operating hours in which CO2 mass emission rates are calculated using maximum potential values are not “valid operating hours” (as defined in § 60.5540(a)(1)), and shall not be used in the compliance determinations under § 60.5540.
                (d) For affected EGUs subject to the Acid Rain Program, the reports required under paragraphs (a) and (c)(1) of this section shall be submitted by:
                (1) The person appointed as the Designated Representative (DR) under § 72.20 of this chapter; or
                (2) The person appointed as the Alternate Designated Representative (ADR) under § 72.22 of this chapter; or
                (3) A person (or persons) authorized by the DR or ADR under § 72.26 of this chapter to make the required submissions.
                (e) For affected EGUs that are not subject to the Acid Rain Program, the owner or operator shall appoint a DR and (optionally) an ADR to submit the reports required under paragraphs (a) and (c)(2) of this section. The DR and ADR must register with the Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) Business System. The DR may delegate the authority to make the required submissions to one or more persons.
                (f) If your affected EGU captures CO2 to meet the applicable emission limit, you must report in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98, subpart PP and either:

                (1) Report in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98, subpart RR, if injection occurs on-site, or
                
                (2) Transfer the captured CO2 to an EGU or facility that reports in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98, subpart RR, if injection occurs off-site.
                (3) Transfer the captured CO2 to a facility that has received an innovative technology waiver from EPA pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.

                (g) Any person may request the Administrator to issue a waiver of the requirement that captured CO2 from an affected EGU be transferred to a facility reporting under 40 CFR part 98, subpart RR. To receive a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate to the Administrator that its technology will store captured CO2 as effectively as geologic sequestration, and that the proposed technology will not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety. In making this determination, the Administrator shall consider (among other factors) operating history of the technology, whether the technology will increase emissions or other releases of any pollutant other than CO2, and permanence of the CO2 storage. The Administrator may test the system itself, or require the applicant to perform any tests considered by the Administrator to be necessary to show the technology's effectiveness, safety, and ability to store captured CO2 without release. The Administrator may grant conditional approval of a technology, with the approval conditioned on monitoring and reporting of operations. The Administrator may also withdraw approval of the waiver on evidence of releases of CO2 or other pollutants. The Administrator will provide notice to the public of any application under this provision and provide public notice of any proposed action on a petition before the Administrator takes final action.

                What definitions apply to this subpart?
                As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein will have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and in subpart A (general provisions of this part).
                
                  Annual capacity factor means the ratio between the actual heat input to an EGU during a calendar year and the potential heat input to the EGU had it been operated for 8,760 hours during a calendar year at the base load rating.

Stationary means that the combustion turbine is not self-propelled or intended to be propelled while performing its function. It may, however, be mounted on a vehicle for portability. A stationary combustion turbine that burns any solid fuel directly is considered a steam generating unit.
                
                  Steam generating unit means any furnace, boiler, or other device used for combusting fuel and producing steam (nuclear steam generators are not included) plus any integrated equipment that provides electricity or useful thermal output to the affected EGU(s) or auxiliary equipment.

Useful thermal output for affected EGU(s) with no condensate return (or other thermal energy input to the affected EGU(s)) or where measuring the energy in the condensate (or other thermal energy input to the affected EGU(s)) would not meaningfully impact the emission rate calculation is measured against the energy in the thermal output at SATP conditions. Affected EGU(s) with meaningful energy in the condensate return (or other thermal energy input to the affected EGU) must measure the energy in the condensate and subtract that energy relative to SATP conditions from the measured thermal output.

              Source:
              80 FR 64941, Oct. 23, 2015, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              Introduction
              
                § 60.5700
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes emission guidelines and approval criteria for State or multi-State plans that establish emission standards limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an affected steam generating unit, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), or stationary combustion turbine. An affected steam generating unit, IGCC, or stationary combustion turbine shall, for the purposes of this subpart, be referred to as an affected EGU. These emission guidelines are developed in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part. To the extent any requirement of this subpart is inconsistent with the requirements of subparts A or B of this part, the requirements of this subpart will apply.
              
              
                § 60.5705
                Which pollutants are regulated by this subpart?

                (a) The pollutants regulated by this subpart are greenhouse gases. The emission guidelines for greenhouse gases established in this subpart are expressed as carbon dioxide (CO2) emission performance rates and equivalent statewide CO2 emission goals.
                (b) PSD and Title V Thresholds for Greenhouse Gases. (1) For the purposes of § 51.166(b)(49)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from facilities, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in § 51.166(b)(48) and in any State Implementation Plan (SIP) approved by the EPA that is interpreted to incorporate, or specifically incorporates, § 51.166(b)(48) of this chapter.
                (2) For the purposes of § 52.21(b)(50)(ii), with respect to GHG emissions from facilities regulated in the plan, the “pollutant that is subject to the standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act as defined in § 52.21(b)(49) of this chapter.
                (3) For the purposes of § 70.2 of this chapter, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from facilities regulated in the plan, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in § 70.2 of this chapter.
                (4) For the purposes of § 71.2, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions from facilities regulated in the plan, the “pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act” shall be considered to be the pollutant that otherwise is “subject to regulation” as defined in § 71.2 of this chapter.
              
              
                § 60.5710
                Am I affected by this subpart?
                If you are the Governor of a State in the contiguous United States with one or more affected EGUs that commenced construction on or before January 8, 2014, you must submit a State or multi-State plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. If you are the Governor of a State in the contiguous United States with no affected EGUs for which construction commenced on or before January 8, 2014, in your State, you must submit a negative declaration letter in place of the State plan.
              
              
                § 60.5715
                What is the review and approval process for my plan?
                The EPA will review your plan according to § 60.27 except that under § 60.27(b) the Administrator will have 12 months after the date the final plan or plan revision (as allowed under § 60.5785) is submitted, to approve or disapprove such plan or revision or each portion thereof. If you submit an initial submittal under § 60.5765(a) in lieu of a final plan submittal the EPA will follow the procedure in § 60.5765(b).
              
              
                § 60.5720
                What if I do not submit a plan or my plan is not approvable?
                (a) If you do not submit an approvable plan the EPA will develop a Federal plan for your State according to § 60.27. The Federal plan will implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of affected EGUs not covered by an approved plan must comply with a Federal plan implemented by the EPA for the State.
                (b) After a Federal plan has been implemented in your State, it will be withdrawn when your State submits, and the EPA approves, a final plan.
              
              
                § 60.5725
                In lieu of a State plan submittal, are there other acceptable option(s) for a State to meet its CAA section 111(d) obligations?
                A State may meet its CAA section 111(d) obligations only by submitting a final State or multi-State plan submittal or a negative declaration letter (if applicable).
              
              
                § 60.5730
                Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?

                No. The EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, the EPA will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the Federal Register. If, at a later date, an affected EGU for which construction commenced on or before January 8, 2014 is found in your State, you will be found to have failed to submit a final plan as required, and a Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart, when promulgated by the EPA, will apply to that affected EGU until you submit, and the EPA approves, a final State plan.
              
              
                
                § 60.5735
                What authorities will not be delegated to State, local, or tribal agencies?
                The authorities that will not be delegated to State, local, or tribal agencies are specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

                (a) Approval of alternatives, not already approved by this subpart, to the CO2 emission performance rates in table 1 to this subpart established under § 60.5855.

                (b) Approval of alternatives, not already approved by this subpart, to the CO2 emissions goals in tables 2, 3 and 4 to this subpart established under § 60.5855.
              
              
                § 60.5736
                Will the EPA impose any sanctions?
                No. The EPA will not withhold any existing federal funds from a State on account of a State's failure to submit, implement, or enforce an approvable plan or plan revision, or to meet any other requirements under this subpart or subpart B of this part.
              
              
                § 60.5737
                What is the Clean Energy Incentive Program and how do I participate?
                (a) This subpart establishes the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP). Participation in this program is optional. The program enables States to award early action emission rate credits (ERCs) and allowances to eligible renewable energy (RE) or demand-side energy efficiency (EE) projects that generate megawatt hours (MWh) or reduce end-use energy demand during 2020 and/or 2021. Eligible projects are those that:
                (1) Are located in or benefit a state that has submitted a final state plan that includes requirements establishing its participation in the CEIP; and
                (2) Commence construction in the case of RE, or commence operation in the case of demand-side EE, following the submission of a final state plan to the EPA, or after September 6, 2018 for a state that chooses not to submit a final state plan by that date; and either
                (3) Generate metered MWh from any type of wind or solar resources; or
                (4) Result in quantified and verified electricity savings (MWh) through demand-side EE implemented in low-income communities.

                (b) The EPA will award matching ERCs or allowances to States that award early action ERCs or allowances, up to a match limit equivalent to 300 million tons of CO2 emissions. The awards will be executed as follows:
                (1) For RE projects that generate metered MWh from wind or solar resources: For every two MWh generated, the project will receive one early action ERC (or the equivalent number of allowances) from the State, and the EPA will provide one matching ERC (or the equivalent number of allowances) to the State to award to the project.
                (2) For EE projects implemented in low-income communities: For every two MWh in end-use demand savings achieved, the project will receive two early action ERCs (or the equivalent number of allowances) from the State, and the EPA will provide two matching ERCs (or the equivalent number of allowances) to the State to award to the project.
                (c) You may participate in this program by including in your State plan a mechanism that enables issuance of early action ERCs or allowances by the State to parties effectuating reductions in the calendar years 2020 and/or 2021 in a manner that would have no impact on the emission performance of affected EGUs required to meet rate-based or mass-based emission standards during the performance periods. This mechanism is not required to account for matching ERCs or allowances that may be issued to the State by the EPA.

                (d) If you are submitting an initial submittal by September 6, 2016, and you intend to participate in the CEIP, you must include a non-binding statement of intent to participate in the program. If you are submitting a final plan by September 6, 2016, and you intend to participate in the CEIP, your State plan must either include requirements establishing the necessary infrastructure to implement such a program and authorizing your affected EGUs to use early action allowances or ERCs as appropriate, or you must include a non-binding statement of intent as part of your supporting documentation and revise your plan to include the appropriate requirements at a later date.
                (e) If you intend to participate in the CEIP, your final State plan, or plan revision if applicable, must require that projects eligible under this program be evaluated, monitored, and verified, and that resulting ERCs or allowances be issued, per applicable requirements of the State plan approved by the EPA as meeting §§ 60.5805 through 60.5835.
              
            
            
              State and Multi-State Plan Requirements
              
                § 60.5740
                What must I include in my federally enforceable State or multi-State plan?
                (a) You must include the components described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section in your plan submittal. The final plan must meet the requirements and include the information required under § 60.5745.
                (1) Identification of affected EGUs. Consistent with § 60.25(a), you must identify the affected EGUs covered by your plan and all affected EGUs in your State that meet the applicability criteria in § 60.5845. In addition, you must include an inventory of CO2 emissions from the affected EGUs during the most recent calendar year for which data is available prior to the submission of the plan.
                (2) Emission standards. You must include an identification of all emission standards for each affected EGU according to § 60.5775, compliance periods for each emission standard according to § 60.5770, and a demonstration that the emission standards, when taken together, achieve the applicable CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emission goals described in § 60.5855. Allowance systems are an acceptable form of emission standards under this subpart.
                (i) Your plan does not need to include corrective measures specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section if your plan:

                (A) Imposes emission standards on all affected EGUs that, assuming full compliance by all affected EGUs, mathematically assure achievement of the CO2 emission performance rates in the plan for each plan period;

                (B) Imposes emission standards on all affected EGUS that, assuming full compliance by all affected EGUs, mathematically assure achievement of the CO2 emission goals; or

                (C) Imposes emission standards on all affected EGUs that, assuming full compliance by all affected EGUs, in conjunction with applicable requirements under state law for EGUs subject to subpart TTTT of this subpart, assuming the applicable requirements under state law are met by all EGUs subject to subpart TTTT of this subpart, achieve the applicable mass-based CO2 emission goals plus new source CO2 emission complement allowed for in § 60.5790(b)(5).

                (ii) If your plan does not meet the requirements of (a)(2)(i) or (iii) of this section, your plan must include the requirement for corrective measures to be implemented if triggered. Upon triggering corrective measures, if you do not already have them included in your approved State plan, you must submit corrective measures to EPA for approval as a plan revision per the requirements of § 60.5785(c). These corrective measures must ensure that the interim period and final period CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emission goals are achieved by your affected EGUs, as applicable, and must achieve additional emission reductions to offset any emission performance shortfall. Your plan must include the requirement that corrective measures be triggered and implemented according to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section.

                (A) Your plan must include a trigger for an exceedance of an interim step 1 or interim step 2 CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal by 10 percent or greater, either on average or cumulatively (if applicable).

                (B) Your plan must include a trigger for an exceedance of an interim step 1 goal or interim step 2 goal of 10 percent or greater based on either reported CO2 emissions with applied plus or minus net allowance export or import adjustments (if applicable), or based on the adjusted CO2 emission rate (if applicable).

                (C) Your plan must include a trigger for a failure to meet an interim period goal based on reported CO2 emissions with applied plus or minus net allowance export or import adjustments (if applicable), or based on the adjusted CO2 emission rate (if applicable).

                (D) Your plan must include a trigger for a failure to meet the interim period or any final reporting period CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal, either on average or cumulatively (as applicable).

                (E) Your plan must include a trigger for a failure to meet any final reporting period goal based on reported CO2 emissions with applied plus or minus net allowance export or import adjustments (if applicable).

                (F) Your plan must include a trigger for a failure to meet the interim period CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal based on the adjusted CO2 emission rate (if applicable).

                (G) Your plan must include a trigger for a failure to meet any final reporting period CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal based on the adjusted CO2 emission rate (if applicable).

                (H) A net allowance import adjustment represents the CO2 emissions (in tons) equal to the number of net imported CO2 allowances. This adjustment is subtracted from reported CO2 emissions. Under this adjustment, such allowances must be issued by a state with an emission budget trading program that only applies to affected EGUs (or affected EGUs plus EGUs covered by subpart TTTT of this part as applicable). A net allowance export adjustment represents the CO2 emissions (in tons) equal to the number of net exported CO2 allowances. This adjustment is added to reported CO2 emissions.
                (iii) If your plan relies upon State measures, in addition to or in lieu of emission standards on your affected EGUs, then the final State plan must include the requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and the submittal must include the information listed in § 60.5745(a)(6).

                (iv) If your plan requires emission standards in addition to relying upon State measures, then you must demonstrate that the emission standards and State measures, when taken together, result in the achievement of the applicable mass-based CO2 emission goal described in § 60.5855 by your State's affected EGUs.
                (3) State measures backstop. If your plan relies upon State measures, you must submit, as part of the plan in lieu of the requirements in paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, a federally enforceable backstop that includes emission standards for affected EGUs that will be put into place, if there is a triggering event listed in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, within 18 months of the due date of the report required in § 60.5870(b). The emission standards on the affected EGUs as part of the backstop must be able to meet either the CO2 emission performance rates or mass-based or rate-based CO2 emission goal for your State during the interim and final periods. You must either submit, along with the backstop emission standards, provisions to adjust the emission standards to make up for the prior emission performance shortfall, such that no later plan revision to modify the emission standards is necessary in order to address the emission performance shortfall, or you must submit, as part of the final plan, backstop emission standards that assure affected EGUs would achieve your State's CO2 emission performance rates or emission goals during the interim and final periods, and then later submit appropriate revisions to the backstop emission standards adjusting for the shortfall through the State plan revision process described in § 60.5785. The backstop must also include the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable.
                (i) You must include a trigger for the backstop to go into effect upon:
                (A) A failure to meet a programmatic milestone;

                (B) An exceedance of 10 percent or greater of an interim step 1 goal or interim step 2 goal based on reported CO2 emissions, with applied plus or minus net allowance export or import adjustments (if applicable);

                (C) A failure to meet the interim period goal based on reported CO2 emissions, with applied plus or minus net allowance export or import adjustments (if applicable); or

                (D) A failure to meet any final reporting period goal based on reported CO2 emissions, with applied plus or minus net allowance export or import adjustments (if applicable).
                (ii) You may include in your plan any additional triggers so long as they do not reduce the stringency of the triggers required under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
                (iii) You must include a schedule for implementation of the backstop once triggered, and you must identify all necessary State administrative and technical procedures for implementing the backstop.
                (4) Identification of applicable monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for each affected EGU. You must include in your plan all applicable monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for each affected EGU and the requirements must be consistent with or no less stringent than the requirements specified in § 60.5860.
                (5) State reporting. You must include in your plan a description of the process, contents, and schedule for State reporting to the EPA about plan implementation and progress, including information required under § 60.5870.
                (i) You must include in your plan a requirement for a report to be submitted by July 1, 2021, that demonstrates that the State has met, or is on track to meet, the programmatic milestone steps indicated in the timeline required in § 60.5770.
                (ii) [Reserved]
                (b) You must follow the requirements of subpart B of this part and demonstrate that they were met in your State plan. However, the provisions of § 60.24(f) shall not apply.
              
              
                § 60.5745
                What must I include in my final plan submittal?
                (a) In addition to the components of the plan listed in § 60.5740, a final plan submittal to the EPA must include the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (13) of this section. This information must be submitted to the EPA as part of your final plan submittal but will not be codified as part of the federally enforceable plan upon approval by EPA.

                (1) You must include a description of your plan approach and the geographic scope of the plan (i.e., State or multi-State, geographic boundaries related to the plan elements), including, if applicable, identification of multi-State plan participants.
                (2) You must identify CO2 emission performance rates or equivalent statewide CO2 emission goals that your affected EGUs will achieve. If the geographic scope of your plan is a single State, then you must identify CO2 emission performance rates or emission goals according to § 60.5855. If your plan includes multiple States and you elect to set CO2 emission goals, you must identify CO2 emission goals calculated according to § 60.5750.
                (i) You must specify in the plan submittal the CO2 emission performance rates or emission goals that affected EGUs will meet for the interim period, each interim step, and the final period (including each final reporting period) pursuant to § 60.5770.
                (ii) [Reserved]

                (3) You must include a demonstration that the affected EGUs covered by the plan are projected to achieve the CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emission goals described in § 60.5855.
                (4) You must include a demonstration that each affected EGU's emission standard is quantifiable, non-duplicative, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable according to § 60.5775.

                (5) If your plan includes emission standards on your affected EGUs sufficient to meet either the CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emission goals, you must include in your plan submittal the information in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (v) of this section as applicable.
                (i) If your plan applies separate rate-based CO2 emission standards for affected EGUs (in lbs CO2/MWh) that are equal to or lower than the CO2 emission performance rates listed in table 1 of this subpart or uniform rate-based CO2 emission standards equal to or lower than the rate-based CO2 emission goals listed in table 2 of this subpart, then no additional demonstration is required beyond inclusion of the emission standards in the plan.

                (ii) If a plan applies rate-based emission standards to individual affected EGUs at a lbs CO2/MWh rate that differs from the CO2 emission performance rates in table 1 of this subpart or the State's rate-based CO2 emission goal in table 2 of this subpart, then a further demonstration is required that the application of the CO2 emission standards will achieve the CO2 emission performance rates or State rate-based CO2 emission goal. You must demonstrate through a projection that the adjusted weighted average CO2 emission rate of affected EGUs, when weighted by generation (in MWh), will be equal to or less than the CO2 emission performance rates or the rate-based CO2 emission goal. This projection must address the interim period and the final period. The projection in the plan submittal must include the information listed in paragraph (a)(5)(v) of this section and in addition the following:
                (A) An analysis of the change in generation of affected EGUs given the compliance costs and incentives under the application of different emission rate standards across affected EGUs in a State;
                (B) A projection showing how generation is expected to shift between affected EGUs and across affected EGUs and non-affected EGUs over time;
                (C) Assumptions regarding the availability and anticipated use of the MWh of electricity generation or electricity savings from eligible resources that can be issued ERCs;

                (D) The specific calculation (or assumption) of how eligible resource MWh of electricity generation or savings are being used in the projection to adjust the reported CO2 emission rate of affected EGUs;
                (E) If a state plan provides for the ability of renewable energy resources located in states with mass-based plans to be issued ERCs, consideration in the projection that such resources must meet geographic eligibility requirements, consistent with § 60.5800(a); and
                (F) Any other applicable assumptions used in the projection.

                (iii) If a plan establishes mass-based emission standards for affected EGUs that cumulatively do not exceed the State's EPA-specified mass CO2 emission goal, then no additional demonstration is required beyond inclusion of the emission standards in the plan.

                (iv) If a plan applies mass-based emission standards to individual affected EGUs that cumulatively exceed the State's EPA-specified mass CO2 emission goal, then you must include a demonstration that your mass-based emission program will be designed such that compliance by affected EGUs would achieve the State mass-based CO2 emission goals. This demonstration includes the information listed in paragraph (a)(5)(v) of this section.
                (v) Your plan demonstration to be included in your plan submittal, if applicable, must include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(5)(v)(A) through (L) of this section.
                (A) A summary of each affected EGU's anticipated future operation characteristics, including:
                (1) Annual generation;
                (2) CO2 emissions;
                (3) Fuel use, fuel prices (when applicable), fuel carbon content;
                (4) Fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs (when applicable);
                (5) Heat rates; and
                (6) Electric generation capacity and capacity factors.
                (B) An identification of any planned new electric generating capacity.
                (C) Analytic treatment of the potential for building unplanned new electric generating capacity.

                (ii) You must include the schedule and milestones for the implementation of the State measures. If the State measures in your plan submittal rely upon measures that do not have a direct effect on the CO2 emissions measured at an affected EGU's stack, you must also demonstrate how the minimum emission, monitoring and verification (EM&V) requirements listed under § 60.5795 that apply to those programs and projects will be met.

                (iii) You must demonstrate that federally enforceable emission standards for affected EGUs in conjunction with any State measures relied upon for your plan, are sufficient to achieve the mass-based CO2 emission goal for the interim period, each interim step in that interim period, the final period, and each final reporting period. In addition, you must demonstrate that each emission standard included in your plan meets the requirements of § 60.5775 and each State measure included in your plan submittal meets the requirements of § 60.5780.

                § 60.5750
                Can I work with other States to develop a multi-State plan?
                A multi-State plan must include all the required elements for a plan specified in § 60.5740(a). A multi-State plan must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

                (a) The multi-State plan must demonstrate that all affected EGUs in all participating States will meet the CO2 emission performance rates listed in table 1 of this subpart or an equivalent CO2 emission goal according to paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section. States may only follow the procedures in (a)(1) or (2) if they have functionally equivalent requirements meeting §§ 60.5775 and 60.5790 included in their plans.

                (1) For States electing to demonstrate performance with a CO2 emission rate-based goal, the CO2 emission goals identified in the plan according to § 60.5855 will be an adjusted weighted (by net energy output) average lbs CO2/MWh emission rate to be achieved by all affected EGUs in the multi-State area during the plan periods; or

                (2) For States electing to demonstrate performance with a CO2 emission mass-based goal, the CO2 emission goals identified in the multi-State plan according to § 60.5855 will be total mass CO2 emissions by all affected EGUs in the multi-State area during the plan periods, representing the sum of all individual mass CO2 goals for states participating in the multi-state plan.
                (b) Options for submitting a multi-State plan include the following:
                (1) States participating in a multi-State plan may submit one multi-State plan submittal on behalf of all participating States. The joint submittal must be signed electronically, according to § 60.5875, by authorized officials for each of the States participating in the multi-State plan. In this instance, the joint submittal will have the same legal effect as an individual submittal for each participating State. The joint submittal must address plan components that apply jointly for all participating States and components that apply for each individual State in the multi-State plan, including necessary State legal authority to implement the plan, such as State regulations and statutes.
                (2) States participating in a multi-State plan may submit a single plan submittal, signed by authorized officials from each participating State, which addresses common plan elements. Each participating State must, in addition, provide individual plan submittals that address State-specific elements of the multi-State plan.
                (3) States participating in a multi-State plan may separately make individual submittals that address all elements of the multi-State plan. The plan submittals must be materially consistent for all common plan elements that apply to all participating States, and also must address individual State-specific aspects of the multi-State plan. Each individual State plan submittal must address all required plan components in § 60.5740.
                (c) A State may elect to participate in more than one multi-State plan. If your State elects to participate in more than one multi-State plan then you must identify in the State plan submittal required under § 60.5745, the subset of affected EGUs that are subject to the specific multi-State plan or your State's individual plan. An affected EGU can only be subject to one plan.

                (d) A State may elect to allow its affected EGUs to interact with affected EGUs in other States through mass-based trading programs or a rate-based trading program without entering into a formal multi-State plan allowed for under this section, so long as such programs are part of an EPA-approved state plan and meet the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable.
                (1) For States that elect to do mass-based trading under this option the State must indicate in its plan that its emission budget trading program will be administered using an EPA-approved (or EPA-administered) emission and allowance tracking system.

                (2) For States that elect to use a rate-based trading program which allows the affected EGUs to use ERCs from other State rate-based trading programs, the plan must require affected EGUs within their State to comply with emission standards equal to the sub-category CO2 emission performance rates in table 1 of this subpart.
              
              
                § 60.5760
                What are the timing requirements for submitting my plan?
                (a) You must submit a final plan with the information required under § 60.5745 by September 6, 2016, unless you are submitting an initial submittal, allowed under § 60.5765, in lieu of a final State plan submittal, according to paragraph (b) of this section.
                (b) For States seeking a two year extension for a final plan submittal, you must include the information in § 60.5765(a) in an initial submittal by September 6, 2016, to receive an extension to submit your final State plan submittal by September 6, 2018.
                (c) You must submit all information required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section according to the electronic reporting requirements in § 60.5875.
              
              
                § 60.5765
                What must I include in an initial submittal if requesting an extension for a final plan submittal?
                (a) You must sufficiently demonstrate that your State is able to undertake steps and processes necessary to timely submit a final plan by the extended date of September 6, 2018, by addressing the following required components in an initial submittal by September 6, 2016, if requesting an extension for a final plan submittal:
                (1) An identification of final plan approach or approaches under consideration and a description of progress made to date on the final plan components;
                (2) An appropriate explanation of why the State requires additional time to submit a final plan by September 6, 2018; and
                (3) A demonstration or description of the opportunity for public comment on the initial submittal and meaningful engagement with stakeholders, including vulnerable communities, during the time in preparation of the initial submittal and the plans for engagement during development of the final plan.
                (b) You must submit an initial submittal allowed in paragraph (a) of this section, information required under paragraph (c) of this section (only if a State elects to submit an initial submittal to request an extension for a final plan submittal), and a final State plan submittal according to § 60.5870. If a State submits an initial submittal, an extension for a final State plan submittal is considered granted and a final State plan submittal is due according to § 60.5760(b) unless a State is notified within 90 days of the EPA receiving the initial submittal that the EPA finds the initial submittal does not meet the requirements listed in paragraph (a) of this section. If the EPA notifies the State that the initial submittal does not meet such requirements, the EPA will also notify the State that it has failed to submit the final plan required by September 6, 2016.
                (c) If an extension for submission of a final plan has been granted, you must submit a progress report by September 6, 2017. The 2017 report must include the following:
                (1) A summary of the status of each component of the final plan, including an update from the 2016 initial submittal and a list of which final plan components are not complete.
                (2) A commitment to a plan approach (e.g., single or multi-State, rate-based or mass-based emission performance level, rate-based or mass-based emission standards), including draft or proposed legislation and/or regulations.

                (3) An updated comprehensive roadmap with a schedule and milestones for completing the final plan, including any updates to community engagement undertaken and planned.
              
              
                § 60.5770
                What schedules, performance periods, and compliance periods must I include in my plan?

                (a) The affected EGUs covered by your plan must meet the CO2 emission requirements required under § 60.5855 for the interim period, interim steps, and the final reporting periods according to paragraph (b) of this section. You must also include in your plan compliance periods for each affected EGU regulated under the plan according to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

                (b) Your plan must require your affected EGUs to achieve each CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal, as applicable, required under § 60.5855 over the periods according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) The interim period.
                (2) Each interim step.
                (3) Each final reporting period.
                (c) The emission standards for affected EGUs regulated under the plan must include the following compliance periods:
                (1) For the interim period, affected EGUs must have emission standards that have compliance periods that are no longer than each interim step and are imposed for the entirety of the interim step either alone or in combination.
                (2) For the final period, affected EGUs must have emission standards that have compliance periods that are no longer than each final reporting period and are imposed for the entirety of the final reporting period either alone or in combination.
                (3) Compliance periods for each interim step and each final reporting period may take forms shorter than specified in this regulation, provided the schedules of compliance collectively end on the same schedule as each interim step and final reporting period.
                (d) If your plan relies upon State measures in lieu of or in addition to emission standards for affected EGUs regulated under the plan, then the performance periods must be identical to the compliance periods for affected EGUs listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
              
              
                § 60.5775
                What emission standards must I include in my plan?
                (a) Emission standard(s) for affected EGUs included under your plan must be demonstrated to be quantifiable, verifiable, non-duplicative, permanent, and enforceable with respect to each affected EGU. The plan submittal must include the methods by which each emission standard meets each of the following requirements in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
                (b) An affected EGU's emission standard is quantifiable if it can be reliably measured in a manner that can be replicated.
                (c) An affected EGU's emission standard is verifiable if adequate monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements are in place to enable the State and the Administrator to independently evaluate, measure, and verify compliance with the emission standard.
                (d) An affected EGU's emission standard is non-duplicative with respect to a State plan if it is not already incorporated as an emission standard in another State plan unless incorporated in multi-State plan.
                (e) An affected EGU's emission standard is permanent if the emission standard must be met for each compliance period, unless it is replaced by another emission standard in an approved plan revision, or the State demonstrates in an approvable plan revision that the emission reductions from the emission standard are no longer necessary for the State to meet its State level of performance.
                (f) An affected EGU's emission standard is enforceable if:
                (1) A technically accurate limitation or requirement and the time period for the limitation or requirement are specified;
                (2) Compliance requirements are clearly defined;
                (3) The affected EGUs responsible for compliance and liable for violations can be identified;

                (4) Each compliance activity or measure is enforceable as a practical matter; and
                
                (5) The Administrator, the State, and third parties maintain the ability to enforce against violations (including if an affected EGU does not meet its emission standard based on its emissions, its allowances if it is subject to a mass-based emission standard, or its ERCs if it is subject to a rate-based emission standard) and secure appropriate corrective actions, in the case of the Administrator pursuant to CAA sections 113(a)-(h), in the case of a State, pursuant to its plan, State law or CAA section 304, as applicable, and in the case of third parties, pursuant to CAA section 304.
              
              
                § 60.5780
                What State measures may I rely upon in support of my plan?
                You may rely upon State measures in support of your plan that are not emission standard(s) on affected EGUs, provided those State measures meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.

                (a) Each State measure is quantifiable, verifiable, non-duplicative, permanent, and enforceable with respect to each affected entity (e.g., entities other than affected EGUs with no federally enforceable obligations under a State plan), and your plan supporting materials include the methods by which each State measure meets each of the following requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
                (1) A State measure is quantifiable with respect to an affected entity if it can be reliably measured in a manner that can be replicated.
                (2) A State measure is verifiable with respect to an affected entity if adequate monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements are in place to enable the State to independently evaluate, measure, and verify compliance with the State measure.
                (3) A State measure is non-duplicative with respect to an affected entity if it is not already incorporated as a State measure or an emission standard in another State plan or State plan supporting material unless incorporated in a multi-State plan.

                (4) A State measure is permanent with respect to an affected entity if the State measure must be met for at least each compliance period, or unless either it is replaced by another State measure in an approved plan revision, or the State demonstrates in an approved plan revision that the emission reductions from the State measure are no longer necessary for the State's affected EGUs to meet their mass-based CO2 emission goal.
                (5) A State measure is enforceable against an affected entity if:
                (i) A technically accurate limitation or requirement and the time period for the limitation or requirement are specified;
                (ii) Compliance requirements are clearly defined;
                (iii) The affected entities responsible for compliance and liable for violations can be identified;
                (iv) Each compliance activity or measure is enforceable as a practical matter; and
                (v) The State maintains the ability to enforce violations and secure appropriate corrective actions.
                (b) [Reserved]
              
              
                § 60.5785
                What is the procedure for revising my plan?

                (a) EPA-approved plans can be revised only with approval by the Administrator. The Administrator will approve a plan revision if it is satisfactory with respect to the applicable requirements of this subpart and any applicable requirements of subpart B of this part, including the requirement in § 60.5745(a)(3) to demonstrate achievement of the CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emission goals in § 60.5855. If one (or more) of the elements of the plan set in § 60.5740 require revision with respect to achieving the CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emission goals in § 60.5855, a request must be submitted to the Administrator indicating the proposed revisions to the plan to ensure the CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emission goals are met. In addition, the following provisions in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section may apply.
                (b) You may submit revisions to a plan to adjust CO2 emission goals according to § 60.5855(d).

                (c) If your State is required to submit a notification according to § 60.5870(d) indicating a triggering of corrective measures as described in § 60.5740(a)(2)(i) and your plan does not already include corrective measures to be implemented if triggered, you must revise your State plan to include corrective measures to be implemented. The corrective measures must ensure achievement of the CO2 emission performance rates or State CO2 emission goal. Additionally, the corrective measures must achieve additional CO2 emission reductions to offset any CO2 emission performance shortfall relative to the overall interim period or final period CO2 emission performance rate or State CO2 emission goal. The State plan revision submission must explain how the corrective measures both make up for the shortfall and address the State plan deficiency that caused the shortfall. The State must submit the revised plan and explanation to the EPA within 24 months after submitting the State report required in § 60.5870(a) indicating the CO2 emission performance deficiency in lieu of the requirements of § 60.28(a). The State must implement corrective measures within 6 months of the EPA's approval of a plan revision adding them. The shortfall must be made up as expeditiously as practicable.
                (d) If your plan relies upon State measures, your backstop is triggered under § 60.5740(a)(3)(i), and your State measures plan backstop does not include a mechanism to make up the shortfall, you must revise your backstop emission standards to make up the shortfall. The shortfall must be made up as expeditiously as practicable.
                (e) Reliability Safety Valve:

                (1) In order to trigger a reliability safety valve, you must notify the EPA within 48 hours of an unforeseen, emergency situation that threatens reliability, such that your State will need a short-term modification of emission standards under a State plan for a specified affected EGU or EGUs. The EPA will consider the notification in § 60.5870(g)(1) to be an approved short-term modification to the State plan without needing to go through the full State plan revision process if the State provides a second notification to the EPA within seven days of the first notification. The short-term modification under a reliability safety valve allows modification to emission standards under the State plan for an affected EGU or EGUs for an initial period of up to 90 days. During that period of time, the affected EGU or EGUs will need to comply with the modified emission standards identified in the initial notification required under § 60.5870(g)(1) or amended in the second notification required under § 60.5870(g)(2). For the duration of the up to 90-day short-term modification, the CO2 emissions of the affected EGU or EGUs that exceed their obligations under the originally approved State plan will not be counted against the State's CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal. The EPA reserves the right to review any such notification required under § 60.5870(g), and, in the event that the EPA finds such notification is improper, the EPA may disallow the short-term modification and affected EGUs must continue to operate under the approved State plan emission standards. As described more fully in § 60.5870(g)(3), at least seven days before the end of the initial 90-day reliability safety valve period, the State must notify the appropriate EPA regional office whether the reliability concern has been addressed and the affected EGU or EGUs can resume meeting the original emission standards established in the State plan prior to the short-term modification or whether a serious, ongoing reliability issue necessitates the affected EGU or EGUs emitting beyond the amount allowed under the State plan.
                (2) Plan revisions submitted pursuant to § 60.5870(g)(3) must meet the requirements for State plan revisions under § 60.5785(a).
              
              
                § 60.5790
                What must I do to meet my plan obligations?

                (a) To meet your plan obligations, you must demonstrate that your affected EGUs are complying with their emission standards as specified in § 60.5740, and you must demonstrate that the emission standards on affected EGUs, alone or in conjunction with any State measures, are resulting in achievement of the CO2 emission performance rates or statewide CO2 emission goals by affected EGUs using the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. If your plan requires the use of allowances for your affected EGUs to comply with their mass-based emission standards, you must follow the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section and § 60.5830. If your plan requires the use of ERCs for your affected EGUs to comply with their rate-based emission standards, you must follow the requirements under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and §§ 60.5795 through 60.5805.
                (b) If you submit a plan that sets a mass-based emission trading program for your affected EGUs, the State plan must include emission standards and requirements that specify the allowance system, related compliance requirements and mechanisms, and the emission budget as appropriate. These requirements must include those listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.
                (1) CO2 emission monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for affected EGUs.
                (2) Requirements for State allocation of allowances consistent with § 60.5815.
                (3) Requirements for tracking of allowances, from issuance through submission for compliance, consistent with § 60.5820.

                (4) The process for affected EGUs to demonstrate compliance (allowance “true-up” with reported CO2 emissions) consistent with § 60.5825.

                (5) Requirements that address potential increased CO2 emissions from new sources, beyond the emissions expected from new sources if affected EGUs were given emission standards in the form of the subcategory-specific CO2 emission performance rates. You may meet this requirement by requiring one of the options under paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.

                (i) You may include, as part of your plan's supporting documentation, requirements enforceable as a matter of State law regulating CO2 emissions from EGUs covered by subpart TTTT of this part under the mass-based CO2 goal plus new source CO2 emission complement applicable to your State in table 4 of this subpart. If you choose this option, the term “mass-based CO2 goal plus new source CO2 emission complement” shall apply rather than “CO2 mass-based goal” and the term “CO2 emission goal” shall include “mass-based CO2 goal plus new source CO2 emission complement” in these emission guidelines.

                (ii) You may include requirements in your State plan for emission budget allowance allocation methods that align incentives to generate to affected EGUs or EGUs covered by subpart TTTT of this part that result in the affected EGUs meeting the mass-based CO2 emission goal;

                (iii) You may submit for the EPA's approval, an equivalent method which requires affected EGUs to meet the mass-based CO2 emission goal. The EPA will evaluate the approvability of such an alternative method on a case by case basis.
                (c) If you submit a plan that sets rate-based emission standards on your affected EGUs, to meet the requirements of § 60.5775, you must follow the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.

                (1) You must require the owner or operator of each affected EGU covered by your plan to calculate an adjusted CO2 emission rate to demonstrate compliance with its emission standard by factoring stack emissions and any ERCs into the following equation:
                
                  ER23OC15.005
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  CO2 emission rate = An affected EGU's adjusted CO2 emission rate that will be used to determine compliance with the applicable CO2 emission standard.
                  MCO2 = Measured CO2 mass in units of pounds (lbs) summed over the compliance period for an affected EGU.
                  MWhop = Total net energy output over the compliance period for an affected EGU in units of MWh.
                  
                  MWhERC = ERC replacement generation for an affected EGU in units of MWh (ERCs are denominated in whole integers as specified in paragraph (d) of this section).
                
                
                (2) Your plan must specify that an ERC qualifies for the compliance demonstration specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the ERC meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.
                (i) An ERC must have a unique serial number.

                (ii) An ERC must represent one MWh of actual energy generated or saved with zero associated CO2 emissions.
                (iii) An ERC must only be issued to an eligible resource that meets the requirements of § 60.5800 or to an affected EGU that meets the requirements of § 60.5795 and must only be issued by a State or its State agent through an EPA-approved ERC tracking system that meets the requirements of § 60.5810, or by the EPA through an EPA-administered tracking system.
                (iv) An ERC must be surrendered and retired only once for purpose of compliance with this regulation through an EPA-approved ERC tracking system that meets the requirements of § 60.5810, or by the EPA through an EPA-administered tracking system.

                (3) Your plan must specify that an ERC does not qualify for the compliance demonstration specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if it does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section or if any State has used that same ERC for purposes of demonstrating achievement of a CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal. The plan must additionally include provisions that address requirements for revocation or adjustment that apply if an ERC issued by the State is subsequently found to have been improperly issued.
                (4) Your plan must include provisions either allowing for or restricting banking of ERCs between compliance periods for affected EGUs, and provisions not allowing any borrowing of any ERCs from future compliance periods by affected EGUs or eligible resources.
              
            
            
              Emission Rate Credit Requirements
              
                § 60.5795
                What affected EGUs qualify for generation of ERCs?

                (a) For issuance of ERCs to the affected EGUs that generate them, the plan must specify the accounting method and process for ERC issuance. For plans that require that affected EGUs meet a rate-based CO2 emission goal, where all affected EGUs have identical emission standards, you must specify the accounting method listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for generating ERCs. For plans that require affected EGUs to meet the CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emission goals where affected EGUs have emission standards that are not equal for all affected EGUs, you must specify the accounting methods listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for generating ERCs.

                (1) You must include the calculation method for determining the number of ERCs, denominated in MWh, that may be generated by and issued to an affected EGU that is in compliance with its emission standard, based on the difference between its emission standard and its reported CO2 emission rate for the compliance period; and
                (2) You must include the calculation method for determining the number of ERCs, denominated in MWh, that may be issued to affected EGUs that meet the definition of a stationary combustion turbine based on the displaced emissions from affected EGUs not meeting the definition of a stationary combustion turbine, resulting from the difference between its annualized net energy output in MWh for the calendar year(s) in the compliance period and its net energy output in MWh for the 2012 calendar year (January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012).
                (b) Any ERCs generated through the method described as required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section must not be used by any affected EGUs other than steam generating units or IGCCs to demonstrate compliance as prescribed under § 60.5790(c)(1).

                (c) Any states in a multi-State plan that requires the use of ERCs for affected EGUs to comply with their emission standards must have functionally equivalent requirements pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for generating ERCs.
              
              
                § 60.5800
                What other resources qualify for issuance of ERCs?
                (a) ERCs may only be issued for generation or savings produced on or after January 1, 2022, to a resource that qualifies as an eligible resource because it meets each of the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
                (1) Resources qualifying for eligibility only include resources that increased installed electrical generation nameplate capacity, or implemented new electrical savings measures, on or after January 1, 2013. If a resource had a nameplate capacity uprate, ERCs may be issued only for the difference in generation between its uprated nameplate capacity and its nameplate capacity prior to the uprate. ERCs must not be issued for generation for an uprate that followed a derate that occurred on or after January 1, 2013. A resource that is relicensed or receives a license extension is considered existing capacity and is not an eligible resource, unless it receives a capacity uprate as a result of the relicensing process that is reflected in its relicensed permit. In such a case, only the difference in nameplate capacity between its relicensed permit and its prior permit is eligible to be issued ERCs.
                (2) The resource must be connected to, and deliver energy to or save electricity on, the electric grid in the contiguous United States.
                (3) The resource must be located in either:
                (i) A State whose affected EGUs are subject to rate-based emission standards pursuant to this regulation; or
                (ii) A State with a mass-based CO2 emission goal, and the resource can demonstrate (e.g., through a power purchase agreement or contract for delivery) that the electricity generated is delivered with the intention to meet load in a State with affected EGUs which are subject to rate-based emission standards pursuant to this regulation, and was treated as a generation resource used to serve regional load that included the State whose affected EGUs are subject to rate-based emission standards. Notwithstanding any other provision of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the only type of eligible resource in the State with mass-based emission standards is renewable generating technologies listed in (a)(4)(i) of this section.
                (4) The resource falls into one of the following categories of resources:
                (i) Renewable electric generating technologies using one of the following renewable energy resources: Wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, wave, tidal;
                (ii) Qualified biomass;
                (iii) Waste-to-energy (biogenic portion only);
                (iv) Nuclear power;
                (v) A non-affected combined heat and power (CHP) unit, including waste heat power;
                (vi) A demand-side EE or demand-side management measure that saves electricity and is calculated on the basis of quantified ex post savings, not “projected” or “claimed” savings; or
                (vii) A category identified in a State plan and approved by the EPA to generate ERCs.
                (b) Any resource that does not meet the requirements of this subpart or an approved State plan cannot be issued ERCs for use by an affected EGU with its compliance demonstration required under § 60.5790(c).
                (c) ERCs may not be issued to or for any of the following:
                (1) New, modified, or reconstructed EGUs that are subject to subpart TTTT of this part, except CHP units that meet the requirements of a CHP unit under paragraph (a);
                (2) EGUs that do not meet the applicability requirements of §§ 60.5845 and 60.5850, except CHP units that meet the requirements of a CHP unit under paragraph (a);
                (3) Measures that reduce CO2 emissions outside the electric power sector, including, for example, GHG offset projects representing emission reductions that occur in the forestry and agriculture sectors, direct air capture, and crediting of CO2 emission reductions that occur in the transportation sector as a result of vehicle electrification; and

                (4) Any measure not approved by the EPA for issuance of ERCs in connection with a specific State plan.
                
                (d) You must include the appropriate requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section for an applicable eligible resource in your plan.

                (1) If qualified biomass is an eligible resource, the plan must include a description of why the proposed feedstocks or feedstock categories should qualify as an approach for controlling increases of CO2 levels in the atmosphere as well as the proposed valuation of biogenic CO2 emissions. In addition, for sustainably-derived agricultural and forest biomass feedstocks, the state plan must adequately demonstrate that such feedstocks appropriately control increases of CO2 levels in the atmosphere and methods for adequately monitoring and verifying these feedstock sources and related sustainability practices. For all qualified biomass feedstocks, plans must specify how biogenic CO2 emissions will be monitored and reported, and identify specific EM&V, tracking and auditing approaches.

                (2) If waste-to-energy is an eligible resource, the plan must assess both the capacity to strengthen existing or implement new waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting programs, and measures to minimize any potential negative impacts of waste-to-energy operations on such programs. Additionally the plan must include a method for determining the proportion of total MWh generation from a waste-to-energy facility that is eligible for use in adjusting a CO2 emission rate (i.e., that which is generated from biogenic materials).

                (3) If carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is an eligible resource in a plan, the plan must include analysis supporting how the proposed qualifying CCU technology results in CO2 emission mitigation from affected EGUs and provide monitoring, reporting, and verification requirements to demonstrate the reductions.

                (e) States and areas of Indian country that do not have any affected EGUs, and other countries, may provide ERCs to adjust CO2 emissions provided they are connected to the contiguous U.S. grid and meet the other requirements for eligibility and eligible resources and the issuance of ERCs included in these emission guidelines, except that such States and other countries may not provide ERCs from resources described in § 60.5800(a)(4)(vi).
              
              
                § 60.5805
                What is the process for the issuance of ERCs?
                If your plan uses ERCs your plan must include the process and requirements for issuance of ERCs to affected EGUs and eligible resources set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.
                (a) Eligibility application. Your plan must require that, to receive ERCs, the owner or operator must submit an eligibility application to you that demonstrates that the requirements of your State plan as approved by the EPA as meeting § 60.5795 (for an affected EGU) or § 60.5800 (for an eligible resource) are met, and, in the case of an eligible resource, includes at a minimum:
                (1) Documentation that the eligibility application has only been submitted to you, or pursuant to an EPA-approved multi-State collaborative approach;
                (2) An EM&V plan that meets the requirements of the State plan as approved by the EPA as meeting § 60.5830; and
                (3) A verification report from an independent verifier that verifies the eligibility of the eligible resource to be issued an ERC and that the EM&V plan meets the requirements of the State plan as approved by the EPA of meeting § 60.5805.
                (b) Registration. Your plan must require that any affected EGU or eligible resource register with an ERC tracking system that meets the requirements of § 60.5810 prior to the issuance of ERCs, and your plan must specify that you will only register an affected EGU or eligible resource after you approve its eligibility application and determine that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met.
                (c) M&V reports. For an eligible resource registered pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, your plan must require that, prior to issuance of ERCs by you, the owner or operator must submit the following:
                
                (1) An M&V report that meets the requirements of your State plan as approved by the EPA as meeting § 60.5835; and
                (2) A verification report from an independent verifier that verifies that the requirements for the M&V report are met.
                (d) [Reserved]
                (e) Issuance of ERCs. Your plan must specify your procedure for issuance of ERCs based on your review of an M&V report and verification report, and must require that ERCs be issued only on the basis of energy actually generated or saved, and that only one ERC is issued for each verified MWh.
                (f) Tracking system. Your plan must require that ERCs may only be issued through an ERC tracking system approved as part of the State plan.
                (g) Error adjustment. Your plan must include a mechanism to adjust the number of ERCs issued if any are issued based on error (clerical, formula input error, etc.).
                (h) Qualification status of an eligible resource. Your plan must include a mechanism to temporarily or permanently revoke the qualification status of an eligible resource, such that it can no longer be issued ERCs for at least the duration that it does not meet the requirements for being issued ERCs in your State plan.
                (i) Qualification status of an independent verifier—(1) Eligibility. To be an independent verifier, a person must be approved by the State as:
                (A) An independent verifier, as defined by this regulation; and
                (B) Eligible to verify eligibility applications, EM&V plans, and/or M&V reports per the requirements of the approved State plan as meeting §§ 60.5830 and 60.5835 respectively.
                (2) Revocation of qualification. Your plan must include a mechanism to temporarily or permanently revoke the qualification status of an independent verifier, such that it can no longer verify eligibility applications, EM&V plans or M&V reports for at least the duration of the period it does not meet the requirements of your State plan.
              
              
                § 60.5810
                What applicable requirements are there for an ERC tracking system?
                (a) Your plan must include provisions for an ERC tracking system, if applicable, that meets the following requirements:
                (1) It electronically records the issuance of ERCs, transfers of ERCs among accounts, surrender of ERCs by affected EGUs as part of a compliance demonstration, and retirement or cancellation of ERCs; and
                (2) It documents and provides electronic, internet-based public access to all information that supports the eligibility of eligible resources and issuance of ERCs and functionality to generate reports based on such information, which must include, for each ERC, an eligibility application, EM&V plan, M&V reports, and independent verifier verification reports.
                (b) If approved in a State plan, an ERC tracking system may provide for transfers of ERCs to or from another ERC tracking system approved in a State plan, or provide for transfers of ERCs to or from an EPA-administered ERC tracking system used to administer a Federal plan.
              
            
            
              Mass Allocation Requirements
              
                § 60.5815
                What are the requirements for State allocation of allowances in a mass-based program?

                (a) For a mass-based trading program, a State plan must include requirements for CO2 allowance allocations according to paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
                (b) Provisions for allocation of allowances for each compliance period prior to the beginning of the compliance period.

                (c) Provisions for allocation of set-aside allowance, if applicable, must be established to ensure that the eligible resources must meet the same requirements for the ERC eligible resource requirements of § 60.5800, and the State must include eligibility application and verification provisions equivalent to those for ERCs in § 60.5805 and EM&V plan and M&V report provisions that meet the requirements of §§ 60.5830 and 60.5835.
                

                (d) Provisions for adjusting allocations if the affected EGUs or eligible resources are incorrectly allocated CO2 allowances.
                (e) Provisions allowing for or restricting banking of allowances between compliance periods for affected EGUs.
                (f) Provisions not allowing any borrowing of allowances from future compliance periods by affected EGUs.
              
              
                § 60.5820
                What are my allowance tracking requirements?
                (a) Your plan must include provisions for an allowance tracking system, if applicable, that meets the following requirements:
                (1) It electronically records the issuance of allowances, transfers of allowances among accounts, surrender of allowances by affected EGUs as part of a compliance demonstration, and retirement of allowances; and
                (2) It documents and provides electronic, internet-based public access to all information that supports the eligibility of eligible resources and issuance of set aside allowances, if applicable, and functionality to generate reports based on such information, which must include, for each set aside allowance, an eligibility application, EM&V plan, M&V reports, and independent verifier verification reports.
                (b) If approved in a State plan, an allowance tracking system may provide for transfers of allowances to or from another allowance tracking system approved in a State plan, or provide for transfers of allowances to or from an EPA-administered allowance tracking system used to administer a Federal plan.
              
              
                § 60.5825
                What is the process for affected EGUs to demonstrate compliance in a mass-based program?

                (a) A plan must require an affected EGU's owners or operators to demonstrate compliance with emission standards in a mass based program by holding an amount of allowances not less than the tons of total CO2 emissions for such compliance period from the affected EGUs in the account for the affected EGU's emissions in the allowance tracking system required under § 60.5820 during the applicable compliance period.

                (b) In a mass-based trading program a plan may allow multiple affected EGUs co-located at the same facility to demonstrate that they are meeting the applicable emission standards on a facility-wide basis by the owner or operator holding enough allowances to cover the CO2 emissions of all the affected EGUs at the facility.

                (1) If there are not enough allowances to cover the facility's affected EGUs' CO2 emissions then there must be provisions for determining the compliance status of each affected EGU located at that facility.

                § 60.5830
                What are the requirements for EM&V plans for eligible resources?
                (a) If your plan requires your affected EGUs to meet their emission standards in accordance with § 60.5790, your plan must include requirements that any EM&V plan that is submitted in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5805, in support of the issuance of an ERC or set-aside allowance that can be used in accordance with § 60.5790, must meet the EM&V criteria approved as part of your State plan.
                (b) Your plan must require each EM&V plan to include identification of the eligible resource.
                (c) Your plan must require that an EM&V plan must contain specific criteria, as applicable to the specific eligible resource.
                (1) For RE resources, your plan must include requirements discussing how the generation data will be physically measured on a continuous basis using, for example, a revenue-quality meter.

                (2) For demand-side EE, your plan must require that each EM&V plan quantify and verify electricity savings on a retrospective (ex-post) basis using industry best-practice EM&V protocols and methods that yield accurate and reliable measurements of electricity savings. Your plan must also require each EM&V plan to include an assessment of the independent factors that influence the electricity savings, the expected life of the savings (in years), and a baseline that represents what would have happened in the absence of the demand-side EE activity. Additionally, your plan must require that each EM&V plan include a demonstration of how the industry best-practices protocol and methods were applied to the specific activity, project, measure, or program covered in the EM&V plan, and include an explanation of why these protocols or methods were selected. EM&V plans must require eligible resources to demonstrate how all such best-practice approaches will be applied for the purposes of quantifying and verifying MWh results. Subsequent reporting of demand-side EE savings values must demonstrate and explain how the EM&V plan was followed.
              
              
                § 60.5835
                What are the requirements for M&V reports for eligible resources?
                (a) If your plan requires your affected EGUs to meet their emission standards in accordance with § 60.5790, your plan must include requirements that any M&V report that is submitted in accordance with the requirements of § 60.5805, in support of the issuance of an ERC or set-aside allocation that can be used in accordance with § 60.5790, must meet the requirements of this section.
                (b) Your plan must require that each M&V report include the following:
                (1) For the first M&V report submitted, documentation that the energy-generating resources, energy-saving measures, or practices were installed or implemented consistent with the description in the approved eligibility application required in § 60.5805(a).
                (2) Each M&V report submitted must include the following:
                (i) Identification of the time period covered by the M&V report;
                (ii) A description of how relevant quantification methods, protocols, guidelines, and guidance specified in the EM&V plan were applied during the reporting period to generate the quantified MWh of generation or MWh of energy savings;
                (iii) Documentation (including data) of the energy generation and/or energy savings from any activity, project, measure, resource, or program addressed in the EM&V plan, quantified and verified in MWh for the period covered by the M&V report, in accordance with its EM&V plan, and based on ex-post energy generation or savings; and
                (iv) Documentation of any change in the energy generation or savings capability of the eligible resource from the description of the resource in the approved eligibility application during the period covered by the M&V report and the date on which the change occurred, and/or demonstration that the eligible resource continued to meet the requirements of § 60.5800.

                § 60.5840
                Does this subpart directly affect EGU owners or operators in my State?
                (a) This subpart does not directly affect EGU owners or operators in your State. However, affected EGU owners or operators must comply with the plan that a State or States develop to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
                (b) If a State does not submit a final plan to implement and enforce the emission guidelines contained in this subpart, or an initial submittal for which an extension to submit a final plan can be granted, by September 6, 2016, or the EPA disapproves a final plan, the EPA will implement and enforce a Federal plan, as provided in § 60.5720, applicable to each affected EGU within the State that commenced construction on or before January 8, 2014.
              
              
                § 60.5845
                What affected EGUs must I address in my State plan?
                (a) The EGUs that must be addressed by your plan are any affected steam generating unit, IGCC, or stationary combustion turbine that commenced construction on or before January 8, 2014.

                (b) An affected EGU is a steam generating unit, IGCC, or stationary combustion turbine that meets the relevant applicability conditions specified in paragraph (b)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable, except as provided in § 60.5850.
                

                (1) Serves a generator or generators connected to a utility power distribution system with a nameplate capacity greater than 25 MW-net (i.e., capable of selling greater than 25 MW of electricity);
                (2) Has a base load rating (i.e., design heat input capacity) greater than 260 GJ/hr (250 MMBtu/hr) heat input of fossil fuel (either alone or in combination with any other fuel); and
                (3) Stationary combustion turbines that meet the definition of either a combined cycle or combined heat and power combustion turbine.
              
              
                § 60.5850
                What EGUs are excluded from being affected EGUs?
                EGUs that are excluded from being affected EGUs are:
                (a) EGUs that are subject to subpart TTTT of this part as a result of commencing construction after the subpart TTTT applicability date;
                (b) Steam generating units and IGCCs that are, and always have been, subject to a federally enforceable permit limiting annual net-electric sales to one-third or less of its potential electric output, or 219,000 MWh or less;
                (c) Non-fossil units (i.e., units that are capable of combusting 50 percent or more non-fossil fuel) that have always historically limited the use of fossil fuels to 10 percent or less of the annual capacity factor or are subject to a federally enforceable permit limiting fossil fuel use to 10 percent or less of the annual capacity factor;

                (d) Stationary combustion turbines not capable of combusting natural gas (e.g., not connected to a natural gas pipeline);
                (e) EGUs that are combined heat and power units that have always historically limited, or are subject to a federally enforceable permit limiting, annual net-electric sales to a utility distribution system to no more than the greater of either 219,000 MWh or the product of the design efficiency and the potential electric output;
                (f) EGUs that serve a generator along with other steam generating unit(s), IGCC(s), or stationary combustion turbine(s) where the effective generation capacity (determined based on a prorated output of the base load rating of each steam generating unit, IGCC, or stationary combustion turbine) is 25 MW or less;

                § 60.5855
                What are the CO2 emission performance rates for affected EGUs?

                (a) You must require, in your plan, emission standards on affected EGUs to meet the CO2 emission performance rates listed in table 1 of this subpart except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. In addition, you must set CO2 emission performance rates for the interim steps, according to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
                (1) You must set CO2 emission performance rates for your affected EGUs to meet during the interim step periods on average and as applicable for the two subcategories of affected EGUs.
                (2) [Reserved]

                (b) You may elect to require your affected EGUs to meet emission standards that differ from the CO2 emission performance rates listed in table 1 of this subpart, provided that you demonstrate that the affected EGUs in your State will collectively meet their CO2 emission performance rate by achieving statewide emission goals that are equivalent and no less stringent than the CO2 emission performance rates listed in table 1, and provided that your equivalent statewide CO2 emission goals take one of the following forms:
                (1) Average statewide rate-based CO2 emission goals listed in table 2 of this subpart, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d); or
                (2) Cumulative statewide mass-based CO2 emission goals listed in table 3 of this subpart, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
                (c) If your plan meets CO2 emission goals listed in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section you must develop your own interim step goals and final reporting period goal for your affected EGUs to meet either on average (in the case of rate-based goals) or cumulatively (in the case of mass-based goals). Additionally the following applies if you develop your own goals:
                (1) The interim period and interim steps CO2 emission goals must be in the same form, either both rate (in units of pounds per net MWh) or both mass (in tons); and

                (2) You must set interim step goals that will either on average or cumulatively meet the State's interim period goal, as applicable to a rate-based or mass-based CO2 emission goal.
                (d) Your plan's interim period and final period CO2 emission goals required to be met pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, may be changed in the plan only according to situations listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. If a situation requires a plan revision, you must follow the procedures in § 60.5785 to submit a plan revision.
                (1) If your plan implements CO2 emission goals, you may submit a plan or plan revision, allowed in § 60.5785, to make corrections to them, subject to EPA's approval, as a result of changes in the inventory of affected EGUs; and

                (2) If you elect to require your affected EGUs to meet emission standards to meet mass-based CO2 emission goals in your plan, you may elect to incorporate, as a matter of state law, the mass emissions from EGUs that are subject to subpart TTTT of this part that are considered new affected EGUs under subpart TTTT of this part.
                (e) If your plan relies upon State measures in addition to or in lieu of emission standards, you must only use the mass-based goals allowed for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to demonstrate that your affected EGUs are meeting the required emissions performance.
                (f) Nothing in this subpart precludes an affected EGU from complying with its emission standard or you from meeting your obligations under the State plan.
              
              
                § 60.5860
                What applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements do I need to include in my plan for affected EGUs?
                (a) Your plan must include monitoring for affected EGUs that is no less stringent than what is described in (a)(1) through (8) of this section.

                (1) The owner or operator of an affected EGU (or group of affected EGUs that share a monitored common stack) that is required to meet rate-based or mass-based emission standards must prepare a monitoring plan in accordance with the applicable provisions in § 75.53(g) and (h) of this chapter, unless such a plan is already in place under another program that requires CO2 mass emissions to be monitored and reported according to part 75 of this chapter.

                (2) For rate-based emission standards, each compliance period shall include only “valid operating hours” in the compliance period, i.e., full or partial unit (or stack) operating hours for which:

                (i) “Valid data” (as defined in § 60.5880) are obtained for all of the parameters used to determine the hourly CO2 mass emissions (lbs). For the purposes of this subpart, substitute data recorded under part 75 of this chapter are not considered to be valid data; and

                (ii) The corresponding hourly net energy output value is also valid data (Note: For operating hours with no useful output, zero is considered to be a valid value).

                (3) For rate-based emission standards, the owner or operator of an affected EGU must measure and report the hourly CO2 mass emissions (lbs) from each affected unit using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

                (i) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a CO2 continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) to directly measure and record CO2 concentrations in the affected EGU exhaust gases emitted to the atmosphere and an exhaust gas flow rate monitoring system according to § 75.10(a)(3)(i) of this chapter. As an alternative to direct measurement of CO2 concentration, provided that the affected EGU does not use carbon separation (e.g., carbon capture and storage), the owner or operator of an affected EGU may use data from a certified oxygen (O2) monitor to calculate hourly average CO2 concentrations, in accordance with § 75.10(a)(3)(iii) of this chapter. However, when an O2 monitor is used this way, it only quantifies the combustion CO2; therefore, if the EGU is equipped with emission controls that produce non-combustion CO2 (e.g., from sorbent injection), this additional CO2 must be accounted for, in accordance with section 3 of appendix G to part 75 of this chapter. If CO2 concentration is measured on a dry basis, the owner or operator of the affected EGU must also install, certify, operate, maintain, and calibrate a continuous moisture monitoring system, according to § 75.11(b) of this chapter. Alternatively, the owner or operator of an affected EGU may either use an appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value from § 75.11(b) or submit a petition to the Administrator under § 75.66 of this chapter for a site-specific default moisture value.

                (ii) For each “valid operating hour” (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), calculate the hourly CO2 mass emission rate (tons/hr), either from Equation F-11 in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (if CO2 concentration is measured on a wet basis), or by following the procedure in section 4.2 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter (if CO2 concentration is measured on a dry basis).
                (iii) Next, multiply each hourly CO2 mass emission rate by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), to convert it to tons of CO2. Multiply the result by 2,000 lbs/ton to convert it to lbs.
                (iv) The hourly CO2 tons/hr values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO2 mass emissions are required to be recorded under § 75.57(e) of this chapter and must be reported electronically under § 75.64(a)(6), if required by a plan. The owner or operator must use these data, or equivalent data, to calculate the hourly CO2 mass emissions.
                (v) Sum all of the hourly CO2 mass emissions values from paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section over the entire compliance period.

                (vi) For each continuous monitoring system used to determine the CO2 mass emissions from an affected EGU, the monitoring system must meet the applicable certification and quality assurance procedures in § 75.20 of this chapter and appendices A and B to part 75 of this chapter.

                (4) The owner or operator of an affected EGU that exclusively combusts liquid fuel and/or gaseous fuel may, as an alternative to complying with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, determine the hourly CO2 mass emissions according to paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(vi) of this section.
                (i) Implement the applicable procedures in appendix D to part 75 of this chapter to determine hourly EGU heat input rates (MMBtu/hr), based on hourly measurements of fuel flow rate and periodic determinations of the gross calorific value (GCV) of each fuel combusted. The fuel flow meter(s) used to measure the hourly fuel flow rates must meet the applicable certification and quality-assurance requirements in sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 of appendix D to part 75 (except for qualifying commercial billing meters). The fuel GCV must be determined in accordance with section 2.2 or 2.3 of appendix D, as applicable.

                (ii) For each measured hourly heat input rate, use Equation G-4 in appendix G to part 75 of this chapter to calculate the hourly CO2 mass emission rate (tons/hr).

                (iii) For each “valid operating hour” (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), multiply the hourly tons/hr CO2 mass emission rate from paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section by the EGU or stack operating time in hours (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), to convert it to tons of CO2. Then, multiply the result by 2,000 lbs/ton to convert it to lbs.
                (iv) The hourly CO2 tons/hr values and EGU (or stack) operating times used to calculate CO2 mass emissions are required to be recorded under § 75.57(e) of this chapter and must be reported electronically under § 75.64(a)(6), if required by a plan. You must use these data, or equivalent data, to calculate the hourly CO2 mass emissions.
                (v) Sum all of the hourly CO2 mass emissions values (lb) from paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section over the entire compliance period.

                (vi) The owner or operator of an affected EGU may determine site-specific carbon-based F-factors (Fc) using Equation F-7b in section 3.3.6 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, and may use these Fc values in the emissions calculations instead of using the default Fc values in the Equation G-4 nomenclature.
                (5) For both rate-based and mass-based standards, the owner or operator of an affected EGU (or group of affected units that share a monitored common stack) must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a sufficient number of watt meters to continuously measure and record on an hourly basis net electric output. Measurements must be performed using 0.2 accuracy class electricity metering instrumentation and calibration procedures as specified under ANSI Standards No. C12.20. Further, the owner or operator of an affected EGU that is a combined heat and power facility must install, calibrate, maintain and operate equipment to continuously measure and record on an hourly basis useful thermal output and, if applicable, mechanical output, which are used with net electric output to determine net energy output. The owner or operator must use the following procedures to calculate net energy output, as appropriate for the type of affected EGU(s).
                (i) Determine Pnet the hourly net energy output in MWh. For rate-based standards, perform this calculation only for valid operating hours (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). For mass-based standards, perform this calculation for all unit (or stack) operating hours, i.e., full or partial hours in which any fuel is combusted.
                (ii) If there is no net electrical output, but there is mechanical or useful thermal output, either for a particular valid operating hour (for rate-based applications), or for a particular operating hour (for mass-based applications), the owner or operator of the affected EGU must still determine the net energy output for that hour.
                (iii) For rate-based applications, if there is no (i.e., zero) gross electrical, mechanical, or useful thermal output for a particular valid operating hour, that hour must be used in the compliance determination. For hours or partial hours where the gross electric output is equal to or less than the auxiliary loads, net electric output shall be counted as zero for this calculation.
                (iv) Calculate Pnet for your affected EGU (or group of affected EGUs that share a monitored common stack) using the following equation. All terms in the equation must be expressed in units of MWh. To convert each hourly net energy output value reported under part 75 of this chapter to MWh, multiply by the corresponding EGU or stack operating time.
                
                  ER23OC15.006
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  Pnet = Net energy output of your affected EGU for each valid operating hour (as defined in 60.5860(a)(2)) in MWh.
                  (Pe)ST = Electric energy output plus mechanical energy output (if any) of steam turbines in MWh.
                  (Pe)CT = Electric energy output plus mechanical energy output (if any) of stationary combustion turbine(s) in MWh.
                  (Pe)IE = Electric energy output plus mechanical energy output (if any) of your affected EGU's integrated equipment that provides electricity or mechanical energy to the affected EGU or auxiliary equipment in MWh.
                  (Pe)A = Electric energy used for any auxiliary loads in MWh.
                  (Pt)PS = Useful thermal output of steam (measured relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) that is used for applications that do not generate additional electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU. This is calculated using the equation specified in paragraph (a)(5)(v) of this section in MWh.
                  (Pt)HR = Non-steam useful thermal output (measured relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from heat recovery that is used for applications other than steam generation or performance enhancement of the affected EGU in MWh.
                  (Pt)IE = Useful thermal output (relative to SATP conditions, as applicable) from any integrated equipment is used for applications that do not generate additional steam, electricity, produce mechanical energy output, or enhance the performance of the affected EGU in MWh.
                  TDF = Electric Transmission and Distribution Factor of 0.95 for a combined heat and power affected EGU where at least on an annual basis 20.0 percent of the total gross or net energy output consists of electric or direct mechanical output and 20.0 percent of the total net energy output consist of useful thermal output on a 12-operating month rolling average basis, or 1.0 for all other affected EGUs.
                
                

                (v) If applicable to your affected EGU (for example, for combined heat and power), you must calculate (Pt)PS using the following equation:
                
                  ER23OC15.007
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  Qm = Measured steam flow in kilograms (kg) (or pounds (lbs)) for the operating hour.
                  H = Enthalpy of the steam at measured temperature and pressure (relative to SATP conditions or the energy in the condensate return line, as applicable) in Joules per kilogram (J/kg) (or Btu/lb).
                  CF = Conversion factor of 3.6 x 109 J/MWh or 3.413 x 106 Btu/MWh.
                
                

                (vi) For rate-based standards, sum all of the values of Pnet for the valid operating hours (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), over the entire compliance period. Then, divide the total CO2 mass emissions for the valid operating hours from paragraph (a)(3)(v) or (a)(4)(v) of this section, as applicable, by the sum of the Pnet values for the valid operating hours plus any ERC replacement generation (as shown in § 60.5790(c)), to determine the CO2 emissions rate (lb/net MWh) for the compliance period.

                (vii) For mass-based standards, sum all of the values of Pnet for all operating hours, over the entire compliance period.

                (6) In accordance with § 60.13(g), if two or more affected EGUs implementing the continuous emissions monitoring provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section share a common exhaust gas stack and are subject to the same emissions standard, the owner or operator may monitor the hourly CO2 mass emissions at the common stack in lieu of monitoring each EGU separately. If an owner or operator of an affected EGU chooses this option, the hourly net electric output for the common stack must be the sum of the hourly net electric output of the individual affected EGUs and the operating time must be expressed as “stack operating hours” (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter).

                (7) In accordance with § 60.13(g), if the exhaust gases from an affected EGU implementing the continuous emissions monitoring provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are emitted to the atmosphere through multiple stacks (or if the exhaust gases are routed to a common stack through multiple ducts and you elect to monitor in the ducts), the hourly CO2 mass emissions and the “stack operating time” (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) at each stack or duct must be monitored separately. In this case, the owner or operator of an affected EGU must determine compliance with an applicable emissions standard by summing the CO2 mass emissions measured at the individual stacks or ducts and dividing by the net energy output for the affected EGU.
                (8) Consistent with § 60.5775 or § 60.5780, if two or more affected EGUs serve a common electric generator, you must apportion the combined hourly net energy output to the individual affected EGUs according to the fraction of the total steam load contributed by each EGU. Alternatively, if the EGUs are identical, you may apportion the combined hourly net electrical load to the individual EGUs according to the fraction of the total heat input contributed by each EGU.

                (b) For mass-based standards, the owner or operator of an affected EGU must determine the CO2 mass emissions (tons) for the compliance period as follows:
                

                (1) For each operating hour, calculate the hourly CO2 mass (tons) according to paragraph (a)(3) or (4) of this section, except that a complete data record is required, i.e., CO2 mass emissions must be reported for each operating hour. Therefore, substitute data values recorded under part 75 of this chapter for CO2 concentration, stack gas flow rate, stack gas moisture content, fuel flow rate and/or GCV shall be used in the calculations; and
                (2) Sum all of the hourly CO2 mass emissions values over the entire compliance period.

                (3) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a sufficient number of watt meters to continuously measure and record on an hourly basis net electric output. Measurements must be performed using 0.2 accuracy class electricity metering instrumentation and calibration procedures as specified under ANSI Standards No. C12.20. Further, the owner or operator of an affected EGU that is a combined heat and power facility must install, calibrate, maintain and operate equipment to continuously measure and record on an hourly basis useful thermal output and, if applicable, mechanical output, which are used with net electric output to determine net energy output (Pnet). The owner or operator must calculate net energy output according to paragraphs (a)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
                (c) Your plan must require the owner or operator of each affected EGU covered by your plan to maintain the records, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, for at least 5 years following the date of each compliance period, occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record.
                (1) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must maintain each record on site for at least 2 years after the date of each compliance period, occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record, whichever is latest, according to § 60.7. The owner or operator of an affected EGU may maintain the records off site and electronically for the remaining year(s).
                (2) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must keep all of the following records, in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review:
                (i) All documents, data files, and calculations and methods used to demonstrate compliance with an affected EGU's emission standard under § 60.5775.
                (ii) Copies of all reports submitted to the State under paragraph (c) of this section.
                (iii) Data that are required to be recorded by 40 CFR part 75 subpart F.
                (iv) Data with respect to any ERCs generated by the affected EGU or used by the affected EGU in its compliance demonstration including the information in paragraphs (c)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section.
                (A) All documents related to any ERCs used in a compliance demonstration, including each eligibility application, EM&V plan, M&V report, and independent verifier verification report associated with the issuance of each specific ERC.
                (B) All records and reports relating to the surrender and retirement of ERCs for compliance with this regulation, including the date each individual ERC with a unique serial identification number was surrendered and/or retired.

                (v) The sum of the hourly net energy output values for all of the unit or stack operating hours in the compliance period.

                (vi) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section, if the compliance period is a discrete number of calendar years (e.g., one year, three years), in lieu of reporting the information specified in those paragraphs, the owner or operator may report:
                (A) The cumulative annual CO2 mass emissions (tons) for each year of the compliance period, derived from the electronic emissions report for the fourth calendar quarter of that year, submitted to EPA under § 75.64(a) of this chapter; and
                (B) The sum of the cumulative annual CO2 mass emissions values from paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of this section, if the compliance period includes multiple years.

                (4) For each affected EGU's compliance period, the report must also include the applicable emission standard and demonstration that it met the emission standard. An owner or operator must also include in the report the affected EGU's calculated emission performance as a CO2 emission rate or cumulative mass in units of the emission standard required in §§ 60.5790(b) through (c) and 60.5855, as applicable.
                (5) If the owner or operator of an affected EGU is complying with an emission standard by using ERCs, they must include in the report a list of all unique ERC serial numbers that were retired in the compliance period, and, for each ERC, the date an ERC was surrendered and retired and eligible resource identification information sufficient to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of § 60.5800 and qualifies to be issued ERCs (including location, type of qualifying generation or savings, date commenced generating or saving, and date of generation or savings for which the ERC was issued).
                (6) If the owner or operator of an affected EGU is complying with an emission standard by using allowances, they must include in the report a list of all unique allowance serial numbers that were retired in the compliance period, and, for each allowance, the date an allowance was surrendered and retired and if the allowance was a set-aside allowance the eligible resource identification information sufficient to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of § 60.5815(c) and qualifies to be issued set-aside allowances (including location, type of qualifying generation or savings, date commenced generating or saving, and date of generation or savings for which the allowance was issued).
                (e) The owner or operator of an affected EGU must follow any additional requirements for monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting in a plan that are required under § 60.5745(a)(4), if applicable.
                (f) If an affected EGU captures CO2 to meet the applicable emission limit, the owner or operator must report in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98 subpart PP and either:

                (1) Report in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98 subpart RR, if injection occurs on-site;
                
                (2) Transfer the captured CO2 to an EGU or facility that reports in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 98 subpart RR, if injection occurs off-site; or
                (3) Transfer the captured CO2 to a facility that has received an innovative technology waiver from EPA pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.

                (g) Any person may request the Administrator to issue a waiver of the requirement that captured CO2 from an affected EGU be transferred to a facility reporting under 40 CFR part 98 subpart RR. To receive a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate to the Administrator that its technology will store captured CO2 as effectively as geologic sequestration, and that the proposed technology will not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety. In making this determination, the Administrator shall consider (among other factors) operating history of the technology, whether the technology will increase emissions or other releases of any pollutant other than CO2, and permanence of the CO2 storage. The Administrator may test the system itself, or require the applicant to perform any tests considered by the Administrator to be necessary to show the technology's effectiveness, safety, and ability to store captured CO2 without release. The Administrator may grant conditional approval of a technology, the approval conditioned on monitoring and reporting of operations. The Administrator may also withdraw approval of the waiver on evidence of releases of CO2 or other pollutants. The Administrator will provide notice to the public of any application under this provision, and provide public notice of any proposed action on a petition before the Administrator takes final action.
              
            
            
              Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements
              
                § 60.5865
                What are my recordkeeping requirements?

                (a) You must keep records of all information relied upon in support of any demonstration of plan components, plan requirements, supporting documentation, State measures, and the status of meeting the plan requirements defined in the plan for each interim step and the interim period. After 2029, States must keep records of all information relied upon in support of any continued demonstration that the final CO2 emission performance rates or CO2 emissions goals are being achieved.
                (b) You must keep records of all data submitted by the owner or operator of each affected EGU that is used to determine compliance with each affected EGU emissions standard or requirements in an approved State plan, consistent with the affected EGU requirements listed in § 60.5860.

                (c) If your State has a requirement for all hourly CO2 emissions and net generation information to be used to calculate compliance with an annual emissions standard for affected EGUs, any information that is submitted by the owners or operators of affected EGUs to the EPA electronically pursuant to requirements in Part 75 meets the recordkeeping requirement of this section and you are not required to keep records of information that would be in duplicate of paragraph (b) of this section.

                (d) You must keep records at a minimum for 10 years, for the interim period, and 5 years, for the final period, from the date the record is used to determine compliance with an emissions standard, plan requirement, CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emissions goal. Each record must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review.
              
              
                § 60.5870
                What are my reporting and notification requirements?
                (a) In lieu of the annual report required under § 60.25(e) and (f) of this part, you must report the information in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.

                (b) You must submit a report covering each interim step within the interim period and each of the final 2-calendar year periods due no later than July 1 of the year following the end of the period. The interim period reporting starts with a report covering interim step 1 due no later than July 1, 2025. The final period reports start with a biennial report covering the first final reporting period (which is due by July 1, 2032), a 2-calendar year average of emissions or cumulative sum of emissions used to determine compliance with the final CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal (as applicable). The report must include the information in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.

                (1) The report must include the emissions performance achieved by all affected EGUs during the reporting period, consistent with the plan approach according to § 60.5745(a), and identification of whether each affected EGU is in compliance with its emission standard and whether the collective of all affected EGUs covered by the State are on schedule to meet the applicable CO2 emission performance rate or emission goal during the performance periods and compliance periods, as specified in the plan.
                (2) The report must include a comparison of the CO2 emission performance rate or CO2 emission goal identified in the State plan for the applicable interim step period versus the actual average, cumulative, or adjusted CO2 emission performance (as applicable) achieved by all affected EGUs.

                (i) For interim step 3, you do not need to include a comparison between the applicable interim step 3 CO2 emission performance rate or emission goal; you must only submit the average, cumulative or adjusted CO2 emission performance (as applicable) of your affected EGUs during that period in units of your applicable CO2 emission performance rate or emission goal.
                (ii) [Reserved]
                (3) The report must include all other required information, as specified in your State plan according to § 60.5740(a)(5).
                (4) If applicable, the report must include a program review that your State has conducted that addresses all aspects of the administration of the State plan and overall program, including State evaluations and regulatory decisions regarding eligibility applications for ERC resources and M&V reports (and associated EM&V activities), and State issuance of ERCs. The program review must assess whether the program is being administered properly in accordance with the approved plan, whether reported annual MWh of generation and savings from qualified ERC resources are being properly quantified, verified, and reported in accordance with approved EM&V plans, and whether appropriate records are being maintained. The program review must also address determination of the eligibility of verifiers by the State and the conduct of independent verifiers, including the quality of verifier reviews.
                (c) If your plan relies upon State measures, in lieu of or in addition to emission standards, then you must submit an annual report to the EPA in addition to the reports required under paragraph (b) of this section for the interim period. In the final period, you must submit biennial reports consistent with those required under paragraph (b) of this section. The annual reports in the interim period must be submitted no later than July 1 following the end of each calendar year starting with 2022. The annual and biennial reports must include the information in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section for the preceding year or two years, as applicable.
                (1) You must include in your report the status of implementation of federally enforceable emission standards (if applicable) and State measures.
                (2) You must include information regarding the status of the periodic programmatic milestones to show progress in program implementation. The programmatic milestones with specific dates for achievement must be consistent with the State measures included in the State plan submittal.
                (d) If your plan includes the requirement for emission standards on your affected EGUs, then you must submit a notification, if applicable, in the report required under paragraph (b) of this section to the EPA if your affected EGUs trigger corrective measures as described in § 60.5740(a)(2)(i). If corrective measures are required and were not previously submitted with your state plan, you must follow the requirements in § 60.5785 for revising your plan to implement the corrective measures.

                (e) If your plan relies upon State measures, in lieu of or in addition to emission standards, than you must submit a notification as required under paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.
                (1) You must submit a notification in the report required under paragraph (c) of this section to the EPA if at the end of the calendar year your State did not meet a programmatic milestone included in your plan submittal. This notification must detail the implementation of the backstop required in your plan to be fully in place within 18 months of the due date of the report required in paragraph (b) of this section. In addition, the notification must describe the steps taken by the State to inform the affected EGUs in its State that the backstop has been triggered.
                (2) You must submit a notification in the report required under paragraph (b) of this section to the EPA if you trigger the backstop as described in § 60.5740(a)(3)(i). This notification must detail the steps that will be taken by you to implement the backstop so that it is fully in place within 18 months of the due date of the report required in paragraph (b) of this section. In addition, the notification must describe the steps taken by the State to inform the affected EGUs that the backstop has been triggered.

                (f) You must include in your 2029 report (which is due by July 1, 2030) the calculation of average CO2 emissions rate, cumulative sum of CO2 emissions, or adjusted CO2 emissions rate (as applicable) over the interim period and a comparison of those values to your interim CO2 emission performance rate or emission goal. The calculated value must be in units consistent with the approach you set in your plan for the interim period.
                (g) The notifications listed in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section are required for the reliability safety valve allowed in § 60.5785(e).
                (1) As required under § 60.5785(e), you must submit an initial notification to the appropriate EPA regional office within 48 hours of an unforeseen, emergency situation. The initial notification must:
                (i) Include a full description, to the extent that it is known, of the emergency situation that is being addressed;
                (ii) Identify the affected EGU or EGUs that are required to run to assure reliability; and
                (iii) Specify the modified emission standards at which the identified EGU or EGUs will operate.
                (2) Within 7 days of the initial notification in § 60.5870(g)(1), the State must submit a second notification to the appropriate EPA regional office that documents the initial notification. If the State fails to submit this documentation on a timely basis, the EPA will notify the State, which must then notify the affected EGU(s) that they must operate or resume operations under the original approved State plan emission standards. This notification must include the following:
                (i) A full description of the reliability concern and why an unforeseen, emergency situation that threatens reliability requires the affected EGU or EGUs to operate under modified emission standards from those originally required in the State plan including discussion of why the flexibilities provided under the state's plan are insufficient to address the concern;
                (ii) A description of how the State is coordinating or will coordinate with relevant reliability coordinators and planning authorities to alleviate the problem in an expedited manner;
                (iii) An indication of the maximum time that the State anticipates the affected EGU or EGUs will need to operate in a manner inconsistent with its or their obligations under the State's approved plan;
                (iv) A written concurrence from the relevant reliability coordinator and/or planning authority confirming the existence of the imminent reliability threat and supporting the temporary modification request or an explanation of why this kind of concurrence cannot be provided;
                (v) The modified emission standards or levels that the affected EGU or EGU will be operating at for the remainder of the 90-day period if it has changed from the initial notification; and

                (vi) Information regarding any system-wide or other analysis of the reliability concern conducted by the relevant planning authority, if any.
                
                (3) At least 7 days before the end of the 90-day reliability safety valve period, the State must notify the appropriate EPA regional office that either:
                (i) The reliability concern has been addressed and the affected EGU or EGUs can resume meeting the original emission standards in the State plan approved prior to the short-term modification; or

                (ii) There still is a serious, ongoing reliability issue that necessitates the affected EGU or EGUs to emit beyond the amount allowed under the State plan. In this case, the State must provide a notification to the EPA that it will be submitting a State plan revision according to paragraph § 60.5785(a) of this section to address the reliability issue. The notification must provide the date by which a revised State plan will be submitted to EPA and documentation of the ongoing emergency with a written concurrence from the relevant reliability coordinator and/or planning authority confirming the continuing urgent need for the affected EGU or EGUs to operate beyond the requirements of the State plan and that there is no other reasonable way of addressing the ongoing reliability emergency but for the affected EGU or EGUs to operate under an alternative emission standard than originally approved under the State plan. After the initial 90-day period, any excess emissions beyond what is authorized in the original approved State plan will count against the State's overall CO2 emission goal or emission performance rate for affected EGUs.
              
              
                § 60.5875
                How do I submit information required by these emission guidelines to the EPA?
                (a) You must submit to the EPA the information required by these emission guidelines following the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.

                (b) All negative declarations, State plan submittals, supporting materials that are part of a State plan submittal, any plan revisions, and all State reports required to be submitted to the EPA by the State plan must be reported through EPA's State Plan Electronic Collection System (SPeCS). SPeCS is a web accessible electronic system accessed at the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (http://www.epa.gov/cdx/). States who claim that a State plan submittal or supporting documentation includes confidential business information (CBI) must submit that information on a compact disc, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: State and Local Programs Group, MD C539-01, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703.
                (c) Only a submittal by the Governor or the Governor's designee by an electronic submission through SPeCS shall be considered an official submittal to the EPA under this subpart. If the Governor wishes to designate another responsible official the authority to submit a State plan, the EPA must be notified via letter from the Governor prior to the September 6, 2016, deadline for plan submittal so that the official will have the ability to submit the initial or final plan submittal in the SPeCS. If the Governor has previously delegated authority to make CAA submittals on the Governor's behalf, a State may submit documentation of the delegation in lieu of a letter from the Governor. The letter or documentation must identify the designee to whom authority is being designated and must include the name and contact information for the designee and also identify the State plan preparers who will need access to SPeCS. A State may also submit the names of the State plan preparers via a separate letter prior to the designation letter from the Governor in order to expedite the State plan administrative process. Required contact information for the designee and preparers includes the person's title, organization and email address.

                (d) The submission of the information by the authorized official must be in a non-editable format. In addition to the non-editable version all plan components designated as federally enforceable must also be submitted in an editable version. Following initial plan approval, States must provide the EPA with an editable copy of any submitted revision to existing approved federally enforceable plan components, including State plan backstop measures. The editable copy of any such submitted plan revision must indicate the changes made at the State level, if any, to the existing approved federally enforceable plan components, using a mechanism such as redline/strikethrough. These changes are not part of the State plan until formal approval by EPA.
                (e) You must provide the EPA with non-editable and editable copies of any submitted revision to existing approved federally enforceable plan components, including State plan backstop measures. The editable copy of any such submitted plan revision must indicate the changes made at the State level, if any, to the existing approved federally enforceable plan components, using a mechanism such as redline/strikethrough. These changes are not part of the State plan until formal approval by EPA.
