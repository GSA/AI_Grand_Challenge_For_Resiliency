      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2018), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

            § 401.10
            Scope and purpose.
            Regulations promulgated or proposed under parts 402 through 699 of this subchapter prescribe effluent limitations guidelines for existing sources, standards of performance for new sources and pretreatment standards for new and existing sources pursuant to sections 301, 304 (b) and (c), 306 (b) and (c), 307 (b) and (c) and 316(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (the “Act”), 33 U.S.C. 1251, 1311, 1314 (b) and (c), 1316 (b) and (c), 1317 (b) and (c) and 1326(b); 86 Stat. 816; Pub. L. 92-500. Point sources of discharges of pollutants are required to comply with these regulations, where applicable, and permits issued by States or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) established pursuant to section 402 of the Act must be conditioned upon compliance with applicable requirements of sections 301 and 306 (as well as certain other requirements). This part 401 sets forth the legal authority and general definitions which will apply to all regulations issued concerning specific classes and categories of point sources under parts 402 through 699 of this subchapter which follow. In certain instances the regulations applicable to a particular point source category or subcategory will contain more specialized definitions. Except as provided in § 401.17, in the case of any conflict between regulations issued under this part 401 and regulations issued under parts 402 through 499 of this subchapter, the latter more specific regulations shall apply.
            (Secs. 301, 304, 306 and 501 of the Clean Water Act (the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et. seq., as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-217))

            (e) The term new source means any building, structure, facility or installation from which there is or may be the discharge of pollutants, the construction of which is commenced after the publication of proposed regulations prescribing a standard of performance under section 306 of the Act which will be applicable to such source if such standard is thereafter promulgated in accordance with section 306 of the Act.
            (f) The term pollutant means dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial, municipal and agricultural waste discharged into water. It does not mean (1) sewage from vessels or (2) water, gas or other material which is injected into a well to facilitate production of oil or gas, or water derived in association with oil or gas production and disposed of in a well, if the well, used either to facilitate production or for disposal purposes, is approved by authority of the State in which the well is located, and if such State determines that such injection or disposal will not result in degradation of ground or surface water resources.
            (g) The term pollution means the man-made or man induced alteration of the chemical, physical, biological and radiological integrity of water.
            (h) The term discharge of pollutant(s) means: (1) The addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source and (2) any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source, other than from a vessel or other floating craft. The term “discharge” includes either the discharge of a single pollutant or the discharge of multiple pollutants.
            (i) The term effluent limitation means any restriction established by the Administrator on quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological and other constituents which are discharged from point sources, other than new sources, into navigable waters, the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean.
            (j) The term effluent limitations guidelines means any effluent limitations guidelines issued by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(b) of the Act.
            (k) The term standard of performance means any restriction established by the Administrator pursuant to section 306 of the Act on quantities, rates, and concentrations of chemical, physical, biological, and other constituents which are or may be discharged from new sources into navigable waters, the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean.
            (l) The term navigable waters means the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.

            (1) For purposes of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. and its implementing regulations, subject to the exclusions in paragraph (l)(2) of this section, the term “waters of the United States” means:
            (i) All waters which are currently used, were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce, including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide;
            (ii) All interstate waters, including interstate wetlands;
            (iii) The territorial seas;
            (iv) All impoundments of waters otherwise identified as waters of the United States under this section;
            (v) All tributaries, as defined in paragraph (l)(3)(iii) of this section, of waters identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section;
            (vi) All waters adjacent to a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, including wetlands, ponds, lakes, oxbows, impoundments, and similar waters;
            (vii) All waters in paragraphs (l)(1)(vii)(A) through (E) of this section where they are determined, on a case-specific basis, to have a significant nexus to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this section. The waters identified in each of paragraphs (l)(1)(vii)(A) through (E) of this section are similarly situated and shall be combined, for purposes of a significant nexus analysis, in the watershed that drains to the nearest water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. Waters identified in this paragraph shall not be combined with waters identified in paragraph (l)(1)(vi) of this section when performing a significant nexus analysis. If waters identified in this paragraph are also an adjacent water under paragraph (l)(1)(vi), they are an adjacent water and no case-specific significant nexus analysis is required.
            (A) Prairie potholes. Prairie potholes are a complex of glacially formed wetlands, usually occurring in depressions that lack permanent natural outlets, located in the upper Midwest.
            (B) Carolina bays and Delmarva bays. Carolina bays and Delmarva bays are ponded, depressional wetlands that occur along the Atlantic coastal plain.
            (C) Pocosins. Pocosins are evergreen shrub and tree dominated wetlands found predominantly along the Central Atlantic coastal plain.
            (D) Western vernal pools. Western vernal pools are seasonal wetlands located in parts of California and associated with topographic depression, soils with poor drainage, mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.
            (E) Texas coastal prairie wetlands. Texas coastal prairie wetlands are freshwater wetlands that occur as a mosaic of depressions, ridges, intermound flats, and mima mound wetlands located along the Texas Gulf Coast.
            (viii) All waters located within the 100-year floodplain of a water identified in (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section and all waters located within 4,000 feet of the high tide line or ordinary high water mark of a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (v) of this section where they are determined on a case-specific basis to have a significant nexus to a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. For waters determined to have a significant nexus, the entire water is a water of the United States if a portion is located within the 100-year floodplain of a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section or within 4,000 feet of the high tide line or ordinary high water mark. Waters identified in this paragraph shall not be combined with waters identified in paragraph (l)(1)(vi) of this section when performing a significant nexus analysis. If waters identified in this paragraph are also an adjacent water under paragraph (l)(1)(vi), they are an adjacent water and no case-specific significant nexus analysis is required.
            (2) The following are not “waters of the United States” even where they otherwise meet the terms of paragraphs (l)(1)(iv) through (viii) of this section.
            (i) Prior converted cropland. Notwithstanding the determination of an area's status as prior converted cropland by any other Federal agency, for the purposes of the Clean Water Act, the final authority regarding Clean Water Act jurisdiction remains with EPA.
            (ii) The following ditches:
            (A) Ditches with ephemeral flow that are not a relocated tributary or excavated in a tributary.
            (B) Ditches with intermittent flow that are not a relocated tributary, excavated in a tributary, or drain wetlands.
            (C) Ditches that do not flow, either directly or through another water, into a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
            (iii) The following features:
            (A) Artificially irrigated areas that would revert to dry land should application of water to that area cease;
            (B) Artificial, constructed lakes and ponds created in dry land such as farm and stock watering ponds, irrigation ponds, settling basins, fields flooded for rice growing, log cleaning ponds, or cooling ponds;
            (C) Artificial reflecting pools or swimming pools created in dry land;
            (D) Small ornamental waters created in dry land;
            (E) Water-filled depressions created in dry land incidental to mining or construction activity, including pits excavated for obtaining fill, sand, or gravel that fill with water;
            (F) Erosional features, including gullies, rills, and other ephemeral features that do not meet the definition of tributary, non-wetland swales, and lawfully constructed grassed waterways; and

            (3) In this paragraph (l), the following terms apply:
            (i) Adjacent. The term adjacent means bordering, contiguous, or neighboring a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, including waters separated by constructed dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, and the like. For purposes of adjacency, an open water such as a pond or lake includes any wetlands within or abutting its ordinary high water mark. Adjacency is not limited to waters located laterally to a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. Adjacent waters also include all waters that connect segments of a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (v) or are located at the head of a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (v) of this section and are bordering, contiguous, or neighboring such water. Waters being used for established normal farming, ranching, and silviculture activities (33 U.S.C. 1344(f)) are not adjacent.
            (ii) Neighboring. The term neighboring means:
            (A) All waters located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark;
            (B) All waters located within the 100-year floodplain of a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (v) of this section and not more than 1,500 feet from the ordinary high water mark of such water. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark and within the 100-year floodplain;
            (C) All waters located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line of a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section, and all waters within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line or within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes.
            (iii) Tributary and tributaries. The terms tributary and tributaries each mean a water that contributes flow, either directly or through another water (including an impoundment identified in paragraph (l)(1)(iv) of this section), to a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section that is characterized by the presence of the physical indicators of a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark. These physical indicators demonstrate there is volume, frequency, and duration of flow sufficient to create a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark, and thus to qualify as a tributary. A tributary can be a natural, man-altered, or man-made water and includes waters such as rivers, streams, canals, and ditches not excluded under paragraph (l)(2) of this section. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if, for any length, there are one or more constructed breaks (such as bridges, culverts, pipes, or dams), or one or more natural breaks (such as wetlands along the run of a stream, debris piles, boulder fields, or a stream that flows underground) so long as a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark can be identified upstream of the break. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if it contributes flow through a water of the United States that does not meet the definition of tributary or through a non-jurisdictional water to a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
            (iv) Wetlands. The term wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
            (v) Significant nexus. The term significant nexus means that a water, including wetlands, either alone or in combination with other similarly situated waters in the region, significantly affects the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. The term “in the region” means the watershed that drains to the nearest water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. For an effect to be significant, it must be more than speculative or insubstantial. Waters are similarly situated when they function alike and are sufficiently close to function together in affecting downstream waters. For purposes of determining whether or not a water has a significant nexus, the water's effect on downstream (1)(i) through (iii) waters shall be assessed by evaluating the aquatic functions identified in paragraphs (l)(3)(v)(A) through (I) of this section. A water has a significant nexus when any single function or combination of functions performed by the water, alone or together with similarly situated waters in the region, contributes significantly to the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of the nearest water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. Functions relevant to the significant nexus evaluation are the following:
            (A) Sediment trapping,
            (B) Nutrient recycling,
            (C) Pollutant trapping, transformation, filtering, and transport,
            (D) Retention and attenuation of flood waters,
            (E) Runoff storage,
            (F) Contribution of flow,
            (G) Export of organic matter,
            (H) Export of food resources, and
            (I) Provision of life cycle dependent aquatic habitat (such as foraging, feeding, nesting, breeding, spawning, or use as a nursery area) for species located in a water identified in paragraphs (l)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
            (vi) Ordinary high water mark. The term ordinary high water mark means that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.
            (vii) High tide line. The term high tide line means the line of intersection of the land with the water's surface at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high tide line may be determined, in the absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and other high tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds such as those accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm.
            (4) Applicability date. This paragraph (l) is applicable beginning on February 6, 2020.
            (m) The terms state water pollution control agency, interstate agency, State, municipality, person, territorial seas, contiguous zone, biological monitoring, schedule of compliance, and industrial user shall be defined in accordance with section 502 of the Act unless the context otherwise requires.
            (n) The term noncontract cooling water means water used for cooling which does not come into direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, waste product or finished product.
            (o) The term noncontact cooling water pollutants means pollutants present in noncontact cooling waters.
            (p) The term blowdown means the minimum discharge of recirculating water for the purpose of discharging materials contained in the water, the further buildup of which would cause concentration in amounts exceeding limits established by best engineering practice.
            (q) The term process waste water means any water which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product, or waste product.
            (r) The term process waste water pollutants means pollutants present in process waste water.
            (s) The following abbreviations shall have the following meanings:
            (1) BOD5 means five-day biochemical oxygen demand;
            (2) COD means chemical oxygen demand;
            (3) TOC means total organic carbon;

            § 401.12
            Law authorizing establishment of effluent limitations guidelines for existing sources, standards of performance for new sources and pretreatment standards of new and existing sources.
            (a) Section 301(a) of the Act provides that “except as in compliance with this section and sections 302, 306, 307, 318, 402 and 404 of this Act, the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.”
            (b) Section 301(b) of the Act requires the achievement by not later than July 1, 1977, of effluent limitations for point sources, other than publicly owned treatment works, which require the application of the best practicable control technology currently available as determined by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(b)(1) of the Act. Section 301(b) also requires the achievement by not later than July 1, 1983, of effluent limitations for point sources, other than publicly owned treatment works, which require the application of the best available technology economically achievable which will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants, as determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(b)(2) of the Act.
            (c) Section 304(b) of the Act requires the Administrator to publish regulations providing guidelines for effluent limitations setting forth the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the application of the best practicable control technology currently available and the degree of effluent reduction attainable through the application of the best control measures and practices achievable including treatment techniques, process and procedure innovations, operating methods and other alternatives.
            (d) Section 304(c) of the Act requires the Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Federal and State agencies and other interested persons to issue information on the process, procedures, or operating methods which result in the elimination or reduction of the discharge of pollutants to implement standards of performance under section 306 of the Act.
            (e) Section 306(b)(1)(B) of the Act requires the Administrator, after a category of sources is included in a list published pursuant to section 306(b)(1)(A) of the Act, to propose regulations establishing Federal standards of performances for new sources within such category. Standards of performance are to provide for the control of the discharge of pollutants which reflect the greatest degree of effluent reduction which the Administrator determines to be achievable through application of the best available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods, or other alternatives, including, where practicable, a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants.
            (f) Section 307(b) provides that the Administrator shall establish pretreatment standards which shall prevent the discharge of any pollutant into publicly owned treatment works which pollutant interferes with, passes through untreated, or otherwise is incompatible with such works.

            (g) Section 307(c) of the Act provides that the Administrator shall promulgate pretreatment standards for sources which would be “new sources” under section 306 (if they were to discharge pollutants directly to navigable waters) at the same time standards of performance for the equivalent category of new sources are promulgated.
            (h) Section 316(b) of the Act provides that any standard established pursuant to section 301 or section 306 of the Act and applicable to a point source shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.
            (i) Section 402(a)(1) of the Act provides that the Administrator may issue permits for the discharge of any pollutant upon condition that such discharge will meet all applicable requirements under sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308 and 403 of this Act. In addition, section 402(b)(1)(A) of the Act requires that permits issued by States under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) established by the Act must apply, and insure compliance with any applicable requirements of sections 301, 302, 306, 307 and 403 of the Act.
          
          
            § 401.13
            Test procedures for measurement.
            The test procedures for measurement which are prescribed at part 136 of this chapter shall apply to expressions of pollutant amounts, characteristics or properties in effluent limitations guidelines and standards of performance and pretreatment standards as set forth at parts 402 through 699 of this subchapter, unless otherwise specifically noted or defined in said parts.
          
          
            § 401.14
            Cooling water intake structures.
            The location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures of any point source for which a standard is established pursuant to section 301 or 306 of the Act shall reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact, in accordance with the provisions of part 402 of this chapter.

            (r) The term POTW Treatment Plant means that portion of the POTW which is designed to provide treatment (including recycling and reclamation) of municipal sewage and industrial waste.
            (s) The term Pretreatment means the reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in wastewater prior to or in lieu of discharging or otherwise introducing such pollutants into a POTW. The reduction or alteration may be obtained by physical, chemical or biological processes, process changes or by other means, except as prohibited by § 403.6(d). Appropriate pretreatment technology includes control equipment, such as equalization tanks or facilities, for protection against surges or slug loadings that might interfere with or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW. However, where wastewater from a regulated process is mixed in an equalization facility with unregulated wastewater or with wastewater from another regulated process, the effluent from the equalization facility must meet an adjusted pretreatment limit calculated in accordance with § 403.6(e).
            (t) The term Pretreatment requirements means any substantive or procedural requirement related to Pretreatment, other than a National Pretreatment Standard, imposed on an Industrial User.
            (u) The term Regional Administrator means the appropriate EPA Regional Administrator.
            (v) Significant Industrial User. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (v)(2) and (v)(3) of this section, the term Significant Industrial User means:

            (ii) Any other Industrial User that: discharges an average of 25,000 gallons per day or more of process wastewater to the POTW (excluding sanitary, noncontact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater); contributes a process wastestream which makes up 5 percent or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW Treatment plant; or is designated as such by the Control Authority on the basis that the Industrial User has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any Pretreatment Standard or requirement (in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6)).
            (2) The Control Authority may determine that an Industrial User subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards under § 403.6 and 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N is a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User rather than a Significant Industrial User on a finding that the Industrial User never discharges more than 100 gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in the Pretreatment Standard) and the following conditions are met:
            (i) The Industrial User, prior to the Control Authority's finding, has consistently complied with all applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards and Requirements;
            (ii) The Industrial User annually submits the certification statement required in § 403.12(q) together with any additional information necessary to support the certification statement; and
            (iii) The Industrial User never discharges any untreated concentrated wastewater.
            (3) Upon a finding that an Industrial User meeting the criteria in paragraph (v)(1)(ii) of this section has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any Pretreatment Standards or requirement, the Control Authority may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an Industrial User or POTW, and in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that such Industrial User is not a Significant Industrial User.
            (w) The term Submission means:
            (1) A request by a POTW for approval of a Pretreatment Program to the EPA or a Director;
            (2) A request by a POTW to the EPA or a Director for authority to revise the discharge limits in categorical Pretreatment Standards to reflect POTW pollutant removals; or
            (3) A request to the EPA by an NPDES State for approval of its State pretreatment program.

            § 403.4
            State or local law.
            Nothing in this regulation is intended to affect any Pretreatment Requirements, including any standards or prohibitions, established by State or local law as long as the State or local requirements are not less stringent than any set forth in National Pretreatment Standards, or any other requirements or prohibitions established under the Act or this regulation. States with an NPDES permit program approved in accordance with section 402 (b) and (c) of the Act, or States requesting NPDES programs, are responsible for developing a State pretreatment program in accordance with § 403.10 of this regulation.
          
          
            § 403.5
            National pretreatment standards: Prohibited discharges.
            (a)(1) General prohibitions. A User may not introduce into a POTW any pollutant(s) which cause Pass Through or Interference. These general prohibitions and the specific prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section apply to each User introducing pollutants into a POTW whether or not the User is subject to other National Pretreatment Standards or any national, State, or local Pretreatment Requirements.
            (2) Affirmative Defenses. A User shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the general prohibitions established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the specific prohibitions in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(6), and (b)(7) of this section where the User can demonstrate that:

            (i) It did not know or have reason to know that its Discharge, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference; and
            
            (ii)(A) A local limit designed to prevent Pass Through and/or Interference, as the case may be, was developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for each pollutant in the User's Discharge that caused Pass Through or Interference, and the User was in compliance with each such local limit directly prior to and during the Pass Through or Interference; or
            (B) If a local limit designed to prevent Pass Through and/or Interference, as the case may be, has not been developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for the pollutant(s) that caused the Pass Through or Interference, the User's Discharge directly prior to and during the Pass Through or Interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge activity when the POTW was regularly in compliance with the POTW's NPDES permit requirements and, in the case of Interference, applicable requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal.
            (b) Specific prohibitions. In addition, the following pollutants shall not be introduced into a POTW:
            (1) Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
            (2) Pollutants which will cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW, but in no case Discharges with pH lower than 5.0, unless the works is specifically designed to accommodate such Discharges;
            (3) Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in Interference;
            (4) Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a Discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause Interference with the POTW.
            (5) Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in Interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW Treatment Plant exceeds 40 °C (104 °F) unless the Approval Authority, upon request of the POTW, approves alternate temperature limits.
            (6) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through;
            (7) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems;
            (8) Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW.
            (c) When specific limits must be developed by POTW. (1) Each POTW developing a POTW Pretreatment Program pursuant to § 403.8 shall develop and enforce specific limits to implement the prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of this section. Each POTW with an approved pretreatment program shall continue to develop these limits as necessary and effectively enforce such limits.
            (2) All other POTW's shall, in cases where pollutants contributed by User(s) result in Interference or Pass-Through, and such violation is likely to recur, develop and enforce specific effluent limits for Industrial User(s), and all other users, as appropriate, which, together with appropriate changes in the POTW Treatment Plant's facilities or operation, are necessary to ensure renewed and continued compliance with the POTW's NPDES permit or sludge use or disposal practices.
            (3) Specific effluent limits shall not be developed and enforced without individual notice to persons or groups who have requested such notice and an opportunity to respond.
            (4) POTWs may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs) to implement paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. Such BMPs shall be considered local limits and Pretreatment Standards for the purposes of this part and section 307(d) of the Act.
            (d) Local limits. Where specific prohibitions or limits on pollutants or pollutant parameters are developed by a POTW in accordance with paragraph (c) above, such limits shall be deemed Pretreatment Standards for the purposes of section 307(d) of the Act.
            
            (e) EPA enforcement actions under section 309(f) of the Clean Water Act.
            If, within 30 days after notice of an Interference or Pass Through violation has been sent by EPA to the POTW, and to persons or groups who have requested such notice, the POTW fails to commence appropriate enforcement action to correct the violation, EPA may take appropriate enforcement action under the authority provided in section 309(f) of the Clean Water Act.

            § 403.6
            National pretreatment standards: Categorical standards.
            National pretreatment standards specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged to a POTW by existing or new industrial users in specific industrial subcategories will be established as separate regulations under the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N. These standards, unless specifically noted otherwise, shall be in addition to all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in this part.
            (a) Category determination request—(1) Application deadline. Within 60 days after the effective date of a Pretreatment Standard for a subcategory under which an Industrial User may be included, the Industrial User or POTW may request that the Water Management Division Director or Director, as appropriate, provide written certification on whether the Industrial User falls within that particular subcategory. If an existing Industrial User adds or changes a process or operation which may be included in a subcategory, the existing Industrial User must request this certification prior to commencing discharge from the added or changed processes or operation. A New Source must request this certification prior to commencing discharge. Where a request for certification is submitted by a POTW, the POTW shall notify any affected Industrial User of such submission. The Industrial User may provide written comments on the POTW submission to the Water Management Division Director or Director, as appropriate, within 30 days of notification.
            (2) Contents of application. Each request shall contain a statement:
            (i) Describing which subcategories might be applicable; and

            (ii) Citing evidence and reasons why a particular subcategory is applicable and why others are not applicable. Any person signing the application statement submitted pursuant to this section shall make the following certification:
            
            
              I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.
            
            
            (3) Deficient requests. The Water Management Division Director or Director will only act on written requests for determinations that contain all of the information required. Persons who have made incomplete submissions will be notified by the Water Management Division Director or Director that their requests are deficient and, unless the time period is extended, will be given 30 days to correct the deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within 30 days or within an extended period allowed by the Water Management Division Director or the Director, the request for a determination shall be denied.
            (4) Final decision. (i) When the Water Management Division Director or Director receives a submittal he or she will, after determining that it contains all of the information required by paragraph (2) of this section, consider the submission, any additional evidence that may have been requested, and any other available information relevant to the request. The Water Management Division Director or Director will then make a written determination of the applicable subcategory and state the reasons for the determination.
            
            (ii) Where the request is submitted to the Director, the Director shall forward the determination described in this paragraph to the Water Management Division Director who may make a final determination. The Water Management Division Director may waive receipt of these determinations. If the Water Management Division Director does not modify the Director's decision within 60 days after receipt thereof, or if the Water Management Division Director waives receipt of the determination, the Director's decision is final.
            (iii) Where the request is submitted by the Industrial User or POTW to the Water Management Division Director or where the Water Management Division Director elects to modify the Director's decision, the Water Management Division Director's decision will be final.
            (iv) The Water Management Division Director or Director, as appropriate, shall send a copy of the determination to the affected Industrial User and the POTW. Where the final determination is made by the Water Management Division Director, he or she shall send a copy of the determination to the Director.
            (5) Requests for hearing and/or legal decision. Within 30 days following the date of receipt of notice of the final determination as provided for by paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, the Requester may submit a petition to reconsider or contest the decision to the Regional Administrator who shall act on such petition expeditiously and state the reasons for his or her determination in writing.
            (b) Deadline for compliance with categorical standards. Compliance by existing sources with categorical Pretreatment Standards shall be within 3 years of the date the Standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N. Direct dischargers with NPDES Permits modified or reissued to provide a variance pursuant to section 301(i)(2) of the Act shall be required to meet compliance dates set in any applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. Existing sources which become Industrial Users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard shall be considered existing Industrial Users except where such sources meet the definition of a New Source as defined in § 403.3(m). New Sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall “start-up” all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards before beginning to Discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), New Sources must meet all applicable Pretreatment Standards.
            (c)(1) Concentration and mass limits. Pollutant discharge limits in categorical Pretreatment Standards will be expressed either as concentration or mass limits. Wherever possible, where concentration limits are specified in standards, equivalent mass limits will be provided so that local, State or Federal authorities responsible for enforcement may use either concentration or mass limits. Limits in categorical Pretreatment Standards shall apply to the effluent of the process regulated by the Standard, or as otherwise specified by the standard.
            (2) When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Control Authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users.
            (3) A Control Authority calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the Standard by the Industrial User's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the Industrial User's actual long-term daily production, such as the average daily production during a representative year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production.

            (4) A Control Authority calculating equivalent concentration limitations under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations derived under paragraph (c)(3) of this section by the average daily flow rate of the Industrial User's regulated process wastewater. This average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the Industrial User's actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year.
            (5) When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the Control Authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Control Authority. The Control Authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial User meets all the following conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) through (c)(5)(i)(E) of this section.
            (i) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User must:
            (A) Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its control mechanism;
            (B) Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
            (C) Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
            (D) Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the Discharge; and
            (E) Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User's request for equivalent mass limits.
            (ii) An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must:
            (A) Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
            (B) Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
            (C) Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the Control Authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Control Authority must reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
            (D) Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
            (iii) A Control Authority which chooses to establish equivalent mass limits:
            (A) Must calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the Industrial User by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average Standard for the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor;
            (B) Upon notification of a revised production rate, must reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and

            (C) May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the Industrial User's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The Industrial User must also be in compliance with § 403.17 (regarding the prohibition of bypass).
            
            (iv) The Control Authority may not express limits in terms of mass for pollutants such as pH, temperature, radiation, or other pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass.
            (6) The Control Authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical Pretreatment Standards at 40 CFR parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users under the following conditions. When converting such limits to concentration limits, the Control Authority must use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 CFR parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by paragraph (d) of this section.
            (7) Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section are deemed Pretreatment Standards for the purposes of section 307(d) of the Act and this part. The Control Authority must document how the equivalent limits were derived and make this information publicly available. Once incorporated into its control mechanism, the Industrial User must comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
            (8) Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
            (9) Any Industrial User operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based standard shall notify the Control Authority within two (2) business days after the User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying the Control Authority of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its control mechanism that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate.
            (d) Dilution prohibited as substitute for treatment. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, no Industrial User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a Discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The Control Authority may impose mass limitations on Industrial Users which are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
            (e) Combined wastestream formula. Where process effluent is mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived by the Control Authority or by the Industrial User with the written concurrence of the Control Authority. These alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed effluent. When deriving alternative categorical limits, the Control Authority or Industrial User shall calculate both an alternative daily maximum value using the daily maximum value(s) specified in the appropriate categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) and an alternative consecutive sampling day average value using the monthly average value(s) specified in the appropriate categorical Pretreatment Standard(s). The Industrial User shall comply with the alternative daily maximum and monthly average limits fixed by the Control Authority until the Control Authority modifies the limits or approves an Industrial User modification request. Modification is authorized whenever there is a material or significant change in the values used in the calculation to fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant. An Industrial User must immediately report any such material or significant change to the Control Authority. Where appropriate new alternative categorical limits shall be calculated within 30 days.
            
            (1) Alternative limit calculation. For purposes of these formulas, the “average daily flow” means a reasonable measure of the average daily flow for a 30-day period. For new sources, flows shall be estimated using projected values. The alternative limit for a specified pollutant will be derived by the use of either of the following formulas:
            (i) Alternative concentration limit.
            
            
              EC15NO91.012
            
            
              where
              
              CT = the alternative concentration limit for the combined wastestream.
              Ci = the categorical Pretreatment Standard concentration limit for a pollutant in the regulated stream i.
              Fi = the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) of stream i to the extent that it is regulated for such pollutant.
              FD = the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) from: (a) Boiler blowdown streams, non-contact cooling streams, stormwater streams, and demineralizer backwash streams; provided, however, that where such streams contain a significant amount of a pollutant, and the combination of such streams, prior to treatment, with an Industrial User's regulated process wastestream(s) will result in a substantial reduction of that pollutant, the Control Authority, upon application of the Industrial User, may exercise its discretion to determine whether such stream(s) should be classified as diluted or unregulated. In its application to the Control Authority, the Industrial User must provide engineering, production, sampling and analysis and such other information so that the Control Authority can make its determination; or (b) sanitary wastestreams where such streams are not regulated by a Categorical Pretreatment Standard; or (c) from any process wastestreams which were or could have been entirely exempted from categorical Pretreatment Standards pursuant to paragraph 8 of the NRDC v. Costle Consent Decree (12 ERC 1833) for one or more of the following reasons (see appendix D of this part):
              (1) The pollutants of concern are not detectable in the effluent from the Industrial User (paragraph (8)(a)(iii));
              (2) The pollutants of concern are present only in trace amounts and are neither causing nor likely to cause toxic effects (paragraph (8)(a)(iii));
              (3) The pollutants of concern are present in amounts too small to be effectively reduced by technologies known to the Administrator (paragraph (8)(a)(iii)); or
              (4) The wastestream contains only pollutants which are compatible with the POTW (paragraph (8)(b)(i)).
              FT = The average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) through the combined treatment facility (includes Fi, FD and unregulated streams).
              N = The total number of regulated streams.
            
            
            (ii) Alternative mass limit.
            
            
              EC15NO91.013
            
            
              where
              
              MT = the alternative mass limit for a pollutant in the combined wastestream.
              Mi = the categorical Pretreatment Standard mass limit for a pollutant in the regulated stream i (the categorical pretreatment mass limit multiplied by the appropriate measure of production).
              Fi = the average flow (at least a 30-day average) of stream i to the extent that it is regulated for such pollutant.
              FD=the average daily flow (at least a 30-day average) from: (a) Boiler blowdown streams, non-contact cooling streams, stormwater streams, and demineralizer backwash streams; provided, however, that where such streams contain a significant amount of a pollutant, and the combination of such streams, prior to treatment, with an Industrial User's regulated process wastestream(s) will result in a substantial reduction of that pollutant, the Control Authority, upon application of the Industrial User, may exercise its discretion to determine whether such stream(s) should be classified as diluted or unregulated. In its application to the Control Authority, the Industrial User must provide engineering, production, sampling and analysis and such other information so that the Control Authority can make its determination; or (b) sanitary wastestreams where such streams are not regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard; or (c) from any process wastestreams which were or could have been entirely exempted from categorical Pretreatment Standards pursuant to paragraph 8 of the NRDC v. Costle Consent Decree (12 ERC 1833) for one or more of the following reasons (see appendix D of this part):
              (1) The pollutants of concern are not detectable in the effluent from the Industrial User (paragraph (8)(a)(iii));
              (2) The pollutants of concern are present only in trace amounts and are neither causing nor likely to cause toxic effects (paragraph (8)(a)(iii));
              (3) The pollutants of concern are present in amounts too small to be effectively reduced by technologies known to the Administrator (paragraph (8)(a)(iii)); or
              (4) The wastestream contains only pollutants which are compatible with the POTW (paragraph (8)(b)(i)).
              FT = The average flow (at least a 30-day average) through the combined treatment facility (includes Fi, FD and unregulated streams).
              N = The total number of regulated streams.
            
            
            (2) Alternate limits below detection limit. An alternative pretreatment limit may not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants.
            (3) Self-monitoring. Self-monitoring required to insure compliance with the alternative categorical limit shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of § 403.12(g).
            (4) Choice of monitoring location. Where a treated regulated process wastestream is combined prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, the Industrial User may monitor either the segregated process wastestream or the combined wastestream for the purpose of determining compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards. If the Industrial User chooses to monitor the segregated process wastestream, it shall apply the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If the User chooses to monitor the combined wastestream, it shall apply an alternative discharge limit calculated using the combined wastestream formula as provided in this section. The Industrial User may change monitoring points only after receiving approval from the Control Authority. The Control Authority shall ensure that any change in an Industrial User's monitoring point(s) will not allow the User to substitute dilution for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with applicable Standards.

            § 403.7
            Removal credits.
            (a) Introduction—(1) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
            (i) Removal means a reduction in the amount of a pollutant in the POTW's effluent or alteration of the nature of a pollutant during treatment at the POTW. The reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or biological means and may be the result of specifically designed POTW capabilities or may be incidental to the operation of the treatment system. Removal as used in this subpart shall not mean dilution of a pollutant in the POTW.
            (ii) Sludge requirements shall mean the following statutory provisions and regulations or permits issued thereunder (or more stringent State or local regulations): Section 405 of the Clean Water Act; the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) (including title II more commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) and State regulations contained in any State sludge management plan prepared pursuant to subtitle D of SWDA); the Clean Air Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; and the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.
            (2) General. Any POTW receiving wastes from an Industrial User to which a categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) applies may, at its discretion and subject to the conditions of this section, grant removal credits to reflect removal by the POTW of pollutants specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard(s). The POTW may grant a removal credit equal to or, at its discretion, less than its consistent removal rate. Upon being granted a removal credit, each affected Industrial User shall calculate its revised discharge limits in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Removal credits may only be given for indicator or surrogate pollutants regulated in a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the categorical Pretreatment Standard so specifies.
            (3) Conditions for authorization to give removal credits. A POTW is authorized to give removal credits only if the following conditions are met:
            (i) Application. The POTW applies for, and receives, authorization from the Approval Authority to give a removal credit in accordance with the requirements and procedures specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
            (ii) Consistent removal determination. The POTW demonstrates and continues to achieve consistent removal of the pollutant in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
            (iii) POTW local pretreatment program. The POTW has an approved pretreatment program in accordance with and to the extent required by part 403; provided, however, a POTW which does not have an approved pretreatment program may, pending approval of such a program, conditionally give credits as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
            (iv) Sludge requirements. The granting of removal credits will not cause the POTW to violate the local, State and Federal Sludge Requirements which apply to the sludge management method chosen by the POTW. Alternatively, the POTW can demonstrate to the Approval Authority that even though it is not presently in compliance with applicable Sludge Requirements, it will be in compliance when the Industrial User(s) to whom the removal credit would apply is required to meet its categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) as modified by the removal credit. If granting removal credits forces a POTW to incur greater sludge management costs than would be incurred in the absence of granting removal credits, the additional sludge management costs will not be eligible for EPA grant assistance. Removal credits may be made available for the following pollutants.
            (A) For any pollutant listed in appendix G section I of this part for the use or disposal practice employed by the POTW, when the requirements in 40 CFR part 503 for that practice are met.
            (B) For any pollutant listed in appendix G section II of this part for the use or disposal practice employed by the POTW when the concentration for a pollutant listed in appendix G section II of this part in the sewage sludge that is used or disposed does not exceed the concentration for the pollutant in appendix G section II of this part.
            (C) For any pollutant in sewage sludge when the POTW disposes all of its sewage sludge in a municipal solid waste landfill unit that meets the criteria in 40 CFR part 258.
            (v) NPDES permit limitations. The granting of removal credits will not cause a violation of the POTW's permit limitations or conditions. Alternatively, the POTW can demonstrate to the Approval Authority that even though it is not presently in compliance with applicable limitations and conditions in its NPDES permit, it will be in compliance when the Industrial User(s) to whom the removal credit would apply is required to meet its categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), as modified by the removal credit provision.
            (4) Calculation of revised discharge limits. Revised discharge limits for a specific pollutant shall be derived by use of the following formula:
            
              EC15NO91.014
            
            
              where:
              
              x = pollutant discharge limit specified in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard

              r = removal credit for that pollutant as established under paragraph (b) of this section (percentage removal expressed as a proportion, i.e., a number between 0 and 1)
              y = revised discharge limit for the specified pollutant (expressed in same units as x)
            
            
            (b) Establishment of removal credits; demonstration of Consistent Removal—(1) Definition of Consistent Removal. “Consistent Removal” shall mean the average of the lowest 50 percent of the removal measured according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. All sample data obtained for the measured pollutant during the time period prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be reported and used in computing Consistent Removal. If a substance is measurable in the influent but not in the effluent, the effluent level may be assumed to be the limit of measurement, and those data may be used by the POTW at its discretion and subject to approval by the Approval Authority. If the substance is not measurable in the influent, the date may not be used. Where the number of samples with concentrations equal to or above the limit of measurement is between 8 and 12, the average of the lowest 6 removals shall be used. If there are less than 8 samples with concentrations equal to or above the limit of measurement, the Approval Authority may approve alternate means for demonstrating Consistent Removal. The term “measurement” refers to the ability of the analytical method or protocol to quantify as well as identify the presence of the substance in question.
            (2) Consistent Removal data. Influent and effluent operational data demonstrating Consistent Removal or other information, as provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, which demonstrates Consistent Removal of the pollutants for which discharge limit revisions are proposed. This data shall meet the following requirements:
            (i) Representative data; seasonal. The data shall be representative of yearly and seasonal conditions to which the POTW is subjected for each pollutant for which a discharge limit revision is proposed.
            (ii) Representative data; quality and quantity. The data shall be representative of the quality and quantity of normal effluent and influent flow if such data can be obtained. If such data are unobtainable, alternate data or information may be presented for approval to demonstrate Consistent Removal as provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
            (iii) Sampling procedures: Composite. (A) The influent and effluent operational data shall be obtained through 24-hour flow-proportional composite samples. Sampling may be done manually or automatically, and discretely or continuously. For discrete sampling, at least 12 aliquots shall be composited. Discrete sampling may be flow-proportioned either by varying the time interval between each aliquot or the volume of each aliquot. All composites must be flow-proportional to each stream flow at time of collection of influent aliquot or to the total influent flow since the previous influent aliquot. Volatile pollutant aliquots must be combined in the laboratory immediately before analysis.
            (B)(1) Twelve samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals throughout one full year. Sampling must be evenly distributed over the days of the week so as to include no-workdays as well as workdays. If the Approval Authority determines that this schedule will not be most representative of the actual operation of the POTW Treatment Plant, an alternative sampling schedule will be approved.
            (2) In addition, upon the Approval Authority's concurrence, a POTW may utilize an historical data base amassed prior to the effective data of this section provide that such data otherwise meet the requirements of this paragraph. In order for the historical data base to be approved it must present a statistically valid description of daily, weekly and seasonal sewage treatment plant loadings and performance for at least one year.
            (C) Effluent sample collection need not be delayed to compensate for hydraulic detention unless the POTW elects to include detention time compensation or unless the Approval Authority requires detention time compensation. The Approval Authority may require that each effluent sample be taken approximately one detention time later than the corresponding influent sample when failure to do so would result in an unrepresentative portrayal of actual POTW operation. The detention period is to be based on a 24-hour average daily flow value. The average daily flow used will be based upon the average of the daily flows during the same month of the previous year.
            (iv) Sampling procedures: Grab. Where composite sampling is not an appropriate sampling technique, a grab sample(s) shall be taken to obtain influent and effluent operational data. Collection of influent grab samples should precede collection of effluent samples by approximately one detention period. The detention period is to be based on a 24-hour average daily flow value. The average daily flow used will be based upon the average of the daily flows during the same month of the previous year. Grab samples will be required, for example, where the parameters being evaluated are those, such as cyanide and phenol, which may not be held for any extended period because of biological, chemical or physical interactions which take place after sample collection and affect the results. A grab sample is an individual sample collected over a period of time not exceeding 15 minutes.
            (v) Analytical methods. The sampling referred to in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section and an analysis of these samples shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator.
            (vi) Calculation of removal. All data acquired under the provisions of this section must be submitted to the Approval Authority. Removal for a specific pollutant shall be determined either, for each sample, by measuring the difference between the concentrations of the pollutant in the influent and effluent of the POTW and expressing the difference as a percent of the influent concentration, or, where such data cannot be obtained, Removal may be demonstrated using other data or procedures subject to concurrence by the Approval Authority as provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
            (c) Provisional credits. For pollutants which are not being discharged currently (i.e., new or modified facilities, or production changes) the POTW may apply for authorization to give removal credits prior to the initial discharge of the pollutant. Consistent removal shall be based provisionally on data from treatability studies or demonstrated removal at other treatment facilities where the quality and quantity of influent are similar. Within 18 months after the commencement of discharge of pollutants in question, consistent removal must be demonstrated pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If, within 18 months after the commencement of the discharge of the pollutant in question, the POTW cannot demonstrate consistent removal pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the authority to grant provisional removal credits shall be terminated by the Approval Authority and all Industrial Users to whom the revised discharge limits had been applied shall achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) within a reasonable time, not to exceed the period of time prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), as may be specified by the Approval Authority.
            (d) Exception to POTW Pretreatment Program Requirement. A POTW required to develop a local pretreatment program by § 403.8 may conditionally give removal credits pending approval of such a program in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
            (1) All Industrial Users who are currently subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard and who wish conditionally to receive a removal credit must submit to the POTW the information required in § 403.12(b)(1) through (7) (except new or modified industrial users must only submit the information required by § 403.12(b)(1) through (6)), pertaining to the categorical Pretreatment Standard as modified by the removal credit. The Industrial Users shall indicate what additional technology, if any, will be needed to comply with the categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) as modified by the removal credit;

            (2) The POTW must have submitted to the Approval Authority an application for pretreatment program approval meeting the requirements of §§ 403.8 and 403.9 in a timely manner, not to exceed the time limitation set forth in a compliance schedule for development of a pretreatment program included in the POTW's NPDES permit, but in no case later than July 1, 1983, where no permit deadline exists;
            (3) The POTW must:
            (i) Compile and submit data demonstrating its consistent removal in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;
            (ii) Comply with the conditions specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and
            (iii) Submit a complete application for removal credit authority in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;
            (4) If a POTW receives authority to grant conditional removal credits and the Approval Authority subsequently makes a final determination, after appropriate notice, that the POTW failed to comply with the conditions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, the authority to grant conditional removal credits shall be terminated by the Approval Authority and all Industrial Users to whom the revised discharge limits had been applied shall achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) within a reasonable time, not to exceed the period of time prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), as may be specified by the Approval Authority.
            (5) If a POTW grants conditional removal credits and the POTW or the Approval Authority subsequently makes a final determination, after appropriate notice, that the Industrial User(s) failed to comply with the conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the conditional credit shall be terminated by the POTW or the Approval Authority for the non-complying Industrial User(s) and the Industrial User(s) to whom the revised discharge limits had been applied shall achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) within a reasonable time, not to exceed the period of time prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), as may be specified by the Approval Authority. The conditional credit shall not be terminated where a violation of the provisions of this paragraph results from causes entirely outside of the control of the Industrial User(s) or the Industrial User(s) had demonstrated substantial compliance.
            (6) The Approval Authority may elect not to review an application for conditional removal credit authority upon receipt of such application, in which case the conditionally revised discharge limits will remain in effect until reviewed by the Approval Authority. This review may occur at any time in accordance with the procedures of § 403.11, but in no event later than the time of any pretreatment program approval or any NPDES permit reissuance thereunder.
            (e) POTW application for authorization to give removal credits and Approval Authority review—(1) Who must apply. Any POTW that wants to give a removal credit must apply for authorization from the Approval Authority.
            (2) To whom application is made. An application for authorization to give removal credits (or modify existing ones) shall be submitted by the POTW to the Approval Authority.
            (3) When to apply. A POTW may apply for authorization to give or modify removal credits at any time.
            (4) Contents of the application. An application for authorization to give removal credits must be supported by the following information:
            (i) List of pollutants. A list of pollutants for which removal credits are proposed.
            (ii) Consistent Removal data. The data required pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
            (iii) Calculation of revised discharge limits. Proposed revised discharge limits for each affected subcategory of Industrial Users calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
            (iv) Local Pretreatment Program Certification. A certification that the POTW has an approved local pretreatment program or qualifies for the exception to this requirement found at paragraph (d) of this section.
            (v) Sludge management certification. A specific description of the POTW's current methods of using or disposing of its sludge and a certification that the granting of removal credits will not cause a violation of the sludge requirements identified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section.
            
            (vi) NPDES permit limit certification. A certification that the granting of removal credits will not cause a violation of the POTW's NPDES permit limits and conditions as required in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section.
            (5) Approval Authority review. The Approval Authority shall review the POTW's application for authorization to give or modify removal credits in accordance with the procedures of § 403.11 and shall, in no event, have more that 180 days from public notice of an application to complete review.
            (6) EPA review of State removal credit approvals. Where the NPDES State has an approved pretreatment program, the Regional Administrator may agree in the Memorandum of Agreement under 40 CFR 123.24(d) to waive the right to review and object to submissions for authority to grant removal credits. Such an agreement shall not restrict the Regional Administrator's right to comment upon or object to permits issued to POTW's except to the extent 40 CFR 123.24(d) allows such restriction.
            (7) Nothing in these regulations precludes an Industrial User or other interested party from assisting the POTW in preparing and presenting the information necessary to apply for authorization.
            (f) Continuation and withdrawal of authorization—(1) Effect of authorization. (i) Once a POTW has received authorization to grant removal credits for a particular pollutant regulated in a categorical Pretreatment Standard it may automatically extend that removal credit to the same pollutant when it is regulated in other categorical standards, unless granting the removal credit will cause the POTW to violate the sludge requirements identified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section or its NPDES permit limits and conditions as required by paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section. If a POTW elects at a later time to extend removal credits to a certain categorical Pretreatment Standard, industrial subcategory or one or more Industrial Users that initially were not granted removal credits, it must notify the Approval Authority.
            (2) Inclusion in POTW permit. Once authority is granted, the removal credits shall be included in the POTW's NPDES Permit as soon as possible and shall become an enforceable requirement of the POTW's NPDES permit. The removal credits will remain in effect for the term of the POTW's NPDES permit, provided the POTW maintains compliance with the conditions specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
            (3) Compliance monitoring. Following authorization to give removal credits, a POTW shall continue to monitor and report on (at such intervals as may be specified by the Approval Authority, but in no case less than once per year) the POTW's removal capabilities. A minimum of one representative sample per month during the reporting period is required, and all sampling data must be included in the POTW's compliance report.
            (4) Modification or withdrawal of removal credits—(i) Notice of POTW. The Approval Authority shall notify the POTW if, on the basis of pollutant removal capability reports received pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section or other relevant information available to it, the Approval Authority determines:
            (A) That one or more of the discharge limit revisions made by the POTW, of the POTW itself, no longer meets the requirements of this section, or
            (B) That such discharge limit revisions are causing a violation of any conditions or limits contained in the POTW's NPDES Permit.
            (ii) Corrective action. If appropriate corrective action is not taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 days unless the POTW or the affected Industrial Users demonstrate that a longer time period is reasonably necessary to undertake the appropriate corrective action, the Approval Authority shall either withdraw such discharge limits or require modifications in the revised discharge limits.
            (iii) Public notice of withdrawal or modification. The Approval Authority shall not withdraw or modify revised discharge limits unless it shall first have notified the POTW and all Industrial Users to whom revised discharge limits have been applied, and made public, in writing, the reasons for such withdrawal or modification, and an opportunity is provided for a hearing. Following such notice and withdrawal or modification, all Industrial Users to whom revised discharge limits had been applied, shall be subject to the modified discharge limits or the discharge limits prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards, as appropriate, and shall achieve compliance with such limits within a reasonable time (not to exceed the period of time prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) as may be specified by the Approval Authority.
            (g) Removal credits in State-run pretreatment programs under § 403.10(e). Where an NPDES State with an approved pretreatment program elects to implement a local pretreatment program in lieu or requiring the POTW to develop such a program (as provided in § 403.10(e)), the POTW will not be required to develop a pretreatment program as a precondition to obtaining authorization to give removal credits. The POTW will, however, be required to comply with the other conditions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
            (h) Compensation for overflow. “Overflow” means the intentional or unintentional diversion of flow from the POTW before the POTW Treatment Plant. POTWs which at least once annually Overflow untreated wastewater to receiving waters may claim Consistent Removal of a pollutant only by complying with either paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section. However, paragraph (h) of this section shall not apply where Industrial User(s) can demonstrate that Overflow does not occur between the Industrial User(s) and the POTW Treatment Plant;
            (1) The Industrial User provides containment or otherwise ceases or reduces Discharges from the regulated processes which contain the pollutant for which an allowance is requested during all circumstances in which an Overflow event can reasonably be expected to occur at the POTW or at a sewer to which the Industrial User is connected. Discharges must cease or be reduced, or pretreatment must be increased, to the extent necessary to compensate for the removal not being provided by the POTW. Allowances under this provision will only be granted where the POTW submits to the Approval Authority evidence that:
            (i) All Industrial Users to which the POTW proposes to apply this provision have demonstrated the ability to contain or otherwise cease or reduce, during circumstances in which an Overflow event can reasonably be expected to occur, Discharges from the regulated processes which contain pollutants for which an allowance is requested;
            (ii) The POTW has identified circumstances in which an Overflow event can reasonably be expected to occur, and has a notification or other viable plan to insure that Industrial Users will learn of an impending Overflow in sufficient time to contain, cease or reduce Discharging to prevent untreated Overflows from occurring. The POTW must also demonstrate that it will monitor and verify the data required in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, to insure that Industrial Users are containing, ceasing or reducing operations during POTW System Overflow; and
            (iii) All Industrial Users to which the POTW proposes to apply this provision have demonstrated the ability and commitment to collect and make available, upon request by the POTW, State Director or EPA Regional Administrator, daily flow reports or other data sufficient to demonstrate that all Discharges from regulated processes containing the pollutant for which the allowance is requested were contained, reduced or otherwise ceased, as appropriate, during all circumstances in which an Overflow event was reasonably expected to occur; or
            (2)(i) The Consistent Removal claimed is reduced pursuant to the following equation:
            
              ER14OC05.000
            
            
              Where:
              
              rm = POTW's Consistent Removal rate for that pollutant as established under paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(2) of this section
              rc = removal corrected by the Overflow factor

              Z = hours per year that Overflows occurred between the Industrial User(s) and the POTW Treatment Plant, the hours either to be shown in the POTW's current NPDES permit application or the hours, as demonstrated by verifiable techniques, that a particular Industrial User's Discharge Overflows between the Industrial User and the POTW Treatment Plant; and
            
            
            (ii) The POTW is complying with all NPDES permit requirements and any additional requirements in any order or decree, issued pursuant to the Clean Water Act affecting combined sewer overflows. These requirements include, but are not limited to, any combined sewer overflow requirements that conform to the Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy.
            [49 FR 31221, Aug. 3, 1984, as amended at 51 FR 20430, June 4, 1986; 53 FR 42435, Nov. 5, 1987; 58 FR 9386, Feb. 19, 1993; 58 FR 18017, Apr. 7, 1993; 70 FR 60193, Oct. 14, 2005]
          
          
            § 403.8
            Pretreatment Program Requirements: Development and Implementation by POTW.
            (a) POTWs required to develop a pretreatment program. Any POTW (or combination of POTWs operated by the same authority) with a total design flow greater than 5 million gallons per day (mgd) and receiving from Industrial Users pollutants which Pass Through or Interfere with the operation of the POTW or are otherwise subject to Pretreatment Standards will be required to establish a POTW Pretreatment Program unless the NPDES State exercises its option to assume local responsibilities as provided for in § 403.10(e). The Regional Administrator or Director may require that a POTW with a design flow of 5 mgd or less develop a POTW Pretreatment Program if he or she finds that the nature or volume of the industrial influent, treatment process upsets, violations of POTW effluent limitations, contamination of municipal sludge, or other circumstances warrant in order to prevent Interference with the POTW or Pass Through.
            (b) Deadline for Program Approval. A POTW which meets the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section must receive approval of a POTW Pretreatment Program no later than 3 years after the reissuance or modification of its existing NPDES permit but in no case later than July 1, 1983. POTWs whose NPDES permits are modified under section 301(h) of the Act shall have a Pretreatment Program within three (3) years as provided for in 40 CFR part 125, subpart G. POTWs identified after July 1, 1983 as being required to develop a POTW Pretreatment Program under paragraph (a) of this section shall develop and submit such a program for approval as soon as possible, but in no case later than one year after written notification from the Approval Authority of such identification. The POTW Pretreatment Program shall meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (f) of this section and shall be administered by the POTW to ensure compliance by Industrial Users with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
            (c) Incorporation of approved programs in permits. A POTW may develop an appropriate POTW Pretreatment Program any time before the time limit set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The POTW's NPDES Permit will be reissued or modified by the NPDES State or EPA to incorporate the approved Program as enforceable conditions of the Permit. The modification of a POTW's NPDES Permit for the purposes of incorporating a POTW Pretreatment Program approved in accordance with the procedure in § 403.11 shall be deemed a minor Permit modification subject to the procedures in 40 CFR 122.63.
            (d) Incorporation of compliance schedules in permits. [Reserved]
            (e) Cause for reissuance or modification of Permits. Under the authority of section 402(b)(1)(C) of the Act, the Approval Authority may modify, or alternatively, revoke and reissue a POTW's Permit in order to:

            (1) Put the POTW on a compliance schedule for the development of a POTW Pretreatment Program where the addition of pollutants into a POTW by an Industrial User or combination of Industrial Users presents a substantial hazard to the functioning of the treatment works, quality of the receiving waters, human health, or the environment;
            
            (2) Coordinate the issuance of a section 201 construction grant with the incorporation into a permit of a compliance schedule for POTW Pretreatment Program;
            (3) Incorporate a modification of the permit approved under section 301(h) or 301(i) of the Act;
            (4) Incorporate an approved POTW Pretreatment Program in the POTW permit; or
            (5) Incorporate a compliance schedule for the development of a POTW pretreatment program in the POTW permit.
            (6) Incorporate the removal credits (established under § 403.7) in the POTW permit.
            (f) POTW pretreatment requirements. A POTW pretreatment program must be based on the following legal authority and include the following procedures. These authorities and procedures shall at all times be fully and effectively exercised and implemented.
            (1) Legal authority. The POTW shall operate pursuant to legal authority enforceable in Federal, State or local courts, which authorizes or enables the POTW to apply and to enforce the requirements of sections 307 (b) and (c), and 402(b)(8) of the Act and any regulations implementing those sections. Such authority may be contained in a statute, ordinance, or series of contracts or joint powers agreements which the POTW is authorized to enact, enter into or implement, and which are authorized by State law. At a minimum, this legal authority shall enable the POTW to:
            (i) Deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or changes in the nature of pollutants, to the POTW by Industrial Users where such contributions do not meet applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements or where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit;
            (ii) Require compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements by Industrial Users;
            (iii) Control through Permit, order, or similar means, the contribution to the POTW by each Industrial User to ensure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. In the case of Industrial Users identified as significant under § 403.3(v), this control shall be achieved through individual permits or equivalent individual control mechanisms issued to each such User except as follows.
            (A)(1) At the discretion of the POTW, this control may include use of general control mechanisms if the following conditions are met. All of the facilities to be covered must:
            (i) Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
            (ii) Discharge the same types of wastes;
            (iii) Require the same effluent limitations;
            (iv) Require the same or similar monitoring; and
            (v) In the opinion of the POTW, are more appropriately controlled under a general control mechanism than under individual control mechanisms.
            (2) To be covered by the general control mechanism, the Significant Industrial User must file a written request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all wastes covered by the general control mechanism, any requests in accordance with § 403.12(e)(2) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, and any other information the POTW deems appropriate. A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge is not effective in the general control mechanism until after the POTW has provided written notice to the Significant Industrial User that such a waiver request has been granted in accordance with § 403.12(e)(2). The POTW must retain a copy of the general control mechanism, documentation to support the POTW's determination that a specific Significant Industrial User meets the criteria in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(A)(1) through (5) of this section, and a copy of the User's written request for coverage for 3 years after the expiration of the general control mechanism. A POTW may not control a Significant Industrial User through a general control mechanism where the facility is subject to production-based categorical Pretreatment Standards or categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or for Industrial Users whose limits are based on the Combined Wastestream Formula or Net/Gross calculations (§§ 403.6(e) and 403.15).
            (B) Both individual and general control mechanisms must be enforceable and contain, at a minimum, the following conditions:
            (1) Statement of duration (in no case more than five years);
            (2) Statement of non-transferability without, at a minimum, prior notification to the POTW and provision of a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator;
            (3) Effluent limits, including Best Management Practices, based on applicable general Pretreatment Standards in part 403 of this chapter, categorical Pretreatment Standards, local limits, and State and local law;
            (4) Self-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and recordkeeping requirements, including an identification of the pollutants to be monitored (including the process for seeking a waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge in accordance with § 403.12(e)(2), or a specific waived pollutant in the case of an individual control mechanism), sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type, based on the applicable general Pretreatment Standards in part 403 of this chapter, categorical Pretreatment Standards, local limits, and State and local law;
            (5) Statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of Pretreatment Standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedules may not extend the compliance date beyond applicable federal deadlines;
            (6) Requirements to control Slug Discharges, if determined by the POTW to be necessary.
            (iv) Require (A) the development of a compliance schedule by each Industrial User for the installation of technology required to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements and (B) the submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from Industrial Users as are necessary to assess and assure compliance by Industrial Users with Pretreatment Standards and Requirements, including but not limited to the reports required in § 403.12.
            (v) Carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to determine, independent of information supplied by Industrial Users, compliance or noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements by Industrial Users. Representatives of the POTW shall be authorized to enter any premises of any Industrial User in which a Discharge source or treatment system is located or in which records are required to be kept under § 403.12(o) to assure compliance with Pretreatment Standards. Such authority shall be at least as extensive as the authority provided under section 308 of the Act;
            (vi)(A) Obtain remedies for noncompliance by any Industrial User with any Pretreatment Standard and Requirement. All POTW's shall be able to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by Industrial Users with Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. All POTWs shall also have authority to seek or assess civil or criminal penalties in at least the amount of $1,000 a day for each violation by Industrial Users of Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.

            (B) Pretreatment requirements which will be enforced through the remedies set forth in paragraph (f)(1)(vi)(A) of this section, will include but not be limited to, the duty to allow or carry out inspections, entry, or monitoring activities; any rules, regulations, or orders issued by the POTW; any requirements set forth in control mechanisms issued by the POTW; or any reporting requirements imposed by the POTW or these regulations in this part. The POTW shall have authority and procedures (after informal notice to the discharger) immediately and effectively to halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appears to present an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The POTW shall also have authority and procedures (which shall include notice to the affected industrial users and an opportunity to respond) to halt or prevent any discharge to the POTW which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment or which threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW. The Approval Authority shall have authority to seek judicial relief and may also use administrative penalty authority when the POTW has sought a monetary penalty which the Approval Authority believes to be insufficient.
            (vii) Comply with the confidentiality requirements set forth in § 403.14.
            (2) Procedures. The POTW shall develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with the requirements of a Pretreatment Program. At a minimum, these procedures shall enable the POTW to:
            (i) Identify and locate all possible Industrial Users which might be subject to the POTW Pretreatment Program. Any compilation, index or inventory of Industrial Users made under this paragraph shall be made available to the Regional Administrator or Director upon request;
            (ii) Identify the character and volume of pollutants contributed to the POTW by the Industrial Users identified under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. This information shall be made available to the Regional Administrator or Director upon request;
            (iii) Notify Industrial Users identified under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, of applicable Pretreatment Standards and any applicable requirements under sections 204(b) and 405 of the Act and subtitles C and D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Within 30 days of approval pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), of a list of significant industrial users, notify each significant industrial user of its status as such and of all requirements applicable to it as a result of such status.
            (iv) Receive and analyze self-monitoring reports and other notices submitted by Industrial Users in accordance with the self-monitoring requirements in § 403.12;
            (v) Randomly sample and analyze the effluent from Industrial Users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by Industrial Users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with Pretreatment Standards. Inspect and sample the effluent from each Significant Industrial User at least once a year, except as otherwise specified below:
            (A) Where the POTW has authorized the Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard in accordance with § 403.12(e)(3), the POTW must sample for the waived pollutant(s) at least once during the term of the Categorical Industrial User's control mechanism. In the event that the POTW subsequently determines that a waived pollutant is present or is expected to be present in the Industrial User's wastewater based on changes that occur in the User's operations, the POTW must immediately begin at least annual effluent monitoring of the User's Discharge and inspection.
            (B) Where the POTW has determined that an Industrial User meets the criteria for classification as a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User, the POTW must evaluate, at least once per year, whether an Industrial User continues to meet the criteria in § 403.3(v)(2).
            (C) In the case of Industrial Users subject to reduced reporting requirements under § 403.12(e)(3), the POTW must randomly sample and analyze the effluent from Industrial Users and conduct inspections at least once every two years. If the Industrial User no longer meets the conditions for reduced reporting in § 403.12(e)(3), the POTW must immediately begin sampling and inspecting the Industrial User at least once a year.

            (vi) Evaluate whether each such Significant Industrial User needs a plan or other action to control Slug Discharges. For Industrial Users identified as significant prior to November 14, 2005, this evaluation must have been conducted at least once by October 14, 2006; additional Significant Industrial Users must be evaluated within 1 year of being designated a Significant Industrial User. For purposes of this subsection, a Slug Discharge is any Discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature, including but not limited to an accidental spill or a non-customary batch Discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause Interference or Pass Through, or in any other way violate the POTW's regulations, local limits or Permit conditions. The results of such activities shall be available to the Approval Authority upon request. Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a Slug Discharge. If the POTW decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
            (A) Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch Discharges;
            (B) Description of stored chemicals;
            (C) Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of Slug Discharges, including any Discharge that would violate a prohibition under § 403.5(b) with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days;
            (D) If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response;
            (vii) Investigate instances of noncompliance with Pretreatment Standards and Requirements, as indicated in the reports and notices required under § 403.12, or indicated by analysis, inspection, and surveillance activities described in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section. Sample taking and analysis and the collection of other information shall be performed with sufficient care to produce evidence admissible in enforcement proceedings or in judicial actions; and
            (viii) Comply with the public participation requirements of 40 CFR part 25 in the enforcement of National Pretreatment Standards. These procedures shall include provision for at least annual public notification in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW of Industrial Users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a Significant Industrial User (or any Industrial User which violates paragraphs (f)(2)(viii)(C), (D), or (H) of this section) is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
            (A) Chronic violations of wastewater Discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a 6-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l);
            (B) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a 6-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
            (C) Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative Standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other Discharges, Interference or Pass Through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
            (D) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under paragraph (f)(1)(vi)(B) of this section to halt or prevent such a discharge;
            (E) Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;

            (F) Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
            (G) Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
            (H) Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a violation of Best Management Practices, which the POTW determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local Pretreatment program.
            (3) Funding. The POTW shall have sufficient resources and qualified personnel to carry out the authorities and procedures described in paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of this section. In some limited circumstances, funding and personnel may be delayed where (i) the POTW has adequate legal authority and procedures to carry out the Pretreatment Program requirements described in this section, and (ii) a limited aspect of the Program does not need to be implemented immediately (see § 403.9(b)).
            (4) Local limits. The POTW shall develop local limits as required in § 403.5(c)(1), or demonstrate that they are not necessary.
            (5) The POTW shall develop and implement an enforcement response plan. This plan shall contain detailed procedures indicating how a POTW will investigate and respond to instances of industrial user noncompliance. The plan shall, at a minimum:
            (i) Describe how the POTW will investigate instances of noncompliance;
            (ii) Describe the types of escalating enforcement responses the POTW will take in response to all anticipated types of industrial user violations and the time periods within which responses will take place;
            (iii) Identify (by title) the official(s) responsible for each type of response;
            (iv) Adequately reflect the POTW's primary responsibility to enforce all applicable pretreatment requirements and standards, as detailed in 40 CFR 403.8 (f)(1) and (f)(2).
            (6) The POTW shall prepare and maintain a list of its Industrial Users meeting the criteria in § 403.3(v)(1). The list shall identify the criteria in § 403.3(v)(1) applicable to each Industrial User and, where applicable, shall also indicate whether the POTW has made a determination pursuant to § 403.3(v)(2) that such Industrial User should not be considered a Significant Industrial User. The initial list shall be submitted to the Approval Authority pursuant to § 403.9 or as a non-substantial modification pursuant to § 403.18(d). Modifications to the list shall be submitted to the Approval Authority pursuant to § 403.12(i)(1).
            (g) A POTW that chooses to receive electronic documents must satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).

            § 403.9
            POTW pretreatment programs and/or authorization to revise pretreatment standards: Submission for approval.
            (a) Who approves Program. A POTW requesting approval of a POTW Pretreatment Program shall develop a program description which includes the information set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. This description shall be submitted to the Approval Authority which will make a determination on the request for program approval in accordance with the procedures described in § 403.11.
            (b) Contents of POTW program submission. The program description must contain the following information:
            (1) A statement from the City Solicitor or a city official acting in a comparable capacity (or the attorney for those POTWs which have independent legal counsel) that the POTW has authority adequate to carry out the programs described in § 403.8. This statement shall:
            (i) Identify the provision of the legal authority under § 403.8(f)(1) which provides the basis for each procedure under § 403.8(f)(2);

            (ii) Identify the manner in which the POTW will implement the program requirements set forth in § 403.8, including the means by which Pretreatment Standards will be applied to individual Industrial Users (e.g., by order, permit, ordinance, etc.); and,
            
            (iii) Identify how the POTW intends to ensure compliance with Pretreatment Standards and Requirements, and to enforce them in the event of noncompliance by Industrial Users;
            (2) A copy of any statutes, ordinances, regulations, agreements, or other authorities relied upon by the POTW for its administration of the Program. This Submission shall include a statement reflecting the endorsement or approval of the local boards or bodies responsible for supervising and/or funding the POTW Pretreatment Program if approved;
            (3) A brief description (including organization charts) of the POTW organization which will administer the Pretreatment Program.

            (4) A description of the funding levels and full- and part-time manpower available to implement the Program;
            (c) Conditional POTW program approval. The POTW may request conditional approval of the Pretreatment Program pending the acquisition of funding and personnel for certain elements of the Program. The request for conditional approval must meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section except that the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, may be relaxed if the Submission demonstrates that:
            (1) A limited aspect of the Program does not need to be implemented immediately;
            (2) The POTW had adequate legal authority and procedures to carry out those aspects of the Program which will not be implemented immediately; and
            (3) Funding and personnel for the Program aspects to be implemented at a later date will be available when needed. The POTW will describe in the Submission the mechanism by which this funding will be acquired. Upon receipt of a request for conditional approval, the Approval Authority will establish a fixed date for the acquisition of the needed funding and personnel. If funding is not acquired by this date, the conditional approval of the POTW Pretreatment Program and any removal allowances granted to the POTW, may be modified or withdrawn.
            (d) Content of removal allowance submission. The request for authority to revise categorical Pretreatment Standards must contain the information required in § 403.7(d).
            (e) Approval authority action. Any POTW requesting POTW Pretreatment Program approval shall submit to the Approval Authority three copies of the Submission described in paragraph (b), and if appropriate, (d) of this section. Within 60 days after receiving the Submission, the Approval Authority shall make a preliminary determination of whether the Submission meets the requirements of paragraph (b) and, if appropriate, (d) of this section. If the Approval Authority makes the preliminary determination that the Submission meets these requirements, the Approval Authority shall:
            (1) Notify the POTW that the Submission has been received and is under review; and
            (2) Commence the public notice and evaluation activities set forth in § 403.11.
            (f) Notification where submission is defective. If, after review of the Submission as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, the Approval Authority determines that the Submission does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and, if appropriate, paragraph (d), of this section, the Approval Authority shall provide notice in writing to the applying POTW and each person who has requested individual notice. This notification shall identify any defects in the Submission and advise the POTW and each person who has requested individual notice of the means by which the POTW can comply with the applicable requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) of this section, and, if appropriate, paragraph (d) of this section.
            (g) Consistency with water quality management plans. (1) In order to be approved the POTW Pretreatment Program shall be consistent with any approved water quality management plan developed in accordance with 40 CFR parts 130, 131, as revised, where such 208 plan includes Management Agency designations and addresses pretreatment in a manner consistent with 40 CFR part 403. In order to assure such consistency the Approval Authority shall solicit the review and comment of the appropriate 208 Planning Agency during the public comment period provided for in § 403.11(b)(1)(ii) prior to approval or disapproval of the Program.
            (2) Where no 208 plan has been approved or where a plan has been approved but lacks Management Agency designations and/or does not address pretreatment in a manner consistent with this regulation, the Approval Authority shall nevertheless solicit the review and comment of the appropriate 208 planning agency.

            § 403.10
            Development and submission of NPDES State pretreatment programs.
            (a) Approval of State Programs. No State NPDES program shall be approved under section 402 of the Act after the effective date of these regulations unless it is determined to meet the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this regulation, a State will be required to act upon those authorities which it currently possesses before the approval of a State Pretreatment Program.
            (b) [Reserved]
            (c) Failure to request approval. Failure of an NPDES State with a permit program approved under section 402 of the Act prior to December 27, 1977, to seek approval of a State Pretreatment Program and failure of an approved State to administer its State Pretreatment Program in accordance with the requirements of this section constitutes grounds for withdrawal of NPDES program approval under section 402(c)(3) of the Act.
            (d) [Reserved]
            (e) State Program in lieu of POTW Program. Notwithstanding the provision of § 403.8(a), a State with an approved Pretreatment Program may assume responsibility for implementing the POTW Pretreatment Program requirements set forth in § 403.8(f) in lieu of requiring the POTW to develop a Pretreatment Program. However, this does not preclude POTW's from independently developing Pretreatment Programs.
            (f) State Pretreatment Program requirements. In order to be approved, a request for State Pretreatment Program Approval must demonstrate that the State Pretreatment Program has the following elements:
            (1) Legal authority. The Attorney General's Statement submitted in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section shall certify that the Director has authority under State law to operate and enforce the State Pretreatment Program to the extent required by this part and by 40 CFR 123.27. At a minimum, the Director shall have the authority to:
            (i) Incorporate POTW Pretreatment Program conditions into permits issued to POTW's; require compliance by POTW's with these incorporated permit conditions; and require compliance by Industrial Users with Pretreatment Standards;
            (ii) Ensure continuing compliance by POTW's with pretreatment conditions incorporated into the POTW Permit through review of monitoring reports submitted to the Director by the POTW in accordance with § 403.12 and ensure continuing compliance by Industrial Users with Pretreatment Standards through the review of self-monitoring reports submitted to the POTW or to the Director by the Industrial Users in accordance with § 403.12;
            (iii) Carry out inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures which will determine, independent of information supplied by the POTW, compliance or noncompliance by the POTW with pretreatment conditions incorporated into the POTW Permit; and carry out inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures which will determine, independent of information supplied by the Industrial User, whether the Industrial User is in compliance with Pretreatment Standards;

            (iv) Seek civil and criminal penalties, and injunctive relief, for noncompliance by the POTW with pretreatment conditions incorporated into the POTW Permit and for noncompliance with Pretreatment Standards by Industrial Users as set forth in § 403.8(f)(1)(vi). The Director shall have authority to seek judicial relief for noncompliance by Industrial Users even when the POTW has acted to seek such relief (e.g., if the POTW has sought a penalty which the Director finds to be insufficient);
            (v) Approve and deny requests for approval of POTW Pretreatment Programs submitted by a POTW to the Director;
            (vi) Deny and recommend approval of (but not approve) requests for Fundamentally Different Factors variances submitted by Industrial Users in accordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in § 403.13; and
            (vii) Approve and deny requests for authority to modify categorical Pretreatment Standards to reflect removals achieved by the POTW in accordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in §§ 403.7, 403.9 and 403.11.
            (2) Procedures. The Director shall have developed procedures to carry out the requirements of sections 307 (b) and (c), and 402(b)(1), 402(b)(2), 402(b)(8), and 402(b)(9) of the Act. At a minimum, these procedures shall enable the Director to:
            (i) Identify POTW's required to develop Pretreatment Programs in accordance with § 403.8(a) and notify these POTW's of the need to develop a POTW Pretreatment Program. In the absence of a POTW Pretreatment Program, the State shall have procedures to carry out the activities set forth in § 403.8(f)(2);
            (ii) Provide technical and legal assistance to POTW's in developing Pretreatment Programs;
            (iii) Develop compliance schedules for inclusion in POTW Permits which set forth the shortest reasonable time schedule for the completion of tasks needed to implement a POTW Pretreatment Program. The final compliance date in these schedules shall be no later than July 1, 1983;
            (iv) Sample and analyze:
            (A) Influent and effluent of the POTW to identify, independent of information supplied by the POTW, compliance or noncompliance with pollutant removal levels set forth in the POTW permit (see § 403.7); and
            (B) The contents of sludge from the POTW and methods of sludge disposal and use to identify, independent of information supplied by the POTW, compliance or noncompliance with requirements applicable to the selected method of sludge management;
            (v) Investigate evidence of violations of pretreatment conditions set forth in the POTW Permit by taking samples and acquiring other information as needed. This data acquisition shall be performed with sufficient care as to produce evidence admissible in an enforcement proceeding or in court;
            (vi) Review and approve requests for approval of POTW Pretreatment Programs and authority to modify categorical Pretreatment Standards submitted by a POTW to the Director; and
            (vii) Consider requests for Fundamentally Different Factors variances submitted by Industrial Users in accordance with the criteria and procedures set forth in § 403.13.
            (viii) Regularly notify all Control Authorities of electronic submission requirements of 40 CFR part 127.
            (3) Funding. The Director shall assure that funding and qualified personnel are available to carry out the authorities and procedures described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section.
            (g) Content of State Pretreatment Program submission. The request for State Pretreatment Program approval will consist of:
            (1)(i) A statement from the State Attorney General (or the Attorney for those State agencies which have independent legal counsel) that the laws of the State provide adequate authority to implement the requirements of this part. The authorities cited by the Attorney General in this statement shall be in the form of lawfully adopted State statutes or regulations which shall be effective by the time of approval of the State Pretreatment Program; and
            (ii) Copies of all State statutes and regulations cited in the above statement;

            (iii) States with approved Pretreatment Programs shall establish Pretreatment regulations by November 16, 1989, unless the State would be required to enact or amend statutory provision, in which case, such regulations must be established by November 16, 1990.
            (2) A description of the funding levels and full- and part-time personnel available to implement the program; and
            (3) Any modifications or additions to the Memorandum of Agreement (required by 40 CFR 123.24) which may be necessary for EPA and the State to implement the requirements of this part.
            (h) EPA Action. Any approved NPDES State requesting State Pretreatment Program approval shall submit to the Regional Administrator three copies of the Submission described in paragraph (g) of this section. Upon a preliminary determination that the Submission meets the requirements of paragraph (g) the Regional Administrator shall:
            (1) Notify the Director that the Submission has been received and is under review; and
            (2) Commence the program revision process set out in 40 CFR 123.62. For purposes of that section all requests for approval of State Pretreatment Programs shall be deemed substantial program modifications. A comment period of at least 30 days and the opportunity for a hearing shall be afforded the public on all such proposed program revisions.
            (i) Notification where submission is defective. If, after review of the Submission as provided for in paragraph (h) of this section, EPA determines that the Submission does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) or (g) of this section EPA shall so notify the applying NPDES State in writing. This notification shall identify any defects in the Submission and advise the NPDES State of the means by which it can comply with the requirements of this part.

            § 403.12
            Reporting requirements for POTW's and industrial users.
            (a) [Reserved]
            (b) Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standard—baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical Pretreatment Standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing Industrial Users subject to such categorical Pretreatment Standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the Control Authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1)-(7) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, New Sources, and sources that become Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical Standard, shall be required to submit to the Control Authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1)-(5) of this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New Sources shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs (b) (4) and (5) of this section:
            (1) Identifying information. The User shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners;
            (2) Permits. The User shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility;
            (3) Description of operations. The User shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and Standard Industrial Classification of the operation(s) carried out by such Industrial User. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of Discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
            (4) Flow measurement. The User shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
            (i) Regulated process streams; and
            (ii) Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of § 403.6(e). (See paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section.)
            The Control Authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations.
            (5) Measurement of pollutants. (i) The user shall identify the Pretreatment Standards applicable to each regulated process;
            (ii) In addition, the User shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the Standard or Control Authority) of regulated pollutants in the Discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice or pollution prevention alternative, the User shall submit documentation as required by the Control Authority or the applicable Standards to determine compliance with the Standard;
            (iii) The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.

            (iv) Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of § 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with § 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Control Authority;
            (v) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator;
            (vi) The Control Authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
            (vii) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant Discharges to the POTW;
            (6) Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the Industrial User (as defined in paragraph (l) of this section) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional Pretreatment is required for the Industrial User to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements; and
            (7) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will be required to meet the Pretreatment Standards; the shortest schedule by which the Industrial User will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard.
            (i) Where the Industrial User's categorical Pretreatment Standard has been modified by a removal allowance (§ 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (§ 403.6(e)), and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (§ 403.13) at the time the User submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, the information required by paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits.
            (ii) If the categorical Pretreatment Standard is modified by a removal allowance (§ 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (§ 403.6(e)), and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (§ 403.13) after the User submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the User to the Control Authority within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.
            (c) Compliance schedule for meeting categorical Pretreatment Standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by paragraph (b)(7) of this section:
            (1) The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the Industrial User to meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
            (2) No increment referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall exceed 9 months.

            (3) Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the Industrial User shall submit a progress report to the Control Authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the Industrial User to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress reports to the Control Authority.
            
            (d) Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards or in the case of a New Source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any Industrial User subject to Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to the Control Authority a report containing the information described in paragraphs (b) (4)-(6) of this section. For Industrial Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Control Authority in accordance with the procedures in § 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long term production rate. For all other Industrial Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
            (e) Periodic reports on continued compliance. (1) Any Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard (except a Non-Significant Categorical User as defined in § 403.3(v)(2)), after the compliance date of such Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a New Source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Control Authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Control Authority or the Approval Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the Discharge reported in paragraph (b)(4) of this section except that the Control Authority may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the User shall submit documentation required by the Control Authority or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User. At the discretion of the Control Authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Control Authority may modify the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. For Industrial Users for which EPA or the authorized state, tribe, or territory is the Control Authority, as of December 21, 2020 all reports submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the industrial user to the Control Authority or initial recipient, as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b), in compliance with this section and 40 CFR part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to part 3), 40 CFR 122.22, and 40 CFR part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of part 127, the Industrial Users for which EPA or the authorized state, tribe, or territory is the Control Authority may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular control mechanism or if required to do so by state law.
            (2) The Control Authority may authorize the Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
            (i) The Control Authority may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.

            (ii) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the Permit or other equivalent individual control mechanism, but in no case longer than 5 years. The User must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism.
            (iii) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.
            The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section and include the certification statement in § 403.6(a)(2)(ii). Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
            (iv) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Control Authority must be included as a condition in the User's control mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Control Authority for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.

            (v) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's control mechanism by the Control Authority, the Industrial User must certify on each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User:
            
            
              Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR _______ [specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of ______ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1).
            
            
            (vi) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the User's operations, the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Control Authority; and notify the Control Authority.
            (vii) This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.
            (3) The Control Authority may reduce the requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Approval Authority, where the Industrial User meets all of the following conditions:
            (i) The Industrial User's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:
            (A) 0.01 percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of the POTW, or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the Industrial User discharges in batches;
            (B) 0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and
            (C) 0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard for which approved local limits were developed by a POTW in accordance with § 403.5(c) and paragraph (d) of this section;
            (ii) The Industrial User has not been in significant noncompliance, as defined in § 403.8(f)(2)(viii), for any time in the past two years;
            (iii) The Industrial User does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement for this Industrial User would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section;

            (iv) The Industrial User must notify the Control Authority immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section. Upon notification, the Industrial User must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and
            (v) The Control Authority must retain documentation to support the Control Authority's determination that a specific Industrial User qualifies for reduced reporting requirements under paragraph (e)(3) of this section for a period of 3 years after the expiration of the term of the control mechanism.
            (4) For Industrial Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Control Authority in accordance with the procedures in § 403.6(c), the report required by paragraph (e)(1) shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long term production rate. For all other Industrial Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by paragraph (e)(1) shall include the User's actual average production rate for the reporting period.
            (f) Notice of potential problems, including slug loading. All categorical and non-categorical Industrial Users shall notify the POTW immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined by § 403.5(b), by the Industrial User.
            (g) Monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance. (1) Except in the case of Non-Significant Categorical Users, the reports required in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (h) of this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the Discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Control Authority, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable Pretreatment Standards. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the Control Authority in lieu of the Industrial User. Where the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User, the User will not be required to submit the compliance certification required under paragraphs (b)(6) and (d) of this section. In addition, where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the Industrial User will not be required to submit the report.
            (2) If sampling performed by an Industrial User indicates a violation, the User shall notify the Control Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the Control Authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User, the Control Authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the User of the violation and requires the User to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if:
            (i) The Control Authority performs sampling at the Industrial User at a frequency of at least once per month; or
            (ii) The Control Authority performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the User or the Control Authority receives the results of this sampling.

            (3) The reports required in paragraphs (b), (d), (e) and (h) of this section must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The Control Authority shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by Industrial Users with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority, the samples must be representative of the Discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the Industrial User file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil & grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Control Authority, as appropriate.
            (4) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Control Authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs (e) and (h) of this section, the Control Authority shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by Industrial Users with Applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.

            (5) All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. (See, §§ 136.4 and 136.5.) Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the Administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator.
            (6) If an Industrial User subject to the reporting requirement in paragraph (e) or (h) of this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the Control Authority, using the procedures prescribed in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
            (h) Reporting requirements for Industrial Users not subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards. The Control Authority must require appropriate reporting from those Industrial Users with Discharges that are not subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards. Significant Non-categorical Industrial Users must submit to the Control Authority at least once every six months (on dates specified by the Control Authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the Control Authority. In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a Best Management Practice or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit documentation required by the Control Authority to determine the compliance status of the User. These reports must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in accordance with the techniques described in part 136 of this chapter and amendments thereto. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the Control Authority in lieu of the significant non-categorical Industrial User. For Industrial Users for which EPA or the authorized state, tribe, or territory is the Control Authority, as of December 21, 2020 all reports submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the industrial user to the Control Authority or initial recipient, as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b), in compliance with this section and 40 CFR part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to part 3), 40 CFR 122.22, and 40 CFR part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of part 127, the Industrial Users for which EPA or the authorized state, tribe, or territory is the Control Authority may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular control mechanism or if required to do so by state law.
            (i) Annual POTW reports. POTWs with approved Pretreatment Programs shall provide the Approval Authority with a report that briefly describes the POTW's program activities, including activities of all participating agencies, if more than one jurisdiction is involved in the local program. The report required by this section shall be submitted no later than one year after approval of the POTW's Pretreatment Program, and at least annually thereafter, and must include, at a minimum, the applicable required data in appendix A to 40 CFR part 127. The report required by this section must also include a summary of changes to the POTW's pretreatment program that have not been previously reported to the Approval Authority and any other relevant information requested by the Approval Authority. As of December 21, 2020 all annual reports submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the POTW Pretreatment Program to the Approval Authority or initial recipient, as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b), in compliance with this section and 40 CFR part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to part 3), 40 CFR 122.22, and 40 CFR part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of part 127, the Approval Authority may also require POTW Pretreatment Programs to electronically submit annual reports under this section if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.
            (1) An updated list of the POTW's Industrial Users, including their names and addresses, or a list of deletions and additions keyed to a previously submitted list. The POTW shall provide a brief explanation of each deletion. This list shall identify which Industrial Users are subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards and specify which Standards are applicable to each Industrial User. The list shall indicate which Industrial Users are subject to local standards that are more stringent than the categorical Pretreatment Standards. The POTW shall also list the Industrial Users that are subject only to local Requirements. The list must also identify Industrial Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards that are subject to reduced reporting requirements under paragraph (e)(3), and identify which Industrial Users are Non-Significant Categorical Industrial Users.
            (2) A summary of the status of Industrial User compliance over the reporting period;
            (3) A summary of compliance and enforcement activities (including inspections) conducted by the POTW during the reporting period;
            (4) A summary of changes to the POTW's pretreatment program that have not been previously reported to the Approval Authority; and
            (5) Any other relevant information requested by the Approval Authority.
            (j) Notification of changed Discharge. All Industrial Users shall promptly notify the Control Authority (and the POTW if the POTW is not the Control Authority) in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their Discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the Industrial User has submitted initial notification under paragraph (p) of this section.
            (k) Compliance schedule for POTW's. The following conditions and reporting requirements shall apply to the compliance schedule for development of an approvable POTW Pretreatment Program required by § 403.8.
            (1) The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the development and implementation of a POTW Pretreatment Program (e.g., acquiring required authorities, developing funding mechanisms, acquiring equipment);
            (2) No increment referred to in paragraph (k)(1) of this section shall exceed nine months;

            (3) Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the POTW shall submit a progress report to the Approval Authority including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps taken by the POTW to return to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the Approval Authority.
            (l) Signatory requirements for Industrial User reports. The reports required by paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section shall include the certification statement as set forth in § 403.6(a)(2)(ii), and shall be signed as follows:
            (1) By a responsible corporate officer, if the Industrial User submitting the reports required by paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section is a corporation. For the purpose of this paragraph, a responsible corporate officer means:

            (3) By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this section if:
            (i) The authorization is made in writing by the individual described in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2);
            (ii) The authorization specifies either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the Industrial Discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well, or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and
            (iii) the written authorization is submitted to the Control Authority.
            (4) If an authorization under paragraph (l)(3) of this section is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of paragraph (l)(3) of this section must be submitted to the Control Authority prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
            (m) Signatory requirements for POTW reports. Reports submitted to the Approval Authority by the POTW in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section must be signed by a principal executive officer, ranking elected official or other duly authorized employee. The duly authorized employee must be an individual or position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility or the Pretreatment Program. This authorization must be made in writing by the principal executive officer or ranking elected official, and submitted to the Approval Authority prior to or together with the report being submitted.
            (n) Provisions Governing Fraud and False Statements: The reports and other documents required to be submitted or maintained under this section shall be subject to:
            (1) The provisions of 18 U.S.C. section 1001 relating to fraud and false statements;

            (2) The provisions of sections 309(c)(4) of the Act, as amended, governing false statements, representation or certification; and
            
            (3) The provisions of section 309(c)(6) regarding responsible corporate officers.
            (o) Record-keeping requirements. (1) Any Industrial User and POTW subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section, including documentation associated with Best Management Practices. Such records shall include for all samples:
            (i) The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples;
            (ii) The dates analyses were performed;
            (iii) Who performed the analyses;
            (iv) The analytical techniques/methods use; and
            (v) The results of such analyses.
            (2) Any Industrial User or POTW subject to the reporting requirements established in this section (including documentation associated with Best Management Practices) shall be required to retain for a minimum of 3 years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this section) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the Director and the Regional Administrator (and POTW in the case of an Industrial User). This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the Industrial User or POTW or when requested by the Director or the Regional Administrator.
            (3) Any POTW to which reports are submitted by an Industrial User pursuant to paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (h) of this section shall retain such reports for a minimum of 3 years and shall make such reports available for inspection and copying by the Director and the Regional Administrator. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the Industrial User or the operation of the POTW Pretreatment Program or when requested by the Director or the Regional Administrator.
            (p)(1) The Industrial User shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the Industrial User discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the Industrial User: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve months. All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this rule. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12 (j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12 (b), (d), and (e).
            (2) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (p)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.

            Subsequent months during which the Industrial User discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
            (3) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the Industrial User must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
            (4) In the case of any notification made under paragraph (p) of this section, the Industrial User shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
            (q) Annual certification by Non-Significant Categorical Industrial Users. A facility determined to be a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User pursuant to § 403.3(v)(2) must annually submit the following certification statement, signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in paragraph (l) of this section. This certification must accompany any alternative report required by the Control Authority:
            
            
              Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR ____, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the period from ________ ____, to ________, ____ [month, days, year]:
              (a) The facility described as ________ [facility name] met the definition of a non-significant categorical Industrial User as described in § 403.3(v)(2); (b) the facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards and requirements during this reporting period; and (c) the facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period. This compliance certification is based upon the following information:
              
              
            
            
            (r) The Control Authority that chooses to receive electronic documents must satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).

            § 403.13
            Variances from categorical pretreatment standards for fundamentally different factors.
            (a) Definition. The term Requester means an Industrial User or a POTW or other interested person seeking a variance from the limits specified in a categorical Pretreatment Standard.
            (b) Purpose and scope. In establishing categorical Pretreatment Standards for existing sources, the EPA will take into account all the information it can collect, develop and solicit regarding the factors relevant to pretreatment standards under section 307(b). In some cases, information which may affect these Pretreatment Standards will not be available or, for other reasons, will not be considered during their development. As a result, it may be necessary on a case-by-case basis to adjust the limits in categorical Pretreatment Standards, making them either more or less stringent, as they apply to a certain Industrial User within an industrial category or subcategory. This will only be done if data specific to that Industrial User indicates it presents factors fundamentally different from those considered by EPA in developing the limit at issue. Any interested person believing that factors relating to an Industrial User are fundamentally different from the factors considered during development of a categorical Pretreatment Standard applicable to that User and further, that the existence of those factors justifies a different discharge limit than specified in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, may request a fundamentally different factors variance under this section or such a variance request may be initiated by the EPA.
            (c) Criteria—(1) General criteria. A request for a variance based upon fundamentally different factors shall be approved only if:
            
            (i) There is an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard which specifically controls the pollutant for which alternative limits have been requested; and
            (ii) Factors relating to the discharge controlled by the categorical Pretreatment Standard are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA in establishing the Standards; and
            (iii) The request for a variance is made in accordance with the procedural requirements in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
            (2) Criteria applicable to less stringent limits. A variance request for the establishment of limits less stringent than required by the Standard shall be approved only if:
            (i) The alternative limit requested is no less stringent than justified by the fundamental difference;
            (ii) The alternative limit will not result in a violation of prohibitive discharge standards prescribed by or established under § 403.5;
            (iii) The alternative limit will not result in a non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Pretreatment Standards; and
            (iv) Compliance with the Standards (either by using the technologies upon which the Standards are based or by using other control alternatives) would result in either:
            (A) A removal cost (adjusted for inflation) wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the Standards; or
            (B) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Standards.
            (3) Criteria applicable to more stringent limits. A variance request for the establishment of limits more stringent than required by the Standards shall be approved only if:
            (i) The alternative limit request is no more stringent than justified by the fundamental difference; and
            (ii) Compliance with the alternative limit would not result in either:
            (A) A removal cost (adjusted for inflation) wholly out of proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the Standards; or
            (B) A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impact considered during development of the Standards.
            (d) Factors considered fundamentally different. Factors which may be considered fundamentally different are:
            (1) The nature or quality of pollutants contained in the raw waste load of the User's process wastewater:
            (2) The volume of the User's process wastewater and effluent discharged;
            (3) Non-water quality environmental impact of control and treatment of the User's raw waste load;
            (4) Energy requirements of the application of control and treatment technology;
            (5) Age, size, land availability, and configuration as they relate to the User's equipment or facilities; processes employed; process changes; and engineering aspects of the application of control technology;
            (6) Cost of compliance with required control technology.
            (e) Factors which will not be considered fundamentally different. A variance request or portion of such a request under this section may not be granted on any of the following grounds:
            (1) The feasibility of installing the required waste treatment equipment within the time the Act allows;
            (2) The assertion that the Standards cannot be achieved with the appropriate waste treatment facilities installed, if such assertion is not based on factors listed in paragraph (d) of this section;
            (3) The User's ability to pay for the required waste treatment; or
            (4) The impact of a Discharge on the quality of the POTW's receiving waters.
            (f) State or local law. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the right of any state or locality under section 510 of the Act to impose more stringent limitations than required by Federal law.
            (g) Application deadline. (1) Requests for a variance and supporting information must be submitted in writing to the Director or to the Administrator (or his delegate), as appropriate.

            (2) In order to be considered, a request for a variance must be submitted no later than 180 days after the date on which a categorical Pretreatment Standard is published in the Federal Register.
            
            (3) Where the User has requested a categorical determination pursuant to § 403.6(a), the User may elect to await the results of the category determination before submitting a variance request under this section. Where the User so elects, he or she must submit the variance request within 30 days after a final decision has been made on the categorical determination pursuant to § 403.6(a)(4).
            (h) Contents submission. Written submissions for variance requests, whether made to the Administrator (or his delegate) or the Director, must include:
            (1) The name and address of the person making the request;
            (2) Identification of the interest of the Requester which is affected by the categorical Pretreatment Standard for which the variance is requested;
            (3) Identification of the POTW currently receiving the waste from the Industrial User for which alternative discharge limits are requested;
            (4) Identification of the categorical Pretreatment Standards which are applicable to the Industrial User;
            (5) A list of each pollutant or pollutant parameter for which an alternative discharge limit is sought;
            (6) The alternative discharge limits proposed by the Requester for each pollutant or pollutant parameter identified in paragraph (h)(5) of this section;
            (7) A description of the Industrial User's existing water pollution control facilities;
            (8) A schematic flow representation of the Industrial User's water system including water supply, process wastewater systems, and points of Discharge; and
            (9) A Statement of facts clearly establishing why the variance request should be approved, including detailed support data, documentation, and evidence necessary to fully evaluate the merits of the request, e.g., technical and economic data collected by the EPA and used in developing each pollutant discharge limit in the Pretreatment Standard.
            (i) Deficient requests. The Administrator (or his delegate) or the Director will only act on written requests for variances that contain all of the information required. Persons who have made incomplete submissions will be notified by the Administrator (or his delegate) or the Director that their requests are deficient and unless the time period is extended, will be given up to thirty days to remedy the deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within the time period allowed by the Administrator (or his delegate) or the Director, the request for a variance shall be denied.
            (j) Public notice. Upon receipt of a complete request, the Administrator (or his delegate) or the Director will provide notice of receipt, opportunity to review the submission, and opportunity to comment.
            (1) The public notice shall be circulated in a manner designed to inform interested and potentially interested persons of the request. Procedures for the circulation of public notice shall include mailing notices to:
            (i) The POTW into which the Industrial User requesting the variance discharges;
            (ii) Adjoining States whose waters may be affected; and
            (iii) Designated 208 planning agencies, Federal and State fish, shellfish and wildlife resource agencies; and to any other person or group who has requested individual notice, including those on appropriate mailing lists.
            (2) The public notice shall provide for a period not less than 30 days following the date of the public notice during which time interested persons may review the request and submit their written views on the request.

            (3) Following the comment period, the Administrator (or his delegate) or the Director will make a determination on the request taking into consideration any comments received. Notice of this final decision shall be provided to the requester (and the Industrial User for which the variance is requested if different), the POTW into which the Industrial User discharges and all persons who submitted comments on the request.
            
            (k) Review of requests by state. (1) Where the Director finds that fundamentally different factors do not exist, he may deny the request and notify the requester (and Industrial User where they are not the same) and the POTW of the denial.
            (2) Where the Director finds that fundamentally different factors do exist, he shall forward the request, with a recommendation that the request be approved, to the Administrator (or his delegate).
            (l) Review of requests by EPA. (1) Where the Administrator (or his delegate) finds that fundamentally different factors do not exist, he shall deny the request for a variance and send a copy of his determination to the Director, to the POTW, and to the requester (and to the Industrial User, where they are not the same).
            (2) Where the Administrator (or his delegate) finds that fundamentally different factors do exist, and that a partial or full variance is justified, he will approve the variance. In approving the variance, the Administrator (or his delegate) will:
            (i) Prepare recommended alternative discharge limits for the Industrial User either more or less stringent than those prescribed by the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard to the extent warranted by the demonstrated fundamentally different factors;
            (ii) Provide the following information in his written determination:
            (A) The recommended alternative discharge limits for the Industrial User concerned;
            (B) The rationale for the adjustment of the Pretreatment Standard (including the reasons for recommending that the variance be granted) and an explanation of how the recommended alternative discharge limits were derived;
            (C) The supporting evidence submitted to the Administrator (or his delegate); and
            (D) Other information considered by the Administrator (or his delegate) in developing the recommended alternative discharge limits;
            (iii) Notify the Director and the POTW of his or her determination; and
            (iv) Send the information described in paragraphs (l)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section to the Requestor (and to the Industrial User where they are not the same).
            (m) Request for hearing. (1) Within 30 days following the date of receipt of the notice of the decision of the Administrator's delegate on a variance request, the requester or any other interested person may submit a petition to the Regional Administrator for a hearing to reconsider or contest the decision. If such a request is submitted by a person other than the Industrial User the person shall simultaneously serve a copy of the request on the Industrial User.
            (2) If the Regional Administrator declines to hold a hearing and the Regional Administrator affirms the findings of the Administrator's delegate the requester may submit a petition for a hearing to the Environmental Appeals Board (which is described in § 1.25 of this title) within 30 days of the Regional Administrator's decision.

            § 403.14
            Confidentiality.
            (a) EPA authorities. In accordance with 40 CFR part 2, any information submitted to EPA pursuant to these regulations may be claimed as confidential by the submitter. Any such claim must be asserted at the time of submission in the manner prescribed on the application form or instructions, or, in the case of other submissions, by stamping the words “confidential business information” on each page containing such information. If no claim is made at the time of submission, EPA may make the information available to the public without further notice. If a claim is asserted, the information will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2 (Public Information).
            (b) Effluent data. Information and data provided to the Control Authority pursuant to this part which is effluent data shall be available to the public without restriction.
            (c) State or POTW. All other information which is submitted to the State or POTW shall be available to the public at least to the extent provided by 40 CFR 2.302.
          
          
            § 403.15
            Net/Gross calculation.
            (a) Application. Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the Industrial User's intake water in accordance with this section. Any Industrial User wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the Control Authority. Upon request of the Industrial User, the applicable Standard will be calculated on a “net” basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are met.
            (b) Criteria. (1) Either:
            (i) The applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or
            (ii) The Industrial User demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the Standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
            (2) Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the Industrial User demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the User's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
            (3) Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with Standard(s) adjusted under this section.
            (4) Credit shall be granted only if the User demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The Control Authority may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result.

            § 403.16
            Upset provision.
            (a) Definition. For the purposes of this section, Upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the Industrial User. An Upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
            (b) Effect of an upset. An Upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of paragraph (c) are met.
            (c) Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An Industrial User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of Upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
            (1) An Upset occurred and the Industrial User can identify the cause(s) of the Upset;
            (2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;
            (3) The Industrial User has submitted the following information to the POTW and Control Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the Upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
            (i) A description of the Indirect Discharge and cause of noncompliance;
            (ii) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue;
            (iii) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
            (d) Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the Industrial User seeking to establish the occurrence of an Upset shall have the burden of proof.
            (e) Reviewability of agency consideration of claims of upset. In the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, Agency enforcement personnel should review any claims that non-compliance was caused by an Upset. No determinations made in the course of the review constitute final Agency action subject to judicial review. Industrial Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of Upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards.
            (f) User responsibility in case of upset. The Industrial User shall control production or all Discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

            § 403.17
            Bypass.
            (a) Definitions. (1) Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an Industrial User's treatment facility.
            (2) Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
            (b) Bypass not violating applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. An Industrial User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
            (c) Notice. (1) If an Industrial User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Control Authority, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass.
            (2) An Industrial User shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards to the Control Authority within 24 hours from the time the Industrial User becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the Industrial User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Control Authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
            (d) Prohibition of bypass. (1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority may take enforcement action against an Industrial User for a bypass, unless;
            (i) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
            (ii) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
            (iii) The Industrial User submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section.
            (2) The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Control Authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

            § 403.18
            Modification of POTW pretreatment programs.
            (a) General. Either the Approval Authority or a POTW with an approved POTW Pretreatment Program may initiate program modification at any time to reflect changing conditions at the POTW. Program modification is necessary whenever there is a significant change in the operation of a POTW Pretreatment Program that differs from the information in the POTW's submission, as approved under § 403.11.
            (b) Substantial modifications defined. Substantial modifications include:
            (1) Modifications that relax POTW legal authorities (as described in § 403.8(f)(1)), except for modifications that directly reflect a revision to this part 403 or to 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, and are reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section;
            (2) Modifications that relax local limits, except for the modifications to local limits for pH and reallocations of the Maximum Allowable Industrial Loading of a pollutant that do not increase the total industrial loadings for the pollutant, which are reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. Maximum Allowable Industrial Loading means the total mass of a pollutant that all Industrial Users of a POTW (or a subgroup of Industrial Users identified by the POTW) may discharge pursuant to limits developed under § 403.5(c);
            (3) Changes to the POTW's control mechanism, as described in § 403.8(f)(1)(iii);
            (4) A decrease in the frequency of self-monitoring or reporting required of industrial users;
            (5) A decrease in the frequency of industrial user inspections or sampling by the POTW;
            (6) Changes to the POTW's confidentiality procedures; and
            (7) Other modifications designated as substantial modifications by the Approval Authority on the basis that the modification could have a significant impact on the operation of the POTW's Pretreatment Program; could result in an increase in pollutant loadings at the POTW; or could result in less stringent requirements being imposed on Industrial Users of the POTW.
            (c) Approval procedures for substantial modifications. (1) The POTW shall submit to the Approval Authority a statement of the basis for the desired program modification, a modified program description (see § 403.9(b)), or such other documents the Approval Authority determines to be necessary under the circumstances.
            (2) The Approval Authority shall approve or disapprove the modification based on the requirements of § 403.8(f) and using the procedures in § 403.11(b) through (f), except as provided in paragraphs (c) (3) and (4) of this section. The modification shall become effective upon approval by the Approval Authority.
            (3) The Approval Authority need not publish a notice of decision under § 403.11(e) provided: The notice of request for approval under § 403.11(b)(1) states that the request will be approved if no comments are received by a date specified in the notice; no substantive comments are received; and the request is approved without change.
            (4) Notices required by § 403.11 may be performed by the POTW provided that the Approval Authority finds that the POTW notice otherwise satisfies the requirements of § 403.11.
            (d) Approval procedures for non-substantial modifications. (1) The POTW shall notify the Approval Authority of any non-substantial modification at least 45 days prior to implementation by the POTW, in a statement similar to that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
            (2) Within 45 days after the submission of the POTW's statement, the Approval Authority shall notify the POTW of its decision to approve or disapprove the non-substantial modification.
            (3) If the Approval Authority does not notify the POTW within 45 days of its decision to approve or deny the modification, or to treat the modification as substantial under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the POTW may implement the modification.
            (e) Incorporation in permit. All modifications shall be incorporated into the POTW's NPDES permit upon approval. The permit will be modified to incorporate the approved modification in accordance with 40 CFR 122.63(g).

            § 403.19
            Provisions of specific applicability to the Owatonna Waste Water Treatment Facility.
            (a) For the purposes of this section, the term “Participating Industrial Users” includes the following Industrial Users in the City of Owatonna, Minnesota: Crown Cork and Seal Company, Inc.; Cybex International Inc.; Josten's Inc.—Southtown Facility; SPx Corporation, Service Solutions Division; Truth Hardware Corporation; and Uber Tanning Company.
            (b) For a Participating Industrial User discharging to the Owatonna Waste Water Treatment Facility in Owatonna, Minnesota, when a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed in terms of pollutant concentration the City of Owatonna may convert the limit to a mass limit by multiplying the five-year, long-term average process flows of the Participating Industrial User (or a shorter period if production has significantly increased or decreased during the five year period) by the concentration-based categorical Pretreatment Standard. Participating Industrial Users must notify the City in the event production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from a baseline production rate determined by Owatonna when it establishes a Participating Industrial User's initial mass limit. To remain eligible to receive equivalent mass limits the Participating Industrial User must maintain at least the same level of treatment as at the time the equivalent mass limit is established. Upon notification of a revised production rate from a Participating Industrial User, the City will reassess the appropriateness of the mass limit. Owatonna shall reestablish the concentration-based limit if a Participating Industrial User does not maintain at least the same level of treatment as when the equivalent mass limit was established.
            (c) If a categorical Participating Industrial User of the Owatonna Waste Water Treatment Facility has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors, including a comparison of three years of effluent data with background data, that pollutants regulated through categorical Pretreatment Standards, other than 40 CFR part 414, are not expected to be present in quantities greater than the background influent concentration to the industrial process, the City of Owatonna may reduce the sampling frequency specified in § 403.8(f)(2)(v) to once during the term of the categorical Participating Industrial User's permit.

            (d) If a Participating Industrial User is discharging to the Owatonna Waste Water Treatment Facility in Owatonna, Minnesota and is subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard other than one codified at 40 CFR part 414, the City of Owatonna may authorize the Participating Industrial User to forego sampling of a pollutant if the Participating Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors, including a comparison of three years of effluent data with background data, that the pollutant is not expected to be present in quantities greater than the background influent concentration to the industrial process, and the Participating Industrial User certifies on each report, with the following statement, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Participating Industrial User. The following statement is to be included as a comment to the periodic reports required by § 403.12(e):
            
            
              “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR __, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the raw materials, industrial processes, and potential by-products have not contributed this pollutant to the wastewaters since filing of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e).”
            
            

            (e) If the average daily loading from the Participating Industrial Users to the Owatonna Waste Water Treatment Facility is equal to or less than 0.68 pounds per day of chromium, 0.25 pounds per day of copper, 1.17 pounds per day of nickel, and 1.01 pounds per day of zinc, Owatonna may authorize a categorical Participating Industrial User to satisfy the reporting requirements of § 403.12(e) with an annual report provided on a date specified by Owatonna, provided that the Participating Industrial User has no reasonable potential to violate a Pretreatment Standard for any pollutant for which reduced monitoring is being allowed, and has not been in Significant Noncompliance within the previous three years.
            (f) The Owatonna Waste Water Treatment Facility in Owatonna, Minnesota shall post public notice of all Significant Noncompliance subject to the publication requirement in § 403.8(f)(2)(vii) at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency website for a period of one year, as soon as practicable upon identifying the violations. In addition, the Owatonna Waste Water Treatment Facility shall post an explanation of how Significant Noncompliance is determined, and a contact name and phone number for information regarding other, non-Significant Noncompliance violations. If a violation is not corrected within thirty (30) calendar days or results in pass through or interference at the Owatonna Waste Water Treatment Facility, publication must also be made in the format specified in § 403.8(f)(2)(vii).
            (g) The provisions of this section shall expire on October 6, 2005.

            § 403.20
            Pretreatment Program Reinvention Pilot Projects Under Project XL.
            The Approval Authority may allow any publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that has a final “Project XL” agreement to implement a Pretreatment Program that includes legal authorities and requirements that are different than the administrative requirements otherwise applicable under this part. The POTW must submit any such alternative requirements as a substantial program modification in accordance with the procedures outlined in § 403.18. The approved modified program must be incorporated as an enforceable part of the POTW's NPDES permit. The Approval Authority must include a reopener clause in the POTW's NPDES permit that directs the POTW to discontinue implementing the approved alternative requirements and resume implementation of its previously approved pretreatment program if the Approval Authority determines that the primary objectives of the Local Pilot Pretreatment Program are not being met or the “Project XL” agreement expires or is otherwise terminated.

            Appendix D to Part 403—Selected Industrial Subcategories Considered Dilute for Purposes of the Combined Wastestream Formula
            The following industrial subcategories are considered to have dilute wastestreams for purposes of the combined wastestream formula. They either were or could have been excluded from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to paragraph 8 of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., et al. v. Costle Consent Decree for one or more of the following four reasons: (1) The pollutants of concern are not detectable in the effluent from the industrial user (paragraph 8(a)(iii)); (2) the pollutants of concern are present only in trace amounts and are neither causing nor likely to cause toxic effects (paragraph 8(a)(iii)); (3) the pollutants of concern are present in amounts too small to be effectively reduced by technologies known to the Administrator (paragraph 8(a)(iii)); or (4) the wastestream contains only pollutants which are compatible with the POTW (paragraph 8(b)(i)). In some instances, different rationales were given for exclusion under paragraph 8. However, EPA has reviewed these subcategories and has determined that exclusion could have occurred due to one of the four reasons listed above.
            This list is complete as of October 9, 1986. It will be updated periodically for the convenience of the reader.

            Appendix E to Part 403—Sampling Procedures
            I. Composite Method

            A. It is recommended that influent and effluent operational data be obtained through 24-hour flow proportional composite samples. Sampling may be done manually or automatically, and discretely or continuously. If discrete sampling is employed, at least 12 aliquots should be composited. Discrete sampling may be flow proportioned either by varying the time interval between each aliquot or the volume of each aliquot. All composites should be flow proportional to either the stream flow at the time of collection of the influent aliquot or to the total influent flow since the previous influent aliquot. Volatile pollutant aliquots must be combined in the laboratory immediately before analysis.
            B. Effluent sample collection need not be delayed to compensate for hydraulic detention unless the POTW elects to include detention time compensation or unless the Approval Authority requires detention time compensation. The Approval Authority may require that each effluent sample is taken approximately one detention time later than the corresponding influent sample when failure to do so would result in an unrepresentative portrayal of actual POTW operation. The detention period should be based on a 24-hour average daily flow value. The average daily flow should in turn be based on the average of the daily flows during the same month of the previous year.
            II. Grab Method
            If composite sampling is not an appropriate technique, grab samples should be taken to obtain influent and effluent operational data. A grab sample is an individual sample collected over a period of time not exceeding 15 minutes. The collection of influent grab samples should precede the collection of effluent samples by approximately one detention period except that where the detention period is greater than 24 hours such staggering of the sample collection may not be necessary or appropriate. The detention period should be based on a 24-hour average daily flow value. The average daily flow should in turn be based upon the average of the daily flows during the same month of the previous year. Grab sampling should be employed where the pollutants being evaluated are those, such as cyanide and phenol, which may not be held for an extended period because of biological, chemical or physical interaction which take place after sample collection and affect the results.

              (a) Process waste water shall not be discharged to a POTW at a flow rate or pollutant mass loading rate which is excessive over any time period during the peak load at a POTW. Excessive discharges are defined as those in which the flow of BOD5 or total suspended solids (TSS) exceed the respective values of P from the following formula:
              
              P = K(Q + R)−S

                P = maximum allowable peak waste load for the new corn wet milling source to be discharged to the POTW (gallons per one hour for flow and pounds per day for BOD5 and TSS).
                Q = average existing waste load to POTW.
                R = average waste load for the new corn wet milling source to be discharged to POTW.
                S = existing peak load of POTW.
                K = 2. When the ratio of (S/Q) is greater than 1.5, K = 3.

              § 407.72
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

              (a) The following limitations establish the quantity of BOD5 controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a “medium” or “large” existing point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best practicable control technology currently available. Any vegetable processing plant which continuously or intermittently discharges process waste water during the processing season shall meet the annual average, maximum thirty day average, and maximum day BOD5 limitations. Vegetable processing plants employing long term waste stabilization, where all or a portion of the process waste water discharge is stored for the entire processing season and released at a controlled rate with State approval, shall meet only the annual average BOD5 limitations. The effluent limitations do not apply to single-commodity 100 percent canned corn processing plants of all sizes, and multi-commodity 100 percent frozen vegetable processing plants with total annual raw material production less than 7,264 kkg (8,000 tons) per year.

              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the processing of bottom fish outside of Alaska in which the unit operations are carried out predominately through manual methods. However, the use of scaling machines and/or skinning machines are considered to be normal practice within this subcategory. The provisions of this subpart apply to the processing of currently, commercially processed species of bottom fish such as flounder, ocean perch, haddock, cod, sea catfish, sole, halibut, and rockfish. These provisions apply to existing facilities processing more than 1816 kg (4000 lbs) of raw material per day on any day during a calendar year and all new sources.

              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

              (a) Any liquid cane sugar refinery discharging both barometric condenser cooling water and other process waters shall meet the following limitations. The BOD5 limitation is determined by the addition of the net BOD5 attributed to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BOD5 attributed to the treated process water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributed to the treated process water. Where the barometric condenser cooling water and process water streams are mixed and impossible to measure separately prior to discharge, the values should be considered net.

            § 412.3
            General pretreatment standards.
            Any source subject to this part that introduces process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) must comply with 40 CFR part 403.
          
          
            § 412.4
            Best management practices (BMPs) for land application of manure, litter, and process wastewater.
            (a) Applicability. This section applies to any CAFO subject to subpart C of this part (Dairy and Beef Cattle other than Veal Calves) or subpart D of this part (Swine, Poultry, and Veal Calves).
            (b) Specialized definitions. (1) Setback means a specified distance from surface waters or potential conduits to surface waters where manure, litter, and process wastewater may not be land applied. Examples of conduits to surface waters include but are not limited to: Open tile line intake structures, sinkholes, and agricultural well heads.
            (2) Vegetated buffer means a narrow, permanent strip of dense perennial vegetation established parallel to the contours of and perpendicular to the dominant slope of the field for the purposes of slowing water runoff, enhancing water infiltration, and minimizing the risk of any potential nutrients or pollutants from leaving the field and reaching surface waters.
            (3) Multi-year phosphorus application means phosphorus applied to a field in excess of the crop needs for that year. In multi-year phosphorus applications, no additional manure, litter, or process wastewater is applied to the same land in subsequent years until the applied phosphorus has been removed from the field via harvest and crop removal.
            (c) Requirement to develop and implement best management practices. Each CAFO subject to this section that land applies manure, litter, or process wastewater, must do so in accordance with the following practices:
            (1) Nutrient Management Plan. The CAFO must develop and implement a nutrient management plan that incorporates the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) of this section based on a field-specific assessment of the potential for nitrogen and phosphorus transport from the field and that addresses the form, source, amount, timing, and method of application of nutrients on each field to achieve realistic production goals, while minimizing nitrogen and phosphorus movement to surface waters.
            (2) Determination of application rates. Application rates for manure, litter, and other process wastewater applied to land under the ownership or operational control of the CAFO must minimize phosphorus and nitrogen transport from the field to surface waters in compliance with the technical standards for nutrient management established by the Director. Such technical standards for nutrient management shall:
            (i) Include a field-specific assessment of the potential for nitrogen and phosphorus transport from the field to surface waters, and address the form, source, amount, timing, and method of application of nutrients on each field to achieve realistic production goals, while minimizing nitrogen and phosphorus movement to surface waters; and
            (ii) Include appropriate flexibilities for any CAFO to implement nutrient management practices to comply with the technical standards, including consideration of multi-year phosphorus application on fields that do not have a high potential for phosphorus runoff to surface water, phased implementation of phosphorus-based nutrient management, and other components, as determined appropriate by the Director.
            (3) Manure and soil sampling. Manure must be analyzed a minimum of once annually for nitrogen and phosphorus content, and soil analyzed a minimum of once every five years for phosphorus content. The results of these analyses are to be used in determining application rates for manure, litter, and other process wastewater.
            (4) Inspect land application equipment for leaks. The operator must periodically inspect equipment used for land application of manure, litter, or process wastewater.
            (5) Setback requirements. Unless the CAFO exercises one of the compliance alternatives provided for in paragraph (c)(5)(i) or (c)(5)(ii) of this section, manure, litter, and process wastewater may not be applied closer than 100 feet to any down-gradient surface waters, open tile line intake structures, sinkholes, agricultural well heads, or other conduits to surface waters.
            (i) Vegetated buffer compliance alternative. As a compliance alternative, the CAFO may substitute the 100-foot setback with a 35-foot wide vegetated buffer where applications of manure, litter, or process wastewater are prohibited.
            (ii) Alternative practices compliance alternative. As a compliance alternative, the CAFO may demonstrate that a setback or buffer is not necessary because implementation of alternative conservation practices or field-specific conditions will provide pollutant reductions equivalent or better than the reductions that would be achieved by the 100-foot setback.

              § 412.46
              New source performance standards (NSPS).
              Any new source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of NSPS:
              (a) For CAFO production areas. There must be no discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater pollutants into waters of the U.S. from the production area, subject to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
              (1) Any CAFO subject to this subpart may request that the Director establish NPDES permit best management practice effluent limitations designed to ensure no discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater based upon a site-specific evaluation of the CAFO's open surface manure storage structure. The NPDES permit best management practice effluent limitations must address the CAFO's entire production area. In the case of any CAFO using an open surface manure storage structure for which the Director establishes such effluent limitations, “no discharge of manure, litter, or process wastewater pollutants,” as used in this section, means that the storage structure is designed, operated, and maintained in accordance with best management practices established by the Director on a site-specific basis after a technical evaluation of the storage structure. The technical evaluation must address the following elements:
              (i) Information to be used in the design of the open manure storage structure including, but not limited to, the following: minimum storage periods for rainy seasons, additional minimum capacity for chronic rainfalls, applicable technical standards that prohibit or otherwise limit land application to frozen, saturated, or snow-covered ground, planned emptying and dewatering schedules consistent with the CAFO's Nutrient Management Plan, additional storage capacity for manure intended to be transferred to another recipient at a later time, and any other factors that would affect the sizing of the open manure storage structure.
              (ii) The design of the open manure storage structure as determined by the most recent version of the National Resource Conservation Service's Animal Waste Management (AWM) software. CAFOs may use equivalent design software or procedures as approved by the Director.
              (iii) All inputs used in the open manure storage structure design including actual climate data for the previous 30 years consisting of historical average monthly precipitation and evaporation values, the number and types of animals, anticipated animal sizes or weights, any added water and bedding, any other process wastewater, and the size and condition of outside areas exposed to rainfall and contributing runoff to the open manure storage structure.

              (iv) The planned minimum period of storage in months including, but not limited to, the factors for designing an open manure storage structure listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Alternatively the CAFO may determine the minimum period of storage by specifying times the storage pond will be emptied consistent with the CAFO's Nutrient Management Plan.
              (v) Site-specific predicted design specifications including dimensions of the storage facility, daily manure and wastewater additions, the size and characteristics of the land application areas, and the total calculated storage period in months.
              (vi) An evaluation of the adequacy of the designed manure storage structure using the most recent version of the Soil Plant Air Water (SPAW) Hydrology Tool. The evaluation must include all inputs to SPAW including but not limited to daily precipitation, temperature, and evaporation data for the previous 100 years, user-specified soil profiles representative of the CAFO's land application areas, planned crop rotations consistent with the CAFO's Nutrient Management Plan, and the final modeled result of no overflows from the designed open manure storage structure. For those CAFOs where 100 years of local weather data for the CAFO's location is not available, CAFOs may use a simulation with a confidence interval analysis conducted over a period of 100 years. The Director may approve equivalent evaluation and simulation procedures.
              (vii) The Director may waive the requirement of (a)(1)(vi) for a site-specific evaluation of the designed manure storage structure and instead authorize a CAFO to use a technical evaluation developed for a class of specific facilities within a specified geographical area.
              (viii) Waste management and storage facilities designed, constructed, operated, and maintained consistent with the analysis conducted in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vii) of this section and operated in accordance with the additional measures and records required by § 412.47(a) and (b), will fulfill the requirements of this section.
              (ix) The Director has the discretion to request additional information to support a request for effluent limitations based on a site-specific open surface manure storage structure.
              (2) The production area must be operated in accordance with the additional measures required by § 412.47(a) and (b).
              (3) Provisions for upset/bypass, as provided in 40 CFR 122.41(m)-(n), apply to a new source subject to this provision.

              (b) In requesting that no monitoring be required industrial users of POTWs shall submit a toxic organic management plan that specifies to the control authority's satisfaction the toxic organic compounds used; the method of disposal used instead of dumping, such as reclamation, contract hauling, or incineration; and procedures for assuring that toxic organics do not routinely spill or leak into the wastewater.
              (c) If monitoring is necessary to measure compliance with the TTO standard the industrial user need analyze only for those pollutants which would reasonably be expected to be present.

              General definitions.
              As used in this part:
              (a) Except as provided in this regulation, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in part 401 of this chapter shall apply to this part.
              (b) Pretreatment control authority means:
              (1) The POTW if the POTW's submission for its pretreatment program has been approved in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 403.11, or
              (2) The Approval Authority if the submission has not been approved.
              (c) Priority pollutants means the toxic pollutants listed in 40 CFR 401.15.
            
            
              § 414.11
              Applicability.
              (a) The provisions of this part are applicable to process wastewater discharges from all establishments or portions of establishments that manufacture the organic chemicals, plastics, and synthetic fibers (OCPSF) products or product groups covered by subparts B through H of this regulation and are included within the following U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) major groups:
              (1) SIC 2821—Plastic Materials, Synthetic Resins, and Nonvulcanizable Elastomers,
              (2) SIC 2823—Cellulosic Man-Made Fibers,
              (3) SIC 2824—Synthetic Organic Fibers, Except Cellulosic,
              (4) SIC 2865—Cyclic Crudes and Intermediates, Dyes, and Organic Pigments,
              (5) SIC 2869—Industrial Organic Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified.
              (b) The provisions of this part are applicable to wastewater discharges from OCPSF research and development, pilot plant, technical service and laboratory bench scale operations if such operations are conducted in conjunction with and related to existing OCPSF manufacturing activities at the plant site.
              (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the provisions of this part are not applicable to discharges resulting from the manufacture of OCPSF products if the products are included in the following SIC subgroups and have in the past been reported by the establishment under these subgroups and not under the SIC groups listed in paragraph (a) of this section:
              (1) SIC 2843085—bulk surface active agents;
              (2) SIC 28914—synthetic resin and rubber adhesives;
              (3) Chemicals and Chemical Preparations, not Elsewhere Classified:
              (i) SIC 2899568—sizes, all types

              (ii) SIC 2899597—other industrial chemical specialties, including fluxes, plastic wood preparations, and embalming fluids;
              (4) SIC 2911058—aromatic hydrocarbons manufactured from purchased refinery products; and
              (5) SIC 2911632—aliphatic hydrocarbons manufactured from purchased refinery products.
              (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the provisions of this part are not applicable to any discharges for which a different set of previously promulgated effluent limitations guidelines and standards in this subchapter apply, unless the facility reports OCPSF products under SIC codes 2865, 2869, or 2821, and the facility's OCPSF wastewaters are treated in a separate treatment system or discharged separately to a publicly owned treatment works.
              (e) The provisions of this part do not apply to any process wastewater discharges from the manufacture of organic chemical compounds solely by extraction from plant and animal raw materials or by fermentation processes.
              (f) Discharges of chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc in “complexed metal-bearing waste streams,” listed in appendix B of this part, are not subject to the requirements of this part.
              (g) Non-amenable cyanide. Discharges of cyanide in “cyanide-bearing waste streams” (listed in appendix A to this part) are not subject to the cyanide limitations and standards of this part if the permit writer or control authority determines that the cyanide limitations and standards are not achievable due to elevated levels of non-amenable cyanide (i.e., cyanide that is not oxidized by chlorine treatment) that result from the unavoidable complexing of cyanide at the process source of the cyanide-bearing waste stream and establishes an alternative total cyanide or amenable cyanide limitation that reflects the best available technology economically achievable. The determination must be based upon a review of relevant engineering, production, and sampling and analysis information, including measurements of both total and amenable cyanide in the waste stream. An analysis of the extent of complexing in the waste stream, based on the foregoing information, and its impact on cyanide treatability shall be set forth in writing and, for direct dischargers, be contained in the fact sheet required by 40 CFR 124.8.
              (h) Allowances for non-metal-bearing waste streams. Discharge limitations for chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc or discharge standards for lead and zinc may be established for waste streams not listed in appendix A of this part and not otherwise determined to be “metal-bearing waste streams” if the permit writer or control authority determines that the wastewater metals contamination is due to background levels that are not reasonably avoidable from sources such as intake water, corrosion of construction materials or contamination of raw materials. The determination must be based upon a review of relevant plant operating conditions, process chemistry, engineering, and sampling and analysis information. An analysis of the sources and levels of the metals, based on the foregoing information, shall be set forth in writing; for direct dischargers, the analysis shall be contained in the fact sheet required by 40 CFR 124.8. For direct dischargers, the permit writer may establish limitations for chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc for non-“metal-bearing waste streams” between the lowest level which the permit writer determines based on best professional judgment can be reliably measured and the concentrations of such metals present in the wastestreams, but not to exceed the applicable limitations contained in §§ 414.91 and 414.101. (For zinc, the applicable limitations which may not be exceeded are those appearing in the tables in §§ 414.91 and 414.101, not the alternative limitations for rayon fiber manufacture by the viscose process and the acrylic fiber manufacture by the zinc chloride/solvent process set forth in footnote 2 to each of these tables.) For indirect dischargers, the control authority may establish standards for lead and zinc for non-“metal-bearing waste streams” between the lowest level which the control authority determines based on best professional judgment can be reliably measured and the concentration of such metals present in the wastestreams, but not to exceed the applicable standards contained in §§ 414.25, 414.35, 414.45, 414.55, 414.65, 414.75, and 414.85. (For zinc, the applicable standards which may not be exceeded are those appearing in the tables in the above referenced sections, not the alternative standards for rayon filber manufacture by the viscose process set forth in footnote 2 to the table in § 414.25, or the alternative standards for acrylic fiber manufacture by the zinc chloride/solvent process set forth in footnote 2 to the table in § 414.35.) The limitations and standards for individual dischargers shall be set on a mass basis by multiplying the concentration allowance established by the permit writer or control authority by the process wastewater flow from the individual wastestreams for which incidental metals have been found to be present.
              (i) BOD5 and TSS limitations for plants with production in two or more subcategories. Any existing or new source direct discharge point source subject to two or more of subparts B through H must achieve BOD5 and TSS discharges not exceeding the quantity (mass) determined by multiplying the total OCPSF process wastewater flow subject to subparts B through H times the following “OCPSF production-proportioned concentration”: For a specific plant, let wj be the proportion of the plant's total OCPSF production in subcategory j. Then the plant-specific production-proportioned concentration limitations are given by:
              
                EC15NO91.016
              
              The “BOD5 Limitj” and “TSS Limitj” are the respective subcategorical BOD5 and TSS Maximum for Any One Day or Maximum for Monthly Average limitations.

              Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).
              (a) The Agency has determined that for existing point sources whose total OCPSF production defined by § 414.11 is less than or equal to five (5) million pounds of OCPSF products per year, the BPT level of treatment is the best available technology economically achievable. Accordingly, the Agency is not promulgating more stringent BAT limitations for these point sources.
              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section and in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source that uses end-of-pipe biological treatment and is subject to this subpart must achieve discharges in accordance with § 414.91 of this part.
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section and in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source that does not use end-of-pipe biological treatment and is subject to this subpart must achieve discharges in accordance with § 414.101 of this part.

              § 414.90
              Applicability; description of the subcategory of direct discharge point sources that use end-of-pipe biological treatment.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to the process wastewater discharges resulting from the manufacture of the OCPSF products and product groups defined by § 414.11 from any point source that uses end-of-pipe biological treatment or installs end-of-pipe biological treatment to comply with BPT effluent limitations.
            
            
              § 414.91
              Toxic pollutant effluent limitations and standards for direct discharge point sources that use end-of-pipe biological treatment.
              (a) Any point source subject to this subpart must achieve discharges not exceeding the quantity (mass) determined by multiplying the process wastewater flow subject to this subpart times the concentrations in the following table.
              (b) In the case of chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and total cyanide, the discharge quantity (mass) shall be determined by multiplying the concentrations listed in the following table for these pollutants times the flow from metal-bearing waste streams for the metals and times the flow from cyanide bearing waste streams for total cyanide. The metal-bearing waste streams and cyanide-bearing waste streams are defined as those waste streams listed in appendix A of this part, plus any additional OCPSF process wastewater streams identified by the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis as metal or cyanide bearing based upon a determination that such streams contain significant amounts of the pollutants identified above. Any such streams designated as metal or cyanide bearing must be treated independently of other metal or cyanide bearing waste streams unless the permitting authority determines that the combination of such streams, prior to treatment, with the appendix A waste streams will result in substantial reduction of these pollutants. This determination must be based upon a review of relevant engineering, production, and sampling and analysis information.

            Subpart J—Direct Discharge Point Sources That Do Not Use End-of-Pipe Biological Treatment
            
              § 414.100
              Applicability; description of the subcategory of direct discharge point sources that do not use end-of-pipe biological treatment.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to the process wastewater discharges resulting from the manufacture of the OCPSF products and product groups defined by § 414.11 from any point source that does not use end-of-pipe biological treatment and does not install end-of-pipe biological treatment to comply with BPT effluent limitations.
            
            
              § 414.101
              Toxic pollutant effluent limitations and standards for direct discharge point sources that do not use end-of-pipe biological treatment.
              (a) Any point source subject to this subpart must achieve discharges not exceeding the quantity (mass) determined by multiplying the process wastewater flow subject to this subpart times the concentartions in the following table.
              (b) In the case of chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and total cyanide, the discharge quantity (mass) shall be determined by multiplying the concentrations listed in the following table for these pollutants times the flow from metal bearing waste streams for the metals and times the cyanide-bearing waste streams for total cyanide. The metal-bearing waste streams and cyanide-bearing waste streams are defined as those waste streams listed in appendix A of this part, plus any additional OCPSF process wastewater streams identified by the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis as metal or cyanide bearing based upon a determination that such streams contain significant amounts of the pollutants identified above. Any such streams designated as metal or cyanide bearing must be treated independently of other metal or cyanide bearing waste streams unless the permitting authority determines that the combination of such streams, prior to treatment, with the Appendix A waste streams will result in substantial reduction of these pollutants. This determination must be based upon a review of relevant engineering, production, and sampling and analysis information.

              § 414.110
              Applicability; description of the subcategory of indirect discharge point sources.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to the process wastewater discharges resulting from the manufacture of the OCPSF products and product groups defined by § 414.11 from any indirect discharge point source.
            
            
              § 414.111
              Toxic pollutant standards for indirect discharge point sources.
              (a) Any point source subject to this subpart must achieve discharges not exceeding the quantity (mass) determined by multiplying the process wastewater flow subject to this subpart times the concentration listed in the following table.
              (b) In the case of lead, zinc, and total cyanide the discharge quantity (mass) shall be determined by multiplying the concentrations listed in the following table for these pollutants times the flow from metal-bearing waste streams for metals and times the flow from the cyanide-bearing waste streams for total cyanide. The metal-bearing waste streams and cyanide-bearing waste streams are defined as those waste streams listed in appendix A of this part, plus any additional OCPSF process wastewater streams identified by the control authority on a case-by-case basis as metal or cyanide bearing based upon a determination that such streams contain significant amounts of the pollutants identified above. Any such streams designated as metal or cyanide bearing must be treated independently of other metal or cyanide bearing waste streams unless the control authority determines that the combination of such streams, prior to treatment, with the appendix A waste streams will result in substantial reduction of these pollutants. This determination must be based upon a review of relevant engineering, production, and sampling and analysis information.

              § 417.150
              Applicability; description of the manufacture of spray dried detergents subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from all operations associated with the manufacture of spray dried detergents, including but not limited to assembly and storage of raw materials, crutching, spray drying, blending (including tumble spraying of additives) and packaging.
            
            
              § 417.151
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term anhydrous product shall mean the theoretical product that would result if all water were removed from the actual product.
              (c) The term surfactant shall mean those methylene blue active substances amenable to measurement by the method described in “Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,” 1971, Environmental Protection Agency, Analytical Quality Control Laboratory, page 131.
              (d) The term normal operation of a spray tower shall mean operation utilizing formulations that present limitted air quality problems from stack gases and associated need for extensive wet scrubbing, and without more than 6 turnarounds in a 30 consecutive day period, thus permitting essentially complete recycle of waste water.
              (e) The term air quality restricted operation of a spray tower shall mean an operation utilizing formulations (e.g., those with high non-ionic content) which require a very high rate of wet scrubbing to maintain desirable quality of stack gases, and thus generate much greater quantities of waste water than can be recycled to process.
              (f) The term fast turnaround operation of a spray drying tower shall mean operation involving more than 6 changes of formulation in a 30 consecutive day period that are of such degree and type (e.g., high phosphate to no phosphate) as to require cleaning of the tower to maintain minimal product quality.
              (g) The term BOD7 shall mean the biochemical oxygen demand as determined by incubation at 20 degrees C for a period of 7 days using an acclimated seed. Agitation employing a magnetic stirrer set at 200 to 500 rpm may be used.

              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term process wastewater means any water which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product, or waste product. The term “process wastewater” does not include contaminated non-process wastewater, as defined below.
              (c) The term, contaminated non-process wastewater shall mean any water including precipitation runoff which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into incidental contact with any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product or waste product by means of: (1) Precipitation runoff; (2) accidental spills; (3) accidental leaks caused by the failure of process equipment and which are repaired or the discharge of pollutants therefrom contained or terminated within the shortest reasonable time which shall not exceed 24 hours after discovery or when discovery should reasonably have been made, whichever is earliest; and (4) discharges from safety showers and related personal safety equipment, and from equipment washings for the purpose of safe entry, inspection and maintenance; provided that all reasonable measures have been taken to prevent, reduce, eliminate and control to the maximum extent feasible such contact and provided further that all reasonable measures have been taken that will mitigate the effects of such contact once it has occurred.
              (d) The term ten-year 24-hour rainfall event shall mean the maximum 24-hour precipitation event with a probable recurrence interval of once in 10 years as defined by the National Weather Service in technical paper No. 40, “Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States”, May 1961, and subsequent amendments in effect as of the effective date of this regulation.
              (e) The term 25-year 24-hour rainfall event shall mean the maximum 24-hour precipitation event with a probable recurrence interval of once in 25 years as defined by the National Weather Service in technical paper No. 40, “Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States”, May 1961, and subsequent amendments in effect, as of the effective date of this regulation.
              (f) The term calcium sulfate storage pile runoff shall mean the calcium sulfate transport water runoff from or through the calcium sulfate pile, and the precipitation which falls directly on the storage pile and which may be collected in a seepage ditch at the base of the outer slopes of the storage pile, provided such seepage ditch is protected from the incursion of surface runoff from areas outside of the outer perimeter of the seepage ditch.

              (c) The provisions of § 419.12(c) apply to discharges of process wastewater pollutants attributable to ballast water by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (d) The quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph, attributable to once-through cooling water, are excluded from the discharge allowed by paragraph (b) of this section. Once-through cooling water may be discharged with a total organic carbon concentration not to exceed 5 mg/l.
              (e) Effluent limitations for contaminated runoff. The following effluent limitations constitute the quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph and attributable to contaminated runoff, which may be discharged after the application of the best practicable control technology currently available by a point source subject to this subpart.
              (1) If wastewater consists solely of contaminated runoff and is not commingled or treated with process wastewater, it may be discharged if it does not exceed 15 mg/l oil and grease and 110 mg/l total organic carbon (TOC) based upon an analysis of any single grab or composite sample.
              (2) If contaminated runoff is commingled or treated with process wastewater, or if wastewater consisting solely of contaminated runoff which exceeds 15 mg/l oil and grease or 110 mg/l TOC is not commingled or treated with any other type of wastewater, the quantity of pollutants discharged shall not exceed the quantity determined by multiplying the flow of contaminated runoff as determined by the permit writer times the concentrations listed in the following table:

              (ii) Existing monitoring data relating to discharges to and from the central treatment facility including pollutant concentrations, flows and mass loadings; As a minimum, monitoring data should be provided for a six month period of normal operation of the production and treatment facilities. The complete data as well as a data summary including the maximum, minimum, and mean gross discharge loadings and the standard deviation of the discharge loadings for each monitored pollutant should be provided. Any supplemental monitoring data for toxic pollutants should also be provided.
              (iii) A scale map of the area of the plant served by the wastewater treatment facility, including the treatment facility and water supply and discharge points;

              (iv) An estimate of the least costly investment required to meet the generally applicable limitations or standards for the facility and a description of such treatment system including schematic diagrams showing the major treatment system components and flow rates through the system. As a minimum, the cost estimates should be comprised of a single page summary for each water pollution control system showing estimated installed direct cost totals for mechanical equipment; piping and instrumentation; foundations and structural components; and, electrical components. Indirect costs for contingencies, overhead and profit, engineering fees, and any other indirect costs must be itemized separately. The sum of the direct and indirect costs which represents the owner's or operator's total estimate, must be shown.
              (v) The effluent limitations or standards which could be achieved if the discharger were to spend an amount equal to the Agency's model treatment system cost estimate for the facility and the treatment facilities which would be used to meet those limitations or standards.

              Specialized definitions.
              As used in this subpart:
              (a) For the sintering subcategory, the term product means sinter agglomerated from iron-bearing materials.
              (b) The term dry air pollution control system means an emission control system that utilizes filters to remove iron-bearing particles (fines) from blast furnace or sintering off-gases.
              (c) The term minimum level (ML) means the level at which the analytical system gives recognizable signals and an acceptable calibration point. For 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran, the minimum level is 10 pg/L per EPA Method 1613B for water and wastewater samples.
              (d) The term pg/L means picograms per liter (ppt = 1.0 × 10-12 gm/L).
              (e) The term sintering means a process for agglomerating iron-bearing materials into small pellets (sinter) that can be charged to a blast furnace.
              (f) The term wet air pollution control system means an emission control system that utilizes water to clean process or furnace off-gases.

              § 420.70
              Applicability; description of the hot forming subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges and to the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works resulting from hot forming operations conducted in primary, section, flat, and pipe and tube mills.
            
            
              § 420.71
              Specialized definitions.
              (a) The term hot forming means those steel operations in which solidified, heated steel is shaped by rolls.
              (b) The term primary mill means those steel hot forming operations that reduce ingots to blooms or slabs by passing the ingots between rotating steel rolls. The first hot forming operation performed on solidified steel after it is removed from the ingot molds is carried out on a “primary mill”.
              (c) The term section mill means those steel hot forming operations that produce a variety of finished and semi-finished steel products other than the products of those mills specified below in paragraphs (d), (e), (g), and (h) of this section.
              (d) The term flat mill means those steel hot forming operations that reduce heated slabs to plates, strip and sheet, or skelp.
              (e) The term pipe and tube mill means those steel hot forming operations that produce butt welded or seamless tubular steel products.
              (f) The term scarfing means those steel surface conditioning operations in which flames generated by the combustion of oxygen and fuel are used to remove surface metal imperfections from slabs, billets, or blooms.
              (g) The term plate mill means those steel hot forming operations that produce flat hot-rolled products which are (1) between 8 and 48 inches wide and over 0.23 inches thick; or (2) greater than 48 inches wide and over 0.18 inches thick.
              (h) The term hot strip and sheet mill means those steel hot forming operations that produce flat hot-rolled products other than plates.
              (i) The term specialty steel means those steel products containing alloying elements which are added to enhance the properties of the steel product when individual alloying elements (e.g., aluminum, chromium, cobalt, columbium, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium) exceed 3% or the total of all alloying elements exceed 5%.
              (j) The term carbon steel means those steel products other than specialty steel products.
              (k) The term carbon hot forming operation (or “carbon”) means those hot forming operations which produce a majority, on a tonnage basis, of carbon steel products.
              (l) The term specialty hot forming operation (or “specialty”) applies to all hot forming operations other than “carbon hot forming operations.”
            
            
              § 420.72

              Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).
              The Agency has determined that there are not significant quantities of toxic pollutants in hot forming wastewaters after compliance with applicable BPT limitations. Accordingly, since the BPT level of treatment provides adequate control, the Agency is not promulgating more stringent BAT limitations.

              Applicability; description of the cold forming subcategory.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges and to the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works from cold rolling and cold working pipe and tube operations in which unheated steel is passed through rolls or otherwise processed to reduce its thickness, to produce a smooth surface, or to develop controlled mechanical properties in the steel.
              (b) The limitations and standards set out below for cold worked pipe and tube operations shall be applicable only where cold worked pipe and tube wastewaters are discharged at steel plant sites. No limitations are applicable or allowable where these wastewaters are hauled off-site for disposal or are otherwise not discharged at steel plant sites. The limitations and standards set out below for cold worked pipe and tube operations shall be applicable only to the blowdown of soluble oil or water solutions used in cold worked pipe and tube forming operations. Limitations for other wastewater sources from these operations must be established on a site-specific basis.

              Applicability; description of the hot coating subcategory.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges and to the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works resulting from the operations in which steel is coated with zinc, terne metal, or other metals by the hot dip process, and those rinsing operations associated with that process.

              (b) The BPT and BAT limitations for zinc set out below are not applicable to hot coating operations with wastewater treatment facilities achieving, during periods of normal production, zinc discharge levels more stringent than those BPT and BAT limitations. For such operations, the BPT and BAT limitations for zinc shall be determined on a case-by-case basis based upon the existing performance of the wastewater treatment facility. The permitting authority shall evaluate representative effluent data from the wastewater treatment facility during periods of normal production in establishing the case-by-case BPT and BAT limitations. The BPT and BAT limitations specified in 40 CFR 420.122 and 420.123 may be used as the basis for calculating total mass limitations for zinc pursuant to 40 CFR 420.03.

              Specialized definitions.
              (a) The term galvanizing means coating steel products with zinc by the hot dip process including the immersion of the steel product in a molten bath of zinc metal, and the related operations preceding and subsequent to the immersion phase.
              (b) The term terne coating means coating steel products with terne metal by the hot dip process including the immersion of the steel product in a molten bath of lead and tin metals, and the related operations preceding and subsequent to the immersion phase.
              (c) The term other coatings means coating steel products with metals other than zinc or terne metal by the hot dip process including the immersion of the steel product in a molten bath of metal, and the related operations preceding the subsequent to the immersion phase.
              (d) The term fume scrubber means wet air pollution control devices used to remove and clean fumes originating from hot coating operations.
              (e) The term strip, sheet, and miscellaneous products means steel products other than wire products and fasteners.
              (f) The term wire products and fasteners means steel wire, products manufactured from steel wire, and steel fasteners manufactured from steel wire or other steel shapes.

              § 420.130
              Applicability.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges to waters of the U.S. and the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works resulting from production of direct-reduced iron and from briquetting and forging operations.
            
            
              § 420.131
              Specialized definitions.
              As used in this subpart:
              (a) The term briquetting operations means a hot or cold process that agglomerates (presses together) iron-bearing materials into small lumps without melting or fusion. Used as a concentrated iron ore substitute for scrap in electric furnaces.
              (b) The term direct-reduced iron (DRI) means iron produced by reduction of iron ore (pellets or briquettes) using gaseous (carbon monoxide-carbon dioxide, hydrogen) or solid reactants.
              (c) The term forging means the hot-working of heated steel shapes (e.g., ingots, blooms, billets, slabs) by hammering or hydraulic presses, performed at iron and steel mills.
              (d) For briquetting operations, the term product means the amount in tons of briquettes manufactured by hot or cold agglomeration processes.
              (e) For direct reduced iron (DRI), the term product means the amount of direct reduced iron and any fines that are produced and sold commercially (as opposed to fines that may be reprocessed on site).
              (f) For forging, the term product means the tons of finished steel forgings produced by hot working steel shapes.
              (g) The term O&G (as HEM) means total recoverable oil & grease measured as n-hexane extractable materials.

              § 421.40
              Applicability: Description of the primary copper smelting subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to process wastewater discharges resulting from the primary smelting of copper from ore or ore concentrates. Primary copper smelting includes, but is not limited to, roasting, converting, leaching if preceded by a pyrometallurgical step, slag granulation and dumping, fire refining, and the casting of products from these operations.
            
            
              § 421.41
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations, and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 apply to this subpart.
              (b) In the event that the waste streams covered by this subpart are combined for treatment or discharge with waste streams covered by Subparts E—Primary Electrolytic Copper Refining and/or Subpart I—Metallurgical Acid Plants, the quantity of each pollutant or pollutant property discharged shall not exceed the quantity of each pollutant or pollutant property which could be discharged if each waste stream were discharged separately.
              (c) For all impoundments constructed prior to the effective date of the interim final regulation (40 FR 8513), the term “within the impoundment,” when used to calculate the volume of process wastewater which may be discharged, means the water surface area within the impoundment at maximum capacity plus the surface area of the inside and outside slopes of the impoundment dam as well as the surface area between the outside edge of the impoundment dam and any seepage ditch adjacent to the dam upon which rain falls and is returned to the impoundment. For the purpose of such calculations, the surface area allowances set forth above shall not exceed more than 30 percent of the water surface area within the impoundment dam at maximum capacity.
              (d) For all impoundments constructed on or after the effective date of the interim final regulation (the interim regulation was effective February 27, 1975; 40 FR 8513, February 27, 1975), the term “within the impoundment,” for purposes of calculating the volume of process wastewater which may be discharged, means the water surface area within the impoundment at maximum capacity.

              (a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32 and paragraph (b) of this section, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT): There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants to navigable waters.
              (b) A process wastewater impoundment which is designed, constructed, and operated so as to contain the precipitation from the 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event as established by the National Climatic Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for the area in which such impoundment is located may discharge that volume of process wastewater which is equivalent to the volume of precipitation that falls within the impoundment in excess of that attributable to the 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event, when such event occurs.
            
            
              § 421.43
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable.
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable:
              (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, there shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants into navigable waters.
              (b) A process wastewater impoundment which is designed, constructed, and operated so as to contain the precipitation from the 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event as established by the National Climatic Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for the area in which such impoundment is located may discharge that volume of process wastewater which is equivalent to the volume of precipitation that falls within the impoundment in excess of that attributable to the 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event, when such event occurs.

              Applicability: Description of the secondary copper subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the recovery, processing, and remelting of new and used copper scrap and residues to produce copper metal and copper alloys, but are not applicable to continuous rod casting.
            
            
              § 421.61
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations, and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.

              (b) For all impoundments constructed prior to the effective date of this regulation the term “within the impoundment” when used for purposes of calculating the volume of process wastewater which may be discharged shall mean the water surface area within the impoundment at maximum capacity plus the surface area of the inside and outside slopes of the impoundment dam as well as the surface area between the outside edge of the impoundment dam and any seepage ditch immediately adjacent to the dam upon which rain falls and is returned to the impoundment. For the purpose of such calculations, the surface area allowances set forth above shall not be more than 30 percent of the water surface area within the impoundment dam at maximum capacity.
              (c) For all impoundments constructed on or after the effective date of this regulation, the term “within the impoundment” for purposes of calculating the volume of process wastewater which may be discharged shall mean the water surface area within the impoundment at maximum capacity.
              (d) The term pond water surface area when used for the purpose of calculating the volume of wastewater which may be discharged shall mean the water surface area of the pond created by the impoundment for storage of process wastewater at normal operating level. This surface shall in no case be less than one-third of the surface area of the maximum amount of water which could be contained by the impoundment. The normal operating level shall be the average level of the pond during the preceding calendar month.
            
            
              § 421.62
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              (a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable technology currently available: Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, there shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants into navigable waters.
              (b) A process wastewater impoundment which is designed, constructed, and operated so as to contain the precipitation from the 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event as established by the National Climatic Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the areas in which such impoundment is located may discharge that volume of process wastewater which is equivalent to the volume of precipitation that falls within the impoundment in excess of that attributable to the 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event, when such event occurs.
              (c) During any calendar month there may be discharged from a process wastewater impoundment either a volume of process wastewater equal to the difference between the precipitation for the month that falls within the impoundment and either the evaporation from the pond water surface area for that month, or a volume of process wastewater equal to the difference between the mean precipitation for that month that falls within the impoundment and the mean evaporation from the pond water surface area as establsihed by the National Climatic Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for the area in which such impoundment is located (or as otherwise determined if no monthly data have been established by the National Climatic Center), whichever is greater.
              (d) Any process wastewater discharged pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall comply with each of the following requirements:

              (b) The term process waste water means any water which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product, or waste product. The term “process waste water” does not include contaminated non-process waste water, as defined below.
              (c) The term contaminated nonprocess waste water shall mean any water including precipitation runoff, which during manufacturing or processing, comes into incidental contact with any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product or waste product by means of:
              (1) Precipitation runoff, (2) accidental spills, (3) accidental leaks caused by the failure of process equipment and which are repaired or the discharge of pollutants therefrom contained or terminated within the shortest reasonable time which shall not exceed 24 hours after discovery or when discovery should reasonably have been made, whichever is earliest, and (4) discharges from safety showers and related personal safety equipment, and from equipment washings for the purpose of safe entry, inspection and maintenance; provided that all reasonable measures have been taken to prevent, reduce, eliminate and control to the maximum extent feasible such contact and provided further that all reasonable measures have been taken that will mitigate the effects of such contact once it has occurred.
              (d) The term ten-year 24-hour rainfall event shall mean the maximum precipitation event with a probable recurrence interval of once in 10 years as defined by the National Weather Service in technical paper no. 40, “Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States,” May 1961, and subsequent amendments or equivalent regional or State rainfall probability information developed therefrom.
              (e) The term 25-year 24-hour rainfall event shall mean the maximum precipitation event with a probable recurrence interval of once in 25 years as defined by the National Weather Service in technical paper no. 40, “Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States,” May 1961, and subsequent amendments or equivalent regional or State rainfall probability information developed therefrom.

            Applicability.
            The provisions of this part apply to discharges resulting from the operation of a generating unit by an establishment whose generation of electricity is the predominant source of revenue or principal reason for operation, and whose generation of electricity results primarily from a process utilizing fossil-type fuel (coal, oil, or gas), fuel derived from fossil fuel (e.g., petroleum coke, synthesis gas), or nuclear fuel in conjunction with a thermal cycle employing the steam water system as the thermodynamic medium. This part applies to discharges associated with both the combustion turbine and steam turbine portions of a combined cycle generating unit.

            § 423.11
            Specialized definitions.
            In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:
            (a) The term total residual chlorine (or total residual oxidants for intake water with bromides) means the value obtained using any of the “chlorine—total residual” methods in Table IB in 40 CFR 136.3(a), or other methods approved by the permitting authority.
            
            (b) The term low volume waste sources means, taken collectively as if from one source, wastewater from all sources except those for which specific limitations or standards are otherwise established in this part. Low volume waste sources include, but are not limited to, the following: Wastewaters from ion exchange water treatment systems, water treatment evaporator blowdown, laboratory and sampling streams, boiler blowdown, floor drains, cooling tower basin cleaning wastes, recirculating house service water systems, and wet scrubber air pollution control systems whose primary purpose is particulate removal. Sanitary wastes, air conditioning wastes, and wastewater from carbon capture or sequestration systems are not included in this definition.
            (c) The term chemical metal cleaning waste means any wastewater resulting from the cleaning of any metal process equipment with chemical compounds, including, but not limited to, boiler tube cleaning.
            (d) The term metal cleaning waste means any wastewater resulting from cleaning [with or without chemical cleaning compounds] any metal process equipment including, but not limited to, boiler tube cleaning, boiler fireside cleaning, and air preheater cleaning.
            (e) The term fly ash means the ash that is carried out of the furnace by a gas stream and collected by a capture device such as a mechanical precipitator, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filter. Economizer ash is included in this definition when it is collected with fly ash. Ash is not included in this definition when it is collected in wet scrubber air pollution control systems whose primary purpose is particulate removal.
            (f) The term bottom ash means the ash, including boiler slag, which settles in the furnace or is dislodged from furnace walls. Economizer ash is included in this definition when it is collected with bottom ash.
            (g) The term once through cooling water means water passed through the main cooling condensers in one or two passes for the purpose of removing waste heat.
            (h) The term recirculated cooling water means water which is passed through the main condensers for the purpose of removing waste heat, passed through a cooling device for the purpose of removing such heat from the water and then passed again, except for blowdown, through the main condenser.
            (i) The term 10 year, 24/hour rainfall event means a rainfall event with a probable recurrence interval of once in ten years as defined by the National Weather Service in Technical Paper No. 40. Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States, May 1961 or equivalent regional rainfall probability information developed therefrom.
            (j) The term blowdown means the minimum discharge of recirculating water for the purpose of discharging materials contained in the water, the further buildup of which would cause concentration in amounts exceeding limits established by best engineering practices.
            (k) The term average concentration as it relates to chlorine discharge means the average of analyses made over a single period of chlorine release which does not exceed two hours.
            (l) The term free available chlorine means the value obtained using any of the “chlorine—free available” methods in Table IB in 40 CFR 136.3(a) where the method has the capability of measuring free available chlorine, or other methods approved by the permitting authority.
            (m) The term coal pile runoff means the rainfall runoff from or through any coal storage pile.

            (n) The term flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater means any wastewater generated specifically from the wet flue gas desulfurization scrubber system that comes into contact with the flue gas or the FGD solids, including but not limited to, the blowdown from the FGD scrubber system, overflow or underflow from the solids separation process, FGD solids wash water, and the filtrate from the solids dewatering process. Wastewater generated from cleaning the FGD scrubber, cleaning FGD solids separation equipment, cleaning FGD solids dewatering equipment, or that is collected in floor drains in the FGD process area is not considered FGD wastewater.
            
            (o) The term flue gas mercury control wastewater means any wastewater generated from an air pollution control system installed or operated for the purpose of removing mercury from flue gas. This includes fly ash collection systems when the particulate control system follows sorbent injection or other controls to remove mercury from flue gas. FGD wastewater generated at plants using oxidizing agents to remove mercury in the FGD system and not in a separate FGMC system is not included in this definition.
            (p) The term transport water means any wastewater that is used to convey fly ash, bottom ash, or economizer ash from the ash collection or storage equipment, or boiler, and has direct contact with the ash. Transport water does not include low volume, short duration discharges of wastewater from minor leaks (e.g., leaks from valve packing, pipe flanges, or piping) or minor maintenance events (e.g., replacement of valves or pipe sections).

            (q) The term gasification wastewater means any wastewater generated at an integrated gasification combined cycle operation from the gasifier or the syngas cleaning, combustion, and cooling processes. Gasification wastewater includes, but is not limited to the following: Sour/grey water; CO2/steam stripper wastewater; sulfur recovery unit blowdown, and wastewater resulting from slag handling or fly ash handling, particulate removal, halogen removal, or trace organic removal. Air separation unit blowdown, noncontact cooling water, and runoff from fuel and/or byproduct piles are not considered gasification wastewater. Wastewater that is collected intermittently in floor drains in the gasification process area from leaks, spills, and cleaning occurring during normal operation of the gasification operation is not considered gasification wastewater.
            (r) The term combustion residual leachate means leachate from landfills or surface impoundments containing combustion residuals. Leachate is composed of liquid, including any suspended or dissolved constituents in the liquid, that has percolated through waste or other materials emplaced in a landfill, or that passes through the surface impoundment's containment structure (e.g., bottom, dikes, berms). Combustion residual leachate includes seepage and/or leakage from a combustion residual landfill or impoundment unit. Combustion residual leachate includes wastewater from landfills and surface impoundments located on non-adjoining property when under the operational control of the permitted facility.
            (s) The term oil-fired unit means a generating unit that uses oil as the primary or secondary fuel source and does not use a gasification process or any coal or petroleum coke as a fuel source. This definition does not include units that use oil only for start up or flame-stabilization purposes.
            (t) The phrase “as soon as possible” means November 1, 2018 (except for purposes of § 423.13(g)(1)(i) and (k)(1)(i), and § 423.16(e) and (g), in which case it means November 1, 2020), unless the permitting authority establishes a later date, after receiving information from the discharger, which reflects a consideration of the following factors:
            (1) Time to expeditiously plan (including to raise capital), design, procure, and install equipment to comply with the requirements of this part.
            (2) Changes being made or planned at the plant in response to:
            (i) New source performance standards for greenhouse gases from new fossil fuel-fired electric generating units, under sections 111, 301, 302, and 307(d)(1)(C) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7411, 7601, 7602, 7607(d)(1)(C);

            § 423.12
            Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).
            (a) In establishing the limitations set forth in this section, EPA took into account all information it was able to collect, develop and solicit with respect to factors (such as age and size of plant, utilization of facilities, raw materials, manufacturing processes, non-water quality environmental impacts, control and treatment technology available, energy requirements and costs) which can affect the industry subcategorization and effluent levels established. It is, however, possible that data which would affect these limitations have not been available and, as a result, these limitations should be adjusted for certain plants in this industry. An individual discharger or other interested person may submit evidence to the Regional Administrator (or to the State, if the State has the authority to issue NPDES permits) that factors relating to the equipment or facilities involved, the process applied, or other such factors related to such discharger are fundamentally different from the factors considered in the establishment of the guidelines. On the basis of such evidence or other available information, the Regional Administrator (or the State) will make a written finding that such factors are or are not fundamentally different for that facility compared to those specified in the Development Document. If such fundamentally different factors are found to exist, the Regional Administrator or the State shall establish for the discharger effluent limitations in the NPDES Permit either more or less stringent than the limitations established herein, to the extent dictated by such fundamentally different factors. Such limitations must be approved by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Administrator may approve or disapprove such limitations, specify other limitations, or initiate proceedings to revise these regulations. The phrase “other such factors” appearing above may include significant cost differentials. In no event may a discharger's impact on receiving water quality be considered as a factor under this paragraph.
            (b) Any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):
            (1) The pH of all discharges, except once through cooling water, shall be within the range of 6.0-9.0.
            (2) There shall be no discharge of polychlorinated biphenyl compounds such as those commonly used for transformer fluid.

              Applicability; description of the open electric furnaces with wet air pollution control devices subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the smelting of ferroalloys in open electric furnaces with wet air pollution control devices. This subcategory includes those electric furnaces of such construction or configuration that the furnace off-gases are burned above the furnace charge level by air drawn into the system. After combustion the gases are cleaned in a wet air pollution control device, such as a scrubber, an electrostatic precipitator with water or other aqueous sprays, etc. The provisions of this subpart are not applicable to noncontact cooling water or to those electric furnaces which are covered, closed, sealed, or semi-covered and in which the furnace off-gases are not burned prior to collection (regulated in subpart B of this part).

              Applicability; description of the covered electric furnaces and other smelting operations with wet air pollution control devices subcategory.

              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the smelting of ferroalloys in covered electric furnaces or other smelting operations, not elsewhere included in this part, with wet air pollution control devices. This subcategory includes those electric furnaces of such construction or configuration (known as covered, closed, sealed, semi-covered or semi-closed furnaces) that the furnace off-gases are not burned prior to collection and cleaning, and which off-gases are cleaned after collection in a wet air pollution control device such as a scrubber, ‘wet’ baghouse, etc. This subcategory also includes those non- electric furnace smelting operations, such as exothermic (i.e., aluminothermic or silicothermic) smelting, ferromanganese refining, etc., where these are controlled for air pollution by wet air pollution control devices. This subcategory does not include noncontact cooling water or those furnaces which utilize dry dust collection techniques, such as dry baghouses.
