      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 60.2
              Definitions.
              The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this section as follows:
              
                Act means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)
              
                Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or his authorized representative.
              
                Affected facility means, with reference to a stationary source, any apparatus to which a standard is applicable.
              
                Alternative method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant which is not a reference or equivalent method but which has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to, in specific cases, produce results adequate for his determination of compliance.
              
                Approved permit program means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to Title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
              
                Capital expenditure means an expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing facility which exceeds the product of the applicable “annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage” specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 534 and the existing facility's basis, as defined by section 1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing facility must not be reduced by any “excluded additions” as defined in IRS Publication 534, as would be done for tax purposes.
              
                Clean coal technology demonstration project means a project using funds appropriated under the heading ‘Department of Energy-Clean Coal Technology’, up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial demonstrations of clean coal technology, or similar projects funded through appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency.
              
                Commenced means, with respect to the definition of new source in section 111(a)(2) of the Act, that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or modification or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or modification.
              
                Construction means fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected facility.
              
                Continuous monitoring system means the total equipment, required under the emission monitoring sections in applicable subparts, used to sample and condition (if applicable), to analyze, and to provide a permanent record of emissions or process parameters.
              
                Electric utility steam generating unit means any steam electric generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for sale. Any steam supplied to a steam distribution system for the purpose of providing steam to a steam-electric generator that would produce electrical energy for sale is also considered in determining the electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility.

              (4) A notification of any physical or operational change to an existing facility which may increase the emission rate of any air pollutant to which a standard applies, unless that change is specifically exempted under an applicable subpart or in § 60.14(e). This notice shall be postmarked 60 days or as soon as practicable before the change is commenced and shall include information describing the precise nature of the change, present and proposed emission control systems, productive capacity of the facility before and after the change, and the expected completion date of the change. The Administrator may request additional relevant information subsequent to this notice.
              (5) A notification of the date upon which demonstration of the continuous monitoring system performance commences in accordance with § 60.13(c). Notification shall be postmarked not less than 30 days prior to such date.
              (6) A notification of the anticipated date for conducting the opacity observations required by § 60.11(e)(1) of this part. The notification shall also include, if appropriate, a request for the Administrator to provide a visible emissions reader during a performance test. The notification shall be postmarked not less than 30 days prior to such date.
              (7) A notification that continuous opacity monitoring system data results will be used to determine compliance with the applicable opacity standard during a performance test required by § 60.8 in lieu of Method 9 observation data as allowed by § 60.11(e)(5) of this part. This notification shall be postmarked not less than 30 days prior to the date of the performance test.
              (b) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain records of the occurrence and duration of any startup, shutdown, or malfunction in the operation of an affected facility; any malfunction of the air pollution control equipment; or any periods during which a continuous monitoring system or monitoring device is inoperative.
              (c) Each owner or operator required to install a continuous monitoring device shall submit excess emissions and monitoring systems performance report (excess emissions are defined in applicable subparts) and-or summary report form (see paragraph (d) of this section) to the Administrator semiannually, except when: more frequent reporting is specifically required by an applicable subpart; or the Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, determines that more frequent reporting is necessary to accurately assess the compliance status of the source. All reports shall be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each six-month period. Written reports of excess emissions shall include the following information:
              (1) The magnitude of excess emissions computed in accordance with § 60.13(h), any conversion factor(s) used, and the date and time of commencement and completion of each time period of excess emissions. The process operating time during the reporting period.
              (2) Specific identification of each period of excess emissions that occurs during startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the affected facility. The nature and cause of any malfunction (if known), the corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted.
              (3) The date and time identifying each period during which the continuous monitoring system was inoperative except for zero and span checks and the nature of the system repairs or adjustments.
              (4) When no excess emissions have occurred or the continuous monitoring system(s) have not been inoperative, repaired, or adjusted, such information shall be stated in the report.
              (d) The summary report form shall contain the information and be in the format shown in figure 1 unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. One summary report form shall be submitted for each pollutant monitored at each affected facility.
              (1) If the total duration of excess emissions for the reporting period is less than 1 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period and CMS downtime for the reporting period is less than 5 percent of the total operating time for the reporting period, only the summary report form shall be submitted and the excess emission report described in § 60.7(c) need not be submitted unless requested by the Administrator.

              (2) If the total duration of excess emissions for the reporting period is 1 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period or the total CMS downtime for the reporting period is 5 percent or greater of the total operating time for the reporting period, the summary report form and the excess emission report described in § 60.7(c) shall both be submitted.

              (e)(1) Notwithstanding the frequency of reporting requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator who is required by an applicable subpart to submit excess emissions and monitoring systems performance reports (and summary reports) on a quarterly (or more frequent) basis may reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard to semiannual if the following conditions are met:
              (i) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting periods) the affected facility's excess emissions and monitoring systems reports submitted to comply with a standard under this part continually demonstrate that the facility is in compliance with the applicable standard;
              (ii) The owner or operator continues to comply with all recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and the applicable standard; and
              (iii) The Administrator does not object to a reduced frequency of reporting for the affected facility, as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

              (2) The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and monitoring systems performance (and summary) reports may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the required recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, including performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.
              (3) As soon as monitoring data indicate that the affected facility is not in compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter specified in the applicable standard, the frequency of reporting shall revert to the frequency specified in the applicable standard, and the owner or operator shall submit an excess emissions and monitoring systems performance report (and summary report, if required) at the next appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event. After demonstrating compliance with the applicable standard for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard as provided for in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
              (f) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain a file of all measurements, including continuous monitoring system, monitoring device, and performance testing measurements; all continuous monitoring system performance evaluations; all continuous monitoring system or monitoring device calibration checks; adjustments and maintenance performed on these systems or devices; and all other information required by this part recorded in a permanent form suitable for inspection. The file shall be retained for at least two years following the date of such measurements, maintenance, reports, and records, except as follows:
              (1) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) where the CEMS installed is automated, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CEMS records and reduces the measured data to the form of the pollutant emission standard through the use of a computerized data acquisition system. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain the most recent consecutive three averaging periods of subhourly measurements and a file that contains a hard copy of the data acquisition system algorithm used to reduce the measured data into the reportable form of the standard.
              (2) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a CEMS where the measured data is manually reduced to obtain the reportable form of the standard, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain all subhourly measurements for the most recent reporting period. The subhourly measurements shall be retained for 120 days from the date of the most recent summary or excess emission report submitted to the Administrator.
              (3) The Administrator or delegated authority, upon notification to the source, may require the owner or operator to maintain all measurements as required by paragraph (f) of this section, if the Administrator or the delegated authority determines these records are required to more accurately assess the compliance status of the affected source.
              (g) If notification substantially similar to that in paragraph (a) of this section is required by any other State or local agency, sending the Administrator a copy of that notification will satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

              (h) Individual subparts of this part may include specific provisions which clarify or make inapplicable the provisions set forth in this section.

              § 60.8
              Performance tests.
              (a) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1),(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section, within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial startup of such facility, or at such other times specified by this part, and at such other times as may be required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Act, the owner or operator of such facility shall conduct performance test(s) and furnish the Administrator a written report of the results of such performance test(s).
              (1) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.
              (2) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.
              (3) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.
              (4) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
              (b) Performance tests shall be conducted and data reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in each applicable subpart unless the Administrator (1) specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a reference method with minor changes in methodology, (2) approves the use of an equivalent method, (3) approves the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in compliance, (4) waives the requirement for performance tests because the owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected facility is in compliance with the standard, or (5) approves shorter sampling times and smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Act.

              (c) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to the plant operator based on representative performance of the affected facility. The owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test nor shall emissions in excess of the level of the applicable emission limit during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction be considered a violation of the applicable emission limit unless otherwise specified in the applicable standard.
              
              (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) by mutual agreement.
              (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:
              (1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such facility. This includes (i) constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures and (ii) providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.
              (2) Safe sampling platform(s).
              (3) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
              (4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
              (f) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, each performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method.
              (1) Each run shall be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. For the purpose of determining compliance with an applicable standard, the arithmetic means of results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.
              (2) Contents of report (electronic or paper submitted copy). Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard or test method, or as otherwise approved by the Administrator in writing, the report for a performance test shall include the elements identified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
              (i) General identification information for the facility including a mailing address, the physical address, the owner or operator or responsible official (where applicable) and his/her email address, and the appropriate Federal Registry System (FRS) number for the facility.
              (ii) Purpose of the test including the applicable regulation(s) requiring the test, the pollutant(s) and other parameters being measured, the applicable emission standard and any process parameter component, and a brief process description.
              (iii) Description of the emission unit tested including fuel burned, control devices, and vent characteristics; the appropriate source classification code (SCC); the permitted maximum process rate (where applicable); and the sampling location.
              (iv) Description of sampling and analysis procedures used and any modifications to standard procedures, quality assurance procedures and results, record of process operating conditions that demonstrate the applicable test conditions are met, and values for any operating parameters for which limits were being set during the test.
              (v) Where a test method requires you record or report, the following shall be included: Record of preparation of standards, record of calibrations, raw data sheets for field sampling, raw data sheets for field and laboratory analyses, chain-of-custody documentation, and example calculations for reported results.

              (vi) Identification of the company conducting the performance test including the primary office address, telephone number, and the contact for this test program including his/her email address.
              (g) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.

              (1) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60, Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix A-4 of part 60, Methods 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60, Methods 20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60, Methods 30A and 30B of appendix A-8 of part 60, and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request and the compliance authority may grant a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.
              (2) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
              (i) Preparing the sample;
              (ii) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;
              (iii) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range.
              (iv) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;
              (v) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;
              (vi) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;
              (vii) The AASP shall report the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and then to the source owner, operator, or representative. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.

              (viii) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in cooperation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed;
              (ix) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.
              (3) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
              (i) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP;
              (ii) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years;
              (iii) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.

              (4) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm. The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (g)(2) through (4)of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.
              
              (h) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, each test location must be verified to be free of cyclonic flow and evaluated for the existence of emission gas stratification and the required number of sampling traverse points. If other procedures are not specified in the applicable subpart to the regulations, use the appropriate procedures in Method 1 to check for cyclonic flow and Method 7E to evaluate emission gas stratification and selection of sampling points.
              (i) Whenever the use of multiple calibration gases is required by a test method, performance specification, or quality assurance procedure in a part 60 standard or appendix, Method 205 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M of this chapter, “Verification of Gas Dilution Systems for Field Instrument Calibrations,” may be used.

              Availability of information.
              The availability to the public of information provided to, or otherwise obtained by, the Administrator under this part shall be governed by part 2 of this chapter. (Information submitted voluntarily to the Administrator for the purposes of §§ 60.5 and 60.6 is governed by §§ 2.201 through 2.213 of this chapter and not by § 2.301 of this chapter.)
            
            
              § 60.10
              State authority.

              The provisions of this part shall not be construed in any manner to preclude any State or political subdivision thereof from:
              
              (a) Adopting and enforcing any emission standard or limitation applicable to an affected facility, provided that such emission standard or limitation is not less stringent than the standard applicable to such facility.
              (b) Requiring the owner or operator of an affected facility to obtain permits, licenses, or approvals prior to initiating construction, modification, or operation of such facility.
            
            
              § 60.11
              Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.
              (a) Compliance with standards in this part, other than opacity standards, shall be determined in accordance with performance tests established by § 60.8, unless otherwise specified in the applicable standard.
              (b) Compliance with opacity standards in this part shall be determined by conducting observations in accordance with Method 9 in appendix A of this part, any alternative method that is approved by the Administrator, or as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. For purposes of determining initial compliance, the minimum total time of observations shall be 3 hours (30 6-minute averages) for the performance test or other set of observations (meaning those fugitive-type emission sources subject only to an opacity standard).
              (c) The opacity standards set forth in this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and as otherwise provided in the applicable standard.
              (d) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, owners and operators shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate any affected facility including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, opacity observations, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the source.

              (e)(1) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, opacity observations shall be conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required in § 60.8 unless one of the following conditions apply. If no performance test under § 60.8 is required, then opacity observations shall be conducted within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated but no later than 180 days after initial startup of the facility. If visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required under § 60.8, the source owner or operator shall reschedule the opacity observations as soon after the initial performance test as possible, but not later than 30 days thereafter, and shall advise the Administrator of the rescheduled date. In these cases, the 30-day prior notification to the Administrator required in § 60.7(a)(6) shall be waived. The rescheduled opacity observations shall be conducted (to the extent possible) under the same operating conditions that existed during the initial performance test conducted under § 60.8. The visible emissions observer shall determine whether visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity observations from being made concurrently with the initial performance test in accordance with procedures contained in Method 9 of appendix B of this part. Opacity readings of portions of plumes which contain condensed, uncombined water vapor shall not be used for purposes of determing compliance with opacity standards. The owner or operator of an affected facility shall make available, upon request by the Administrator, such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions under which the visual observations were made and shall provide evidence indicating proof of current visible observer emission certification. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the results of continuous monitoring by transmissometer which indicate that the opacity at the time visual observations were made was not in excess of the standard are probative but not conclusive evidence of the actual opacity of an emission, provided that the source shall meet the burden of proving that the instrument used meets (at the time of the alleged violation) Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of this part, has been properly maintained and (at the time of the alleged violation) that the resulting data have not been altered in any way.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility to which an opacity standard in this part applies shall conduct opacity observations in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall record the opacity of emissions, and shall report to the Administrator the opacity results along with the results of the initial performance test required under § 60.8. The inability of an owner or operator to secure a visible emissions observer shall not be considered a reason for not conducting the opacity observations concurrent with the initial performance test.
              (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility to which an opacity standard in this part applies may request the Administrator to determine and to record the opacity of emissions from the affected facility during the initial performance test and at such times as may be required. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall report the opacity results. Any request to the Administrator to determine and to record the opacity of emissions from an affected facility shall be included in the notification required in § 60.7(a)(6). If, for some reason, the Administrator cannot determine and record the opacity of emissions from the affected facility during the performance test, then the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply.
              (4) An owner or operator of an affected facility using a continuous opacity monitor (transmissometer) shall record the monitoring data produced during the initial performance test required by § 60.8 and shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the monitoring results along with Method 9 and § 60.8 performance test results.
              (5) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard may submit, for compliance purposes, continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) data results produced during any performance test required under § 60.8 in lieu of Method 9 observation data. If an owner or operator elects to submit COMS data for compliance with the opacity standard, he shall notify the Administrator of that decision, in writing, at least 30 days before any performance test required under § 60.8 is conducted. Once the owner or operator of an affected facility has notified the Administrator to that effect, the COMS data results will be used to determine opacity compliance during subsequent tests required under § 60.8 until the owner or operator notifies the Administrator, in writing, to the contrary. For the purpose of determining compliance with the opacity standard during a performance test required under § 60.8 using COMS data, the minimum total time of COMS data collection shall be averages of all 6-minute continuous periods within the duration of the mass emission performance test. Results of the COMS opacity determinations shall be submitted along with the results of the performance test required under § 60.8. The owner or operator of an affected facility using a COMS for compliance purposes is responsible for demonstrating that the COMS meets the requirements specified in § 60.13(c) of this part, that the COMS has been properly maintained and operated, and that the resulting data have not been altered in any way. If COMS data results are submitted for compliance with the opacity standard for a period of time during which Method 9 data indicates noncompliance, the Method 9 data will be used to determine compliance with the opacity standard.

              (6) Upon receipt from an owner or operator of the written reports of the results of the performance tests required by § 60.8, the opacity observation results and observer certification required by § 60.11(e)(1), and the COMS results, if applicable, the Administrator will make a finding concerning compliance with opacity and other applicable standards. If COMS data results are used to comply with an opacity standard, only those results are required to be submitted along with the performance test results required by § 60.8. If the Administrator finds that an affected facility is in compliance with all applicable standards for which performance tests are conducted in accordance with § 60.8 of this part but during the time such performance tests are being conducted fails to meet any applicable opacity standard, he shall notify the owner or operator and advise him that he may petition the Administrator within 10 days of receipt of notification to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity standard for the affected facility.
              (7) The Administrator will grant such a petition upon a demonstration by the owner or operator that the affected facility and associated air pollution control equipment was operated and maintained in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance tests; that the performance tests were performed under the conditions established by the Administrator; and that the affected facility and associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being adjusted or operated to meet the applicable opacity standard.

              (8) The Administrator will establish an opacity standard for the affected facility meeting the above requirements at a level at which the source will be able, as indicated by the performance and opacity tests, to meet the opacity standard at all times during which the source is meeting the mass or concentration emission standard. The Administrator will promulgate the new opacity standard in the Federal Register.
              
              (f) Special provisions set forth under an applicable subpart shall supersede any conflicting provisions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
              (g) For the purpose of submitting compliance certifications or establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any standard in this part, nothing in this part shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test or procedure had been performed.

              Circumvention.
              No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall build, erect, install, or use any article, machine, equipment or process, the use of which conceals an emission which would otherwise constitute a violation of an applicable standard. Such concealment includes, but is not limited to, the use of gaseous diluents to achieve compliance with an opacity standard or with a standard which is based on the concentration of a pollutant in the gases discharged to the atmosphere.

              § 60.13
              Monitoring requirements.
              (a) For the purposes of this section, all continuous monitoring systems required under applicable subparts shall be subject to the provisions of this section upon promulgation of performance specifications for continuous monitoring systems under appendix B to this part and, if the continuous monitoring system is used to demonstrate compliance with emission limits on a continuous basis, appendix F to this part, unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart or by the Administrator. Appendix F is applicable December 4, 1987.
              (b) All continuous monitoring systems and monitoring devices shall be installed and operational prior to conducting performance tests under § 60.8. Verification of operational status shall, as a minimum, include completion of the manufacturer's written requirements or recommendations for installation, operation, and calibration of the device.

              (c) If the owner or operator of an affected facility elects to submit continous opacity monitoring system (COMS) data for compliance with the opacity standard as provided under § 60.11(e)(5), he shall conduct a performance evaluation of the COMS as specified in Performance Specification 1, appendix B, of this part before the performance test required under § 60.8 is conducted. Otherwise, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct a performance evaluation of the COMS or continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) during any performance test required under § 60.8 or within 30 days thereafter in accordance with the applicable performance specification in appendix B of this part, The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct COMS or CEMS performance evaluations at such other times as may be required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Act.
              (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility using a COMS to determine opacity compliance during any performance test required under § 60.8 and as described in § 60.11(e)(5) shall furnish the Administrator two or, upon request, more copies of a written report of the results of the COMS performance evaluation described in paragraph (c) of this section at least 10 days before the performance test required under § 60.8 is conducted.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall furnish the Administrator within 60 days of completion two or, upon request, more copies of a written report of the results of the performance evaluation.
              (d)(1) Owners and operators of a CEMS installed in accordance with the provisions of this part, must check the zero (or low level value between 0 and 20 percent of span value) and span (50 to 100 percent of span value) calibration drifts at least once each operating day in accordance with a written procedure. The zero and span must, at a minimum, be adjusted whenever either the 24-hour zero drift or the 24-hour span drift exceeds two times the limit of the applicable performance specification in appendix B of this part. The system must allow the amount of the excess zero and span drift to be recorded and quantified whenever specified. Owners and operators of a COMS installed in accordance with the provisions of this part must check the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least once daily. For a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and upscale calibration materials is defined in the applicable version of PS-1 in appendix B of this part. For a COMS, the optical surfaces, exposed to the effluent gases, must be cleaned before performing the zero and upscale drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic zero adjustments. The optical surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation exceeds 4 percent opacity.
              (2) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the following procedures must be followed for a COMS. Minimum procedures must include an automated method for producing a simulated zero opacity condition and an upscale opacity condition using a certified neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known obstruction of the light beam. Such procedures must provide a system check of all active analyzer internal optics with power or curvature, all active electronic circuitry including the light source and photodetector assembly, and electronic or electro-mechanical systems and hardware and or software used during normal measurement operation.
              (e) Except for system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments required under paragraph (d) of this section, all continuous monitoring systems shall be in continuous operation and shall meet minimum frequency of operation requirements as follows:
              (1) All continuous monitoring systems referenced by paragraph (c) of this section for measuring opacity of emissions shall complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.

              (2) All continuous monitoring systems referenced by paragraph (c) of this section for measuring emissions, except opacity, shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period.
              
              (f) All continuous monitoring systems or monitoring devices shall be installed such that representative measurements of emissions or process parameters from the affected facility are obtained. Additional procedures for location of continuous monitoring systems contained in the applicable Performance Specifications of appendix B of this part shall be used.
              (g) When the effluents from a single affected facility or two or more affected facilities subject to the same emission standards are combined before being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator may install applicable continuous monitoring systems on each effluent or on the combined effluent. When the affected facilities are not subject to the same emission standards, separate continuous monitoring systems shall be installed on each effluent. When the effluent from one affected facility is released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the owner or operator shall install an applicable continuous monitoring system on each separate effluent unless the installation of fewer systems is approved by the Administrator. When more than one continuous monitoring system is used to measure the emissions from one affected facility (e.g., multiple breechings, multiple outlets), the owner or operator shall report the results as required from each continuous monitoring system.
              (h)(1) Owners or operators of all continuous monitoring systems for measurement of opacity shall reduce all data to 6-minute averages and for continuous monitoring systems other than opacity to 1-hour averages for time periods as defined in § 60.2. Six-minute opacity averages shall be calculated from 36 or more data points equally spaced over each 6-minute period.
              (2) For continuous monitoring systems other than opacity, 1-hour averages shall be computed as follows, except that the provisions pertaining to the validation of partial operating hours are only applicable for affected facilities that are required by the applicable subpart to include partial hours in the emission calculations:

              (i) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, for a full operating hour (any clock hour with 60 minutes of unit operation), at least four valid data points are required to calculate the hourly average, i.e., one data point in each of the 15-minute quadrants of the hour.
              (ii) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, for a partial operating hour (any clock hour with less than 60 minutes of unit operation), at least one valid data point in each 15-minute quadrant of the hour in which the unit operates is required to calculate the hourly average.
              (iii) For any operating hour in which required maintenance or quality-assurance activities are performed:
              (A) If the unit operates in two or more quadrants of the hour, a minimum of two valid data points, separated by at least 15 minutes, is required to calculate the hourly average; or
              (B) If the unit operates in only one quadrant of the hour, at least one valid data point is required to calculate the hourly average.
              (iv) If a daily calibration error check is failed during any operating hour, all data for that hour shall be invalidated, unless a subsequent calibration error test is passed in the same hour and the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section are met, based solely on valid data recorded after the successful calibration.
              (v) For each full or partial operating hour, all valid data points shall be used to calculate the hourly average.
              (vi) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(vii) of this section, data recorded during periods of continuous monitoring system breakdown, repair, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments shall not be included in the data averages computed under this paragraph.
              (vii) Owners and operators complying with the requirements of § 60.7(f)(1) or (2) must include any data recorded during periods of monitor breakdown or malfunction in the data averages.
              (viii) When specified in an applicable subpart, hourly averages for certain partial operating hours shall not be computed or included in the emission averages (e.g., hours with < 30 minutes of unit operation under § 60.47b(d)).

              (ix) Either arithmetic or integrated averaging of all data may be used to calculate the hourly averages. The data may be recorded in reduced or nonreduced form (e.g., ppm pollutant and percent O2 or ng/J of pollutant).
              (3) All excess emissions shall be converted into units of the standard using the applicable conversion procedures specified in the applicable subpart. After conversion into units of the standard, the data may be rounded to the same number of significant digits used in the applicable subpart to specify the emission limit.
              (i) After receipt and consideration of written application, the Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring procedures or requirements of this part including, but not limited to the following:
              (1) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a continuous monitoring system or monitoring device specified by this part would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other interferences caused by substances in the effluent gases.
              (2) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected facility is infrequently operated.
              (3) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate continuous monitoring systems that require additional measurements to correct for stack moisture conditions.
              (4) Alternative locations for installing continuous monitoring systems or monitoring devices when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and representative measurements.
              (5) Alternative methods of converting pollutant concentration measurements to units of the standards.
              (6) Alternative procedures for performing daily checks of zero and span drift that do not involve use of span gases or test cells.
              (7) Alternatives to the A.S.T.M. test methods or sampling procedures specified by any subpart.
              (8) Alternative continuous monitoring systems that do not meet the design or performance requirements in Performance Specification 1, appendix B, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent relationship between its measurements and the measurements of opacity by a system complying with the requirements in Performance Specification 1. The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for each affected facility.
              (9) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a single affected facility or the combined effluent from two or more affected facilities is released to the atmosphere through more than one point.
              (j) An alternative to the relative accuracy (RA) test specified in Performance Specification 2 of appendix B may be requested as follows:

              (1) An alternative to the reference method tests for determining RA is available for sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less than 50 percent of the applicable standard. A source owner or operator may petition the Administrator to waive the RA test in Section 8.4 of Performance Specification 2 and substitute the procedures in Section 16.0 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the requirements in § 60.8 of this subpart or other tests performed following the criteria in § 60.8 demonstrate that the emission rate of the pollutant of interest in the units of the applicable standard is less than 50 percent of the applicable standard. For sources subject to standards expressed as control efficiency levels, a source owner or operator may petition the Administrator to waive the RA test and substitute the procedures in Section 16.0 of Performance Specification 2 if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The alternative procedures do not apply if the continuous emission monitoring system is used to determine compliance continuously with the applicable standard. The petition to waive the RA test shall include a detailed description of the procedures to be applied. Included shall be location and procedure for conducting the alternative, the concentration or response levels of the alternative RA materials, and the other equipment checks included in the alternative procedure. The Administrator will review the petition for completeness and applicability. The determination to grant a waiver will depend on the intended use of the CEMS data (e.g., data collection purposes other than NSPS) and may require specifications more stringent than in Performance Specification 2 (e.g., the applicable emission limit is more stringent than NSPS).
              (2) The waiver of a CEMS RA test will be reviewed and may be rescinded at such time, following successful completion of the alternative RA procedure, that the CEMS data indicate that the source emissions are approaching the level. The criterion for reviewing the waiver is the collection of CEMS data showing that emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the applicable standard for seven, consecutive, averaging periods as specified by the applicable regulation(s). For sources subject to standards expressed as control efficiency levels, the criterion for reviewing the waiver is the collection of CEMS data showing that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement for seven, consecutive, averaging periods as specified by the applicable regulation(s) [e.g., §§ 60.45(g) (2) and (3), 60.73(e), and 60.84(e)]. It is the responsibility of the source operator to maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the criterion on the waiver of RA testing. If this criterion is exceeded, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator within 10 days of such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the increasing emissions. The Administrator will review the notification and may rescind the waiver and require the owner or operator to conduct a RA test of the CEMS as specified in Section 8.4 of Performance Specification 2.

Upon modification, an existing facility shall become an affected facility for each pollutant to which a standard applies and for which there is an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere.
              (b) Emission rate shall be expressed as kg/hr of any pollutant discharged into the atmosphere for which a standard is applicable. The Administrator shall use the following to determine emission rate:
              (1) Emission factors as specified in the latest issue of “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,” EPA Publication No. AP-42, or other emission factors determined by the Administrator to be superior to AP-42 emission factors, in cases where utilization of emission factors demonstrates that the emission level resulting from the physical or operational change will either clearly increase or clearly not increase.

              (2) Material balances, continuous monitor data, or manual emission tests in cases where utilization of emission factors as referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction whether the emission level resulting from the physical or operational change will either clearly increase or clearly not increase, or where an owner or operator demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds to dispute the result obtained by the Administrator utilizing emission factors as referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When the emission rate is based on results from manual emission tests or continuous monitoring systems, the procedures specified in appendix C of this part shall be used to determine whether an increase in emission rate has occurred. Tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the facility. At least three valid test runs must be conducted before and at least three after the physical or operational change. All operating parameters which may affect emissions must be held constant to the maximum feasible degree for all test runs.
              (c) The addition of an affected facility to a stationary source as an expansion to that source or as a replacement for an existing facility shall not by itself bring within the applicability of this part any other facility within that source.
              (d) [Reserved]
              (e) The following shall not, by themselves, be considered modifications under this part:
              (1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement which the Administrator determines to be routine for a source category, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and § 60.15.
              (2) An increase in production rate of an existing facility, if that increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on that facility.
              (3) An increase in the hours of operation.
              (4) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material if, prior to the date any standard under this part becomes applicable to that source type, as provided by § 60.1, the existing facility was designed to accommodate that alternative use. A facility shall be considered to be designed to accommodate an alternative fuel or raw material if that use could be accomplished under the facility's construction specifications as amended prior to the change. Conversion to coal required for energy considerations, as specified in section 111(a)(8) of the Act, shall not be considered a modification.
              (5) The addition or use of any system or device whose primary function is the reduction of air pollutants, except when an emission control system is removed or is replaced by a system which the Administrator determines to be less environmentally beneficial.
              (6) The relocation or change in ownership of an existing facility.
              (f) Special provisions set forth under an applicable subpart of this part shall supersede any conflicting provisions of this section.
              (g) Within 180 days of the completion of any physical or operational change subject to the control measures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, compliance with all applicable standards must be achieved.
              (h) No physical change, or change in the method of operation, at an existing electric utility steam generating unit shall be treated as a modification for the purposes of this section provided that such change does not increase the maximum hourly emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the maximum hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the 5 years prior to the change.
              (i) Repowering projects that are awarded funding from the Department of Energy as permanent clean coal technology demonstration projects (or similar projects funded by EPA) are exempt from the requirements of this section provided that such change does not increase the maximum hourly emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the maximum hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the five years prior to the change.
              (j)(1) Repowering projects that qualify for an extension under section 409(b) of the Clean Air Act are exempt from the requirements of this section, provided that such change does not increase the actual hourly emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the actual hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the 5 years prior to the change.
              (2) This exemption shall not apply to any new unit that:
              (i) Is designated as a replacement for an existing unit;
              (ii) Qualifies under section 409(b) of the Clean Air Act for an extension of an emission limitation compliance date under section 405 of the Clean Air Act; and
              (iii) Is located at a different site than the existing unit.

              (k) The installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a temporary clean coal technology demonstration project is exempt from the requirements of this section. A temporary clean coal control technology demonstration project, for the purposes of this section is a clean coal technology demonstration project that is operated for a period of 5 years or less, and which complies with the State implementation plan for the State in which the project is located and other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards during the project and after it is terminated.
              (l) The reactivation of a very clean coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit is exempt from the requirements of this section.

              § 60.15
              Reconstruction.
              (a) An existing facility, upon reconstruction, becomes an affected facility, irrespective of any change in emission rate.
              (b) “Reconstruction” means the replacement of components of an existing facility to such an extent that:
              (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new facility, and
              (2) It is technologically and economically feasible to meet the applicable standards set forth in this part.
              (c) “Fixed capital cost” means the capital needed to provide all the depreciable components.
              (d) If an owner or operator of an existing facility proposes to replace components, and the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new facility, he shall notify the Administrator of the proposed replacements. The notice must be postmarked 60 days (or as soon as practicable) before construction of the replacements is commenced and must include the following information:
              (1) Name and address of the owner or operator.
              (2) The location of the existing facility.
              (3) A brief description of the existing facility and the components which are to be replaced.
              (4) A description of the existing air pollution control equipment and the proposed air pollution control equipment.
              (5) An estimate of the fixed capital cost of the replacements and of constructing a comparable entirely new facility.
              (6) The estimated life of the existing facility after the replacements.
              (7) A discussion of any economic or technical limitations the facility may have in complying with the applicable standards of performance after the proposed replacements.
              (e) The Administrator will determine, within 30 days of the receipt of the notice required by paragraph (d) of this section and any additional information he may reasonably require, whether the proposed replacement constitutes reconstruction.
              (f) The Administrator's determination under paragraph (e) shall be based on:
              (1) The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new facility;
              (2) The estimated life of the facility after the replacements compared to the life of a comparable entirely new facility;
              (3) The extent to which the components being replaced cause or contribute to the emissions from the facility; and
              (4) Any economic or technical limitations on compliance with applicable standards of performance which are inherent in the proposed replacements.
              (g) Individual subparts of this part may include specific provisions which refine and delimit the concept of reconstruction set forth in this section.

              (d) Owners or operators of flares used to comply with the provisions of this subpart shall monitor these control devices to ensure that they are operated and maintained in conformance with their designs. Applicable subparts will provide provisions stating how owners or operators of flares shall monitor these control devices.
              (e) Flares used to comply with provisions of this subpart shall be operated at all times when emissions may be vented to them.
              (f)(1) Method 22 of appendix A to this part shall be used to determine the compliance of flares with the visible emission provisions of this subpart. The observation period is 2 hours and shall be used according to Method 22.
              (2) The presence of a flare pilot flame shall be monitored using a thermocouple or any other equivalent device to detect the presence of a flame.
              (3) The net heating value of the gas being combusted in a flare shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.008
              
              
                where:
                
                HT = Net heating value of the sample, MJ/scm; where the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 °C;
                
                  EC01JN92.009
                
                Ci = Concentration of sample component i in ppm on a wet basis, as measured for organics by Reference Method 18 and measured for hydrogen and carbon monoxide by ASTM D1946-77 or 90 (Reapproved 1994) (Incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17); and
                Hi = Net heat of combustion of sample component i, kcal/g mole at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg. The heats of combustion may be determined using ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 60.17) if published values are not available or cannot be calculated.
              
              
              (4) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by dividing the volumetric flowrate (in units of standard temperature and pressure), as determined by Reference Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D as appropriate; by the unobstructed (free) cross sectional area of the flare tip.
              (5) The maximum permitted velocity, Vmax, for flares complying with paragraph (c)(4)(iii) shall be determined by the following equation.
              
                Log10 (Vmax) = (HT + 28.8)/31.7
                
                Vmax = Maximum permitted velocity, M/sec
                28.8 = Constant
                31.7 = Constant
                HT = The net heating value as determined in paragraph (f)(3).
              
              
              (6) The maximum permitted velocity, Vmax, for air-assisted flares shall be determined by the following equation.
              
                Vmax = 8.706 + 0.7084 (HT)
                
                Vmax = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec
                8.706 = Constant
                0.7084 = Constant

              (g) Alternative work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks. Paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section apply to all equipment for which the applicable subpart requires monitoring with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor, except for closed vent systems, equipment designated as leakless, and equipment identified in the applicable subpart as having no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background. An owner or operator may use an optical gas imaging instrument instead of a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor. Requirements in the existing subparts that are specific to the Method 21 instrument do not apply under this section. All other requirements in the applicable subpart that are not addressed in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section apply to this standard. For example, equipment specification requirements, and non-Method 21 instrument recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the applicable subpart continue to apply. The terms defined in paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section have meanings that are specific to the alternative work practice standard in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section.
              (1) Applicable subpart means the subpart in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, or 65 that requires monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
              (2) Equipment means pumps, valves, pressure relief valves, compressors, open-ended lines, flanges, connectors, and other equipment covered by the applicable subpart that require monitoring with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
              (3) Imaging means making visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.
              (4) Optical gas imaging instrument means an instrument that makes visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.
              (5) Repair means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, in order to eliminate a leak.
              (6) Leak means:
              (i) Any emissions imaged by the optical gas instrument;
              (ii) Indications of liquids dripping;
              (iii) Indications by a sensor that a seal or barrier fluid system has failed; or
              (iv) Screening results using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor that exceed the leak definition in the applicable subpart to which the equipment is subject.
              (h) The alternative work practice standard for monitoring equipment for leaks is available to all subparts in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that require monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.
              (1) An owner or operator of an affected source subject to CFR parts 60, 61, 63, or 65 can choose to comply with the alternative work practice requirements in paragraph (i) of this section instead of using the 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor to identify leaking equipment. The owner or operator must document the equipment, process units, and facilities for which the alternative work practice will be used to identify leaks.
              (2) Any leak detected when following the leak survey procedure in paragraph (i)(3) of this section must be identified for repair as required in the applicable subpart.
              (3) If the alternative work practice is used to identify leaks, re-screening after an attempted repair of leaking equipment must be conducted using either the alternative work practice or the 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor at the leak definition required in the applicable subpart to which the equipment is subject.
              (4) The schedule for repair is as required in the applicable subpart.

              (5) When this alternative work practice is used for detecting leaking equipment, choose one of the monitoring frequencies listed in Table 1 to subpart A of this part in lieu of the monitoring frequency specified for regulated equipment in the applicable subpart. Reduced monitoring frequencies for good performance are not applicable when using the alternative work practice.
              
              (6) When this alternative work practice is used for detecting leaking equipment the following are not applicable for the equipment being monitored:
              (i) Skip period leak detection and repair;
              (ii) Quality improvement plans; or
              (iii) Complying with standards for allowable percentage of valves and pumps to leak.
              (7) When the alternative work practice is used to detect leaking equipment, the regulated equipment in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section must also be monitored annually using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor at the leak definition required in the applicable subpart. The owner or operator may choose the specific monitoring period (for example, first quarter) to conduct the annual monitoring. Subsequent monitoring must be conducted every 12 months from the initial period. Owners or operators must keep records of the annual Method 21 screening results, as specified in paragraph (i)(4)(vii) of this section.
              (i) An owner or operator of an affected source who chooses to use the alternative work practice must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(5) of this section.
              (1) Instrument Specifications. The optical gas imaging instrument must comply with the requirements in (i)(1)(i) and (i)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (i) Provide the operator with an image of the potential leak points for each piece of equipment at both the detection sensitivity level and within the distance used in the daily instrument check described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The detection sensitivity level depends upon the frequency at which leak monitoring is to be performed.
              (ii) Provide a date and time stamp for video records of every monitoring event.
              (2) Daily Instrument Check. On a daily basis, and prior to beginning any leak monitoring work, test the optical gas imaging instrument at the mass flow rate determined in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(ii) through (i)(2)(iv) of this section for each camera configuration used during monitoring (for example, different lenses used), unless an alternative method to demonstrate daily instrument checks has been approved in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(v) of this section.
              (i) Calculate the mass flow rate to be used in the daily instrument check by following the procedures in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) and (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
              (A) For a specified population of equipment to be imaged by the instrument, determine the piece of equipment in contact with the lowest mass fraction of chemicals that are detectable, within the distance to be used in paragraph (i)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, at or below the standard detection sensitivity level.
              (B) Multiply the standard detection sensitivity level, corresponding to the selected monitoring frequency in Table 1 of subpart A of this part, by the mass fraction of detectable chemicals from the stream identified in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(A) of this section to determine the mass flow rate to be used in the daily instrument check, using the following equation.
              
                ER22DE08.007
              
              
                Where:
                
                Edic = Mass flow rate for the daily instrument check, grams per hour
                xi = Mass fraction of detectable chemical(s) i seen by the optical gas imaging instrument, within the distance to be used in paragraph (i)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, at or below the standard detection sensitivity level, Esds.
                Esds = Standard detection sensitivity level from Table 1 to subpart A, grams per hour
                k = Total number of detectable chemicals emitted from the leaking equipment and seen by the optical gas imaging instrument.
              
              
              (ii) Start the optical gas imaging instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring that all appropriate settings conform to the manufacturer's instructions.
              (iii) Use any gas chosen by the user that can be viewed by the optical gas imaging instrument and that has a purity of no less than 98 percent.

              (iv) Establish a mass flow rate by using the following procedures:
              
              (A) Provide a source of gas where it will be in the field of view of the optical gas imaging instrument.
              (B) Set up the optical gas imaging instrument at a recorded distance from the outlet or leak orifice of the flow meter that will not be exceeded in the actual performance of the leak survey. Do not exceed the operating parameters of the flow meter.
              (C) Open the valve on the flow meter to set a flow rate that will create a mass emission rate equal to the mass rate specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section while observing the gas flow through the optical gas imaging instrument viewfinder. When an image of the gas emission is seen through the viewfinder at the required emission rate, make a record of the reading on the flow meter.
              (v) Repeat the procedures specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(ii) through (i)(2)(iv) of this section for each configuration of the optical gas imaging instrument used during the leak survey.
              (vi) To use an alternative method to demonstrate daily instrument checks, apply to the Administrator for approval of the alternative under § 60.13(i).
              (3) Leak Survey Procedure. Operate the optical gas imaging instrument to image every regulated piece of equipment selected for this work practice in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's operating parameters. All emissions imaged by the optical gas imaging instrument are considered to be leaks and are subject to repair. All emissions visible to the naked eye are also considered to be leaks and are subject to repair.
              (4) Recordkeeping. You must keep the records described in paragraphs (i)(4)(i) through (i)(4)(vii) of this section:
              (i) The equipment, processes, and facilities for which the owner or operator chooses to use the alternative work practice.
              (ii) The detection sensitivity level selected from Table 1 to subpart A of this part for the optical gas imaging instrument.
              (iii) The analysis to determine the piece of equipment in contact with the lowest mass fraction of chemicals that are detectable, as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
              (iv) The technical basis for the mass fraction of detectable chemicals used in the equation in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
              (v) The daily instrument check. Record the distance, per paragraph (i)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, and the flow meter reading, per paragraph (i)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, at which the leak was imaged. Keep a video record of the daily instrument check for each configuration of the optical gas imaging instrument used during the leak survey (for example, the daily instrument check must be conducted for each lens used). The video record must include a time and date stamp for each daily instrument check. The video record must be kept for 5 years.
              (vi) Recordkeeping requirements in the applicable subpart. A video record must be used to document the leak survey results. The video record must include a time and date stamp for each monitoring event. A video record can be used to meet the recordkeeping requirements of the applicable subparts if each piece of regulated equipment selected for this work practice can be identified in the video record. The video record must be kept for 5 years.
              (vii) The results of the annual Method 21 screening required in paragraph (h)(7) of this section. Records must be kept for all regulated equipment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Records must identify the equipment screened, the screening value measured by Method 21, the time and date of the screening, and calibration information required in the existing applicable subpart.

              (5) Reporting. Submit the reports required in the applicable subpart. Submit the records of the annual Method 21 screening required in paragraph (h)(7) of this section to the Administrator via e-mail to CCG-AWP@EPA.GOV.

              § 60.19
              General notification and reporting requirements.

              (a) For the purposes of this part, time periods specified in days shall be measured in calendar days, even if the word “calendar” is absent, unless otherwise specified in an applicable requirement.
              (b) For the purposes of this part, if an explicit postmark deadline is not specified in an applicable requirement for the submittal of a notification, application, report, or other written communication to the Administrator, the owner or operator shall postmark the submittal on or before the number of days specified in the applicable requirement. For example, if a notification must be submitted 15 days before a particular event is scheduled to take place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days preceding the event; likewise, if a notification must be submitted 15 days after a particular event takes place, the notification shall be delivered or postmarked on or before 15 days following the end of the event. The use of reliable non-Government mail carriers that provide indications of verifiable delivery of information required to be submitted to the Administrator, similar to the postmark provided by the U.S. Postal Service, or alternative means of delivery, including the use of electronic media, agreed to by the permitting authority, is acceptable.
              (c) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (d) If an owner or operator of an affected facility in a State with delegated authority is required to submit periodic reports under this part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the submission of periodic reports that is consistent with the reporting frequency(ies) specified for such facility under this part, the owner or operator may change the dates by which periodic reports under this part shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the State. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the affected facility is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (e) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary sources affected by standards set under this part and standards set under part 61, part 63, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a common schedule on which periodic reports required by each applicable standard shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the stationary source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part, or 1 year after the stationary source is required to be in compliance with the applicable 40 CFR part 61 or part 63 of this chapter standard, whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (f)(1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
              (ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section each time he or she wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline specified in this part.

              (2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
              (3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request.
              (4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.

              Applicability.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to States upon publication of a final guideline document under § 60.22(a).
            
            
              § 60.21
              Definitions.
              Terms used but not defined in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A:
              (a) Designated pollutant means any air pollutant, the emissions of which are subject to a standard of performance for new stationary sources, but for which air quality criteria have not been issued and that is not included on a list published under section 108(a) or section 112(b)(1)(A) of the Act.
              (b) Designated facility means any existing facility (see § 60.2(aa)) which emits a designated pollutant and which would be subject to a standard of performance for that pollutant if the existing facility were an affected facility (see § 60.2(e)).
              (c) Plan means a plan under section 111(d) of the Act which establishes emission standards for designated pollutants from designated facilities and provides for the implementation and enforcement of such emission standards.
              (d) Applicable plan means the plan, or most recent revision thereof, which has been approved under § 60.27(b) or promulgated under § 60.27(d).
              (e) Emission guideline means a guideline set forth in subpart C of this part, or in a final guideline document published under § 60.22(a), which reflects the degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of such reduction) the Administrator has determined has been adequately demonstrated for designated facilities.
              (f) Emission standard means a legally enforceable regulation setting forth an allowable rate of emissions into the atmosphere, establishing an allowance system, or prescribing equipment specifications for control of air pollution emissions.
              (g) Compliance schedule means a legally enforceable schedule specifying a date or dates by which a source or category of sources must comply with specific emission standards contained in a plan or with any increments of progress to achieve such compliance.
              (h) Increments of progress means steps to achieve compliance which must be taken by an owner or operator of a designated facility, including:
              
              (1) Submittal of a final control plan for the designated facility to the appropriate air pollution control agency;
              (2) Awarding of contracts for emission control systems or for process modifications, or issuance of orders for the purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control or process modification;
              (3) Initiation of on-site construction or installation of emission control equipment or process change;
              (4) Completion of on-site construction or installation of emission control equipment or process change; and
              (5) Final compliance.
              (i) Region means an air quality control region designated under section 107 of the Act and described in part 81 of this chapter.

              § 60.22
              Publication of guideline documents, emission guidelines, and final compliance times.

              (a) Concurrently upon or after proposal of standards of performance for the control of a designated pollutant from affected facilities, the Administrator will publish a draft guideline document containing information pertinent to control of the designated pollutant form designated facilities. Notice of the availability of the draft guideline document will be published in the Federal Register and public comments on its contents will be invited. After consideration of public comments and upon or after promulgation of standards of performance for control of a designated pollutant from affected facilities, a final guideline document will be published and notice of its availability will be published in the Federal Register.
              
              (b) Guideline documents published under this section will provide information for the development of State plans, such as:
              (1) Information concerning known or suspected endangerment of public health or welfare caused, or contributed to, by the designated pollutant.
              (2) A description of systems of emission reduction which, in the judgment of the Administrator, have been adequately demonstrated.
              (3) Information on the degree of emission reduction which is achievable with each system, together with information on the costs and environmental effects of applying each system to designated facilities.
              (4) Incremental periods of time normally expected to be necessary for the design, installation, and startup of identified control systems.
              (5) An emission guideline that reflects the application of the best system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) that has been adequately demonstrated for designated facilities, and the time within which compliance with emission standards of equivalent stringency can be achieved. The Administrator will specify different emission guidelines or compliance times or both for different sizes, types, and classes of designated facilities when costs of control, physical limitations, geographical location, or similar factors make subcategorization appropriate. (6) Such other available information as the Administrator determines may contribute to the formulation of State plans.
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the emission guidelines and compliance times referred to in paragraph (b)(5) of this section will be proposed for comment upon publication of the draft guideline document, and after consideration of comments will be promulgated in subpart C of this part with such modifications as may be appropriate.

              (d)(1) If the Administrator determines that a designated pollutant may cause or contribute to endangerment of public welfare, but that adverse effects on public health have not been demonstrated, he will include the determination in the draft guideline document and in the Federal Register notice of its availability. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, paragraph (c) of this section shall be inapplicable in such cases.

              (2) If the Administrator determines at any time on the basis of new information that a prior determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is incorrect or no longer correct, he will publish notice of the determination in the Federal Register, revise the guideline document as necessary under paragraph (a) of this section, and propose and promulgate emission guidelines and compliance times under paragraph (c) of this section.

              § 60.23
              Adoption and submittal of State plans; public hearings.
              (a)(1) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, within 9 months after notice of the availability of a final guideline document is published under § 60.22(a), each State shall adopt and submit to the Administrator, in accordance with § 60.4 of subpart A of this part, a plan for the control of the designated pollutant to which the guideline document applies.
              (2) Within nine months after notice of the availability of a final revised guideline document is published as provided in § 60.22(d)(2), each State shall adopt and submit to the Administrator any plan revision necessary to meet the requirements of this subpart.
              (b) If no designated facility is located within a State, the State shall submit a letter of certification to that effect to the Administrator within the time specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Such certification shall exempt the State from the requirements of this subpart for that designated pollutant.
              (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, the State shall, prior to the adoption of any plan or revision thereof, conduct one or more public hearings within the State on such plan or plan revision.
              (2) No hearing shall be required for any change to an increment of progress in an approved compliance schedule unless the change is likely to cause the facility to be unable to comply with the final compliance date in the schedule.
              (3) No hearing shall be required on an emission standard in effect prior to the effective date of this subpart if it was adopted after a public hearing and is at least as stringent as the corresponding emission guideline specified in the applicable guideline document published under § 60.22(a).
              (d) Any hearing required by paragraph (c) of this section shall be held only after reasonable notice. Notice shall be given at least 30 days prior to the date of such hearing and shall include:
              (1) Notification to the public by prominently advertising the date, time, and place of such hearing in each region affected;
              (2) Availability, at the time of public announcement, of each proposed plan or revision thereof for public inspection in at least one location in each region to which it will apply;
              (3) Notification to the Administrator;
              (4) Notification to each local air pollution control agency in each region to which the plan or revision will apply; and
              (5) In the case of an interstate region, notification to any other State included in the region.
              (e) The State shall prepare and retain, for a minimum of 2 years, a record of each hearing for inspection by any interested party. The record shall contain, as a minimum, a list of witnesses together with the text of each presentation.
              (f) The State shall submit with the plan or revision:
              (1) Certification that each hearing required by paragraph (c) of this section was held in accordance with the notice required by paragraph (d) of this section; and
              (2) A list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.

              (g) Upon written application by a State agency (through the appropriate Regional Office), the Administrator may approve State procedures designed to insure public participation in the matters for which hearings are required and public notification of the opportunity to participate if, in the judgment of the Administrator, the procedures, although different from the requirements of this subpart, in fact provide for adequate notice to and participation of the public. The Administrator may impose such conditions on his approval as he deems necessary. Procedures approved under this section shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this subpart regarding procedures for public hearings.

              § 60.24
              Emission standards and compliance schedules.
              (a) Each plan shall include emission standards and compliance schedules.
              (b) (1) Emission standards shall either be based on an allowance system or prescribe allowable rates of emissions except when it is clearly impracticable. Such cases will be identified in the guideline documents issued under § 60.22. Where emission standards prescribing equipment specifications are established, the plan shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emission reductions achievable by implementation of such specifications, and may permit compliance by the use of equipment determined by the State to be equivalent to that prescribed.
              (2) Test methods and procedures for determining compliance with the emission standards shall be specified in the plan. Methods other than those specified in appendix A to this part may be specified in the plan if shown to be equivalent or alternative methods as defined in § 60.2 (t) and (u).
              (3) Emission standards shall apply to all designated facilities within the State. A plan may contain emission standards adopted by local jurisdictions provided that the standards are enforceable by the State.
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, where the Administrator has determined that a designated pollutant may cause or contribute to endangerment of public health, emission standards shall be no less stringent than the corresponding emission guideline(s) specified in subpart C of this part, and final compliance shall be required as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the compliance times specified in subpart C of this part.
              (d) Where the Administrator has determined that a designated pollutant may cause or contribute to endangerment of public welfare but that adverse effects on public health have not been demonstrated, States may balance the emission guidelines, compliance times, and other information provided in the applicable guideline document against other factors of public concern in establishing emission standards, compliance schedules, and variances. Appropriate consideration shall be given to the factors specified in § 60.22(b) and to information presented at the public hearing(s) conducted under § 60.23(c).
              (e)(1) Any compliance schedule extending more than 12 months from the date required for submittal of the plan must include legally enforceable increments of progress to achieve compliance for each designated facility or category of facilities. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, increments of progress must include, where practicable, each increment of progress specified in § 60.21(h) and must include such additional increments of progress as may be necessary to permit close and effective supervision of progress toward final compliance.
              (2) A plan may provide that compliance schedules for individual sources or categories of sources will be formulated after plan submittal. Any such schedule shall be the subject of a public hearing held according to § 60.23 and shall be submitted to the Administrator within 60 days after the date of adoption of the schedule but in no case later than the date prescribed for submittal of the first semiannual report required by § 60.25(e).
              (f) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart on a case-by-case basis for particular designated facilities or classes of facilities, States may provide for the application of less stringent emissions standards or longer compliance schedules than those otherwise required by paragraph (c) of this section, provided that the State demonstrates with respect to each such facility (or class of facilities):
              (1) Unreasonable cost of control resulting from plant age, location, or basic process design;
              (2) Physical impossibility of installing necessary control equipment; or

              (3) Other factors specific to the facility (or class of facilities) that make application of a less stringent standard or final compliance time significantly more reasonable.
              
              (g) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to preclude any State or political subdivision thereof from adopting or enforcing (1) emission standards more stringent than emission guidelines specified in subpart C of this part or in applicable guideline documents or (2) compliance schedules requiring final compliance at earlier times than those specified in subpart C or in applicable guideline documents.

              Emission inventories, source surveillance, reports.
              (a) Each plan shall include an inventory of all designated facilities, including emission data for the designated pollutants and information related to emissions as specified in appendix D to this part. Such data shall be summarized in the plan, and emission rates of designated pollutants from designated facilities shall be correlated with applicable emission standards. As used in this subpart, “correlated” means presented in such a manner as to show the relationship between measured or estimated amounts of emissions and the amounts of such emissions allowable under applicable emission standards.
              (b) Each plan shall provide for monitoring the status of compliance with applicable emission standards. Each plan shall, as a minimum, provide for:
              (1) Legally enforceable procedures for requiring owners or operators of designated facilities to maintain records and periodically report to the State information on the nature and amount of emissions from such facilities, and/or such other information as may be necessary to enable the State to determine whether such facilities are in compliance with applicable portions of the plan. Submission of electronic documents shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).
              (2) Periodic inspection and, when applicable, testing of designated facilities.
              (c) Each plan shall provide that information obtained by the State under paragraph (b) of this section shall be correlated with applicable emission standards (see § 60.25(a)) and made available to the general public.
              (d) The provisions referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be specifically identified. Copies of such provisions shall be submitted with the plan unless:
              (1) They have been approved as portions of a preceding plan submitted under this subpart or as portions of an implementation plan submitted under section 110 of the Act, and
              (2) The State demonstrates:
              (i) That the provisions are applicable to the designated pollutant(s) for which the plan is submitted, and
              (ii) That the requirements of § 60.26 are met.
              (e) The State shall submit reports on progress in plan enforcement to the Administrator on an annual (calendar year) basis, commencing with the first full report period after approval of a plan or after promulgation of a plan by the Administrator. Information required under this paragraph must be included in the annual report required by § 51.321 of this chapter.
              (f) Each progress report shall include:
              (1) Enforcement actions initiated against designated facilities during the reporting period, under any emission standard or compliance schedule of the plan.
              (2) Identification of the achievement of any increment of progress required by the applicable plan during the reporting period.
              (3) Identification of designated facilities that have ceased operation during the reporting period.
              (4) Submission of emission inventory data as described in paragraph (a) of this section for designated facilities that were not in operation at the time of plan development but began operation during the reporting period.
              (5) Submission of additional data as necessary to update the information submitted under paragraph (a) of this section or in previous progress reports.

              (6) Submission of copies of technical reports on all performance testing on designated facilities conducted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, complete with concurrently recorded process data.

              § 60.26
              Legal authority.
              (a) Each plan shall show that the State has legal authority to carry out the plan, including authority to:
              (1) Adopt emission standards and compliance schedules applicable to designated facilities.
              (2) Enforce applicable laws, regulations, standards, and compliance schedules, and seek injunctive relief.
              (3) Obtain information necessary to determine whether designated facilities are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, and compliance schedules, including authority to require recordkeeping and to make inspections and conduct tests of designated facilities.
              (4) Require owners or operators of designated facilities to install, maintain, and use emission monitoring devices and to make periodic reports to the State on the nature and amounts of emissions from such facilities; also authority for the State to make such data available to the public as reported and as correlated with applicable emission standards.
              (b) The provisions of law or regulations which the State determines provide the authorities required by this section shall be specifically identified. Copies of such laws or regulations shall be submitted with the plan unless:
              (1) They have been approved as portions of a preceding plan submitted under this subpart or as portions of an implementation plan submitted under section 110 of the Act, and
              (2) The State demonstrates that the laws or regulations are applicable to the designated pollutant(s) for which the plan is submitted.
              (c) The plan shall show that the legal authorities specified in this section are available to the State at the time of submission of the plan. Legal authority adequate to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section may be delegated to the State under section 114 of the Act.
              (d) A State governmental agency other than the State air pollution control agency may be assigned responsibility for carrying out a portion of a plan if the plan demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the State governmental agency has the legal authority necessary to carry out that portion of the plan.
              (e) The State may authorize a local agency to carry out a plan, or portion thereof, within the local agency's jurisdiction if the plan demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the local agency has the legal authority necessary to implement the plan or portion thereof, and that the authorization does not relieve the State of responsibility under the Act for carrying out the plan or portion thereof.
            
            
              § 60.27
              Actions by the Administrator.
              (a) The Administrator may, whenever he determines necessary, extend the period for submission of any plan or plan revision or portion thereof.
              (b) After receipt of a plan or plan revision, the Administrator will propose the plan or revision for approval or disapproval. The Administrator will, within four months after the date required for submission of a plan or plan revision, approve or disapprove such plan or revision or each portion thereof.
              (c) The Administrator will, after consideration of any State hearing record, promptly prepare and publish proposed regulations setting forth a plan, or portion thereof, for a State if:
              (1) The State fails to submit a plan within the time prescribed;
              (2) The State fails to submit a plan revision required by § 60.23(a)(2) within the time prescribed; or
              (3) The Administrator disapproves the State plan or plan revision or any portion thereof, as unsatisfactory because the requirements of this subpart have not been met.

              (d) The Administrator will, within six months after the date required for submission of a plan or plan revision, promulgate the regulations proposed under paragraph (c) of this section with such modifications as may be appropriate unless, prior to such promulgation, the State has adopted and submitted a plan or plan revision which the Administrator determines to be approvable.
              (e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, regulations proposed and promulgated by the Administrator under this section will prescribe emission standards of the same stringency as the corresponding emission guideline(s) specified in the final guideline document published under § 60.22(a) and will require final compliance with such standards as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the times specified in the guideline document.
              (2) Upon application by the owner or operator of a designated facility to which regulations proposed and promulgated under this section will apply, the Administrator may provide for the application of less stringent emission standards or longer compliance schedules than those otherwise required by this section in accordance with the criteria specified in § 60.24(f).
              (f) Prior to promulgation of a plan under paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrator will provide the opportunity for at least one public hearing in either:

              Definitions.
              Terms used but not defined in this subpart have the meaning given them in the Act and in subparts A, B, and WWW of this part.
              
                Municipal solid waste landfill or MSW landfill means an entire disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household waste is placed in or on land. An MSW landfill may also receive other types of RCRA Subtitle D wastes such as commercial solid waste, nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW landfill may be separated by access roads. An MSW landfill may be publicly or privately owned. An MSW landfill may be a new MSW landfill, an existing MSW landfill or a lateral expansion.
            
            
              § 60.32c
              Designated facilities.
              (a) The designated facility to which the guidelines apply is each existing MSW landfill for which construction, reconstruction or modification was commenced before May 30, 1991.
              (b) Physical or operational changes made to an existing MSW landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing MSW landfill to the requirements of subpart WWW [see § 60.750 of subpart WWW].
              (c) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Act, the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters on the effective date of EPA approval of the State's program under section 111(d) of the Act, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of §§ 70.5(a)(1)(i) or 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter 90 days after the effective date of such 111(d) program approval, even if the design capacity report is submitted earlier.

              (d) When a MSW landfill subject to this subpart is closed, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met.
              (1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control system under § 60.33c(c) of this subpart; or
              (2) The owner or operator meets the conditions for control system removal specified in § 60.752(b)(2)(v) of subpart WWW.

              (1) Install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate a device for measuring and recording the temperature of the secondary chamber on a continuous basis, the output of which shall be recorded, at a minimum, once every minute throughout operation.
              (2) Install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate a device which automatically measures and records the date, time, and weight of each charge fed into the HMIWI.
              (3) The owner or operator of a designated facility shall obtain monitoring data at all times during HMIWI operation except during periods of monitoring equipment malfunction, calibration, or repair. At a minimum, valid monitoring data shall be obtained for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating hours per calendar quarter that the designated facility is combusting hospital waste and/or medical/infectious waste.
              (f) The owner or operator of a designated facility as defined in § 60.32e(a)(1) or (a)(2) subject to emissions limits under § 60.33e(a)(2), (a)(3), or (b)(2) may use the results of previous emissions tests to demonstrate compliance with the emissions limits, provided that the conditions in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section are met:
              (1) The designated facility's previous emissions tests must have been conducted using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 60.56c(b) of subpart Ec of this part. Previous emissions test results obtained using EPA-accepted voluntary consensus standards are also acceptable.

              (2) The HMIWI at the designated facility shall currently be operated in a manner (e.g., with charge rate, secondary chamber temperature, etc.) that would be expected to result in the same or lower emissions than observed during the previous emissions test(s), and the HMIWI may not have been modified such that emissions would be expected to exceed (notwithstanding normal test-to-test variability) the results from previous emissions test(s).
              (3) The previous emissions test(s) must have been conducted in 1996 or later.

              § 60.30f
              Scope and delegated authorities.
              This subpart establishes Emission Guidelines and compliance times for the control of designated pollutants from certain designated municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part.
              (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a state or United States protectorate with one or more existing MSW landfills that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction on or before July 17, 2014, you must submit a state plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the Emission Guidelines contained in this subpart. The requirements for state plans are specified in subpart B of this part.
              (b) You must submit a state plan to EPA by May 30, 2017.
              (c) The following authorities will not be delegated to state, local, or tribal agencies:
              (1) Approval of alternative methods to determine the NMOC concentration or a site-specific methane generation rate constant (k).
              (2) [Reserved]
            
            
              § 60.31f
              Designated facilities.
              (a) The designated facility to which these Emission Guidelines apply is each existing MSW landfill for which construction, reconstruction, or modification was commenced on or before July 17, 2014.
              (b) Physical or operational changes made to an existing MSW landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing MSW landfill to the requirements of a standard of performance for new MSW landfills.

              (c) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters on the effective date of EPA approval of the state's program under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter 90 days after the effective date of such section 111(d) program approval, even if the design capacity report is submitted earlier.
              (d) When an MSW landfill subject to this subpart is closed as defined in this subpart, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:
              (1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement to install and operate a gas collection and control system under § 60.33f; or
              (2) The landfill meets the conditions for control system removal specified in § 60.33f(f).
              (e) When an MSW landfill subject to this subpart is in the closed landfill subcategory, the owner or operator is not subject to the following reports of this subpart, provided the owner or operator submitted these reports under the provisions of subpart WWW of this part; 40 CFR part 62, subpart GGG; or a state plan implementing subpart Cc of this part on or before July 17, 2014:
              (1) Initial design capacity report specified in § 60.38f(a).
              (2) Initial or subsequent NMOC emission rate report specified in § 60.38f(c), provided that the most recent NMOC emission rate report indicated the NMOC emissions were below 50 Mg/yr.
              (3) Collection and control system design plan specified in § 60.38f(d).
              (4) Closure report specified in § 60.38f(f).

              Compliance times.
              Planning, awarding of contracts, installing, and starting up MSW landfill air emission collection and control equipment that is capable of meeting the Emission Guidelines under § 60.33f must be completed within 30 months after the date an NMOC emission rate report shows NMOC emissions equal or exceed 34 megagrams per year (50 megagrams per year for the closed landfill subcategory); or within 30 months after the date of the most recent NMOC emission rate report that shows NMOC emissions equal or exceed 34 megagrams per year (50 megagrams per year for the closed landfill subcategory), if Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring shows a surface emission concentration of 500 parts per million methane or greater.
            
            
              § 60.33f
              Emission Guidelines for municipal solid waste landfill emissions.
              (a) Landfills. For approval, a state plan must require each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams by mass and 2.5 million cubic meters by volume to collect and control MSW landfill emissions at each MSW landfill that meets the following conditions:
              (1) The landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987, or has additional design capacity available for future waste deposition.
              (2) The landfill commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before July 17, 2014.
              (3) The landfill has an NMOC emission rate greater than or equal to 34 megagrams per year or Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring shows a surface emission concentration of 500 parts per million methane or greater.

              (4) The landfill in the closed landfill subcategory and has an NMOC emission rate greater than or equal to 50 megagrams per year or Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring shows a surface emission concentration of 500 parts per million methane or greater.
              
              (b) Collection system. For approval, a state plan must include provisions for the installation of a gas collection and control system meeting the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) and (c) of this section at each MSW landfill meeting the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (1) Collection system. Install and start up a collection and control system that captures the gas generated within the landfill within 30 months after:
              (i) The first annual report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year, unless Tier 2 or Tier 3 sampling demonstrates that the NMOC emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, as specified in § 60.38f(d)(4); or
              (ii) The first annual NMOC emission rate report for a landfill in the closed landfill subcategory in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams per year, unless Tier 2 or Tier 3 sampling demonstrates that the NMOC emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, as specified in § 60.38f(d)(4); or
              (iii) The most recent NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year based on Tier 2, if the Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring shows a surface methane emission concentration of 500 parts per million methane or greater as specified in § 60.38f(d)(4)(iii).
              (2) Active. An active collection system must:
              (i) Be designed to handle the maximum expected gas flow rate from the entire area of the landfill that warrants control over the intended use period of the gas control system equipment.
              (ii) Collect gas from each area, cell, or group of cells in the landfill in which the initial solid waste has been placed for a period of 5 years or more if active; or 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.
              (iii) Collect gas at a sufficient extraction rate.
              (iv) Be designed to minimize off-site migration of subsurface gas.
              (3) Passive. A passive collection system must:
              (i) Comply with the provisions specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section.
              (ii) Be installed with liners on the bottom and all sides in all areas in which gas is to be collected. The liners must be installed as required under § 258.40 of this chapter.
              (c) Control system. For approval, a state plan must include provisions for the control of the gas collected from within the landfill through the use of control devices meeting the following requirements, except as provided in § 60.24.
              (1) A non-enclosed flare designed and operated in accordance with the parameters established in § 60.18 except as noted in § 60.37f(d); or
              (2) A control system designed and operated to reduce NMOC by 98 weight percent; or when an enclosed combustion device is used for control, to either reduce NMOC by 98 weight percent or reduce the outlet NMOC concentration to less than 20 parts per million by volume, dry basis as hexane at 3 percent oxygen or less. The reduction efficiency or concentration in parts per million by volume must be established by an initial performance test to be completed no later than 180 days after the initial startup of the approved control system using the test methods specified in § 60.35f(d). The performance test is not required for boilers and process heaters with design heat input capacities equal to or greater than 44 megawatts that burn landfill gas for compliance with this subpart.
              (i) If a boiler or process heater is used as the control device, the landfill gas stream must be introduced into the flame zone.
              (ii) The control device must be operated within the parameter ranges established during the initial or most recent performance test. The operating parameters to be monitored are specified in § 60.37f.

              (iii) For the closed landfill subcategory, the initial or most recent performance test conducted to comply with subpart WWW of this part; 40 CFR part 62, subpart GGG; or a state plan implementing subpart Cc of this part on or before July 17, 2014 is sufficient for compliance with this subpart.
              
              (3) Route the collected gas to a treatment system that processes the collected gas for subsequent sale or beneficial use such as fuel for combustion, production of vehicle fuel, production of high-Btu gas for pipeline injection, or use as a raw material in a chemical manufacturing process. Venting of treated landfill gas to the ambient air is not allowed. If the treated landfill gas cannot be routed for subsequent sale or beneficial use, then the treated landfill gas must be controlled according to either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
              (4) All emissions from any atmospheric vent from the gas treatment system are subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. For purposes of this subpart, atmospheric vents located on the condensate storage tank are not part of the treatment system and are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
              (d) Design capacity. For approval, a state plan must require each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams by mass or 2.5 million cubic meters by volume to submit an initial design capacity report to the Administrator as provided in § 60.38f(a). The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. Any density conversions must be documented and submitted with the report. Submittal of the initial design capacity report fulfills the requirements of this subpart except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

              (1) The owner or operator must submit an amended design capacity report as provided in § 60.38f(b).
              
              
                Note to paragraph (d)(1):
                Note that if the design capacity increase is the result of a modification, as defined in this subpart, that was commenced after July 17, 2014, then the landfill becomes subject to subpart XXX of this part instead of this subpart. If the design capacity increase is the result of a change in operating practices, density, or some other change that is not a modification as defined in this subpart, then the landfill remains subject to this subpart.
              
              
              (2) When an increase in the maximum design capacity of a landfill with an initial design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters results in a revised maximum design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, the owner or operator must comply with paragraph (e) of this section.
              (e) Emissions. For approval, a state plan must require each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters to either install a collection and control system as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section or calculate an initial NMOC emission rate for the landfill using the procedures specified in § 60.35f(a). The NMOC emission rate must be recalculated annually, except as provided in § 60.38f(c)(3).
              (1) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must:
              (i) Submit an annual NMOC emission rate report according to § 60.38f(c), except as provided in § 60.38f(c)(3); and
              (ii) Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the procedures specified in § 60.35f(a) until such time as the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, or the landfill is closed.
              (A) If the calculated NMOC emission rate, upon initial calculation or annual recalculation required in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either: Comply with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section; calculate NMOC emissions using the next higher tier in § 60.35f; or conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the procedures specified in § 60.35f(a)(6).
              (B) If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure report must be submitted to the Administrator as provided in § 60.38f(f), except for exemption allowed under § 60.31f(e)(4).

              (C) For the closed landfill subcategory, if the most recently calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either: Submit a gas collection and control system design plan as specified in § 60.38f(d), except for exemptions allowed under § 60.31f(e)(3), and install a collection and control system as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section; calculate NMOC emissions using the next higher tier in § 60.35f; or conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the procedures specified in § 60.35f(a)(6).
              (2) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year using Tier 1, 2, or 3 procedures, the owner or operator must either: submit a collection and control system design plan prepared by a professional engineer to the Administrator within 1 year as specified in § 60.38f(d), except for exemptions allowed under § 60.31f(e)(3); calculate NMOC emissions using a higher tier in § 60.35f; or conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the procedures specified in § 60.35f(a)(6).
              (3) For the closed landfill subcategory, if the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year using Tier 1, 2, or 3 procedures, the owner or operator must either: Submit a collection and control system design plan as specified in § 60.38f(d), except for exemptions allowed under § 60.31f(e)(3); calculate NMOC emissions using a higher tier in § 60.35f; or conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the procedures specified in § 60.35f(a)(6).
              (f) Removal criteria. The collection and control system may be capped, removed, or decommissioned if the following criteria are met:
              (1) The landfill is a closed landfill (as defined in § 60.41f). A closure report must be submitted to the Administrator as provided in § 60.38f(f).
              (2) The collection and control system has been in operation a minimum of 15 years or the landfill owner or operator demonstrates that the GCCS will be unable to operate for 15 years due to declining gas flow.
              (3) Following the procedures specified in § 60.35f(b), the calculated NMOC emission rate at the landfill is less than 34 megagrams per year on three successive test dates. The test dates must be no less than 90 days apart, and no more than 180 days apart.
              (4) For the closed landfill subcategory (as defined in § 60.41), following the procedures specified in § 60.35f(b), the calculated NMOC emission rate at the landfill is less than 50 megagrams per year on three successive test dates. The test dates must be no less than 90 days apart, and no more than 180 days apart.
            
            
              § 60.34f
              Operational standards for collection and control systems.
              For approval, a state plan must include provisions for the operational standards in this section for an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 60.33f(b) and (c). Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 60.33f(b) and (c) must:
              (a) Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid waste has been in place for:
              (1) Five (5) years or more if active; or
              (2) Two (2) years or more if closed or at final grade.
              (b) Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each wellhead except under the following conditions:
              (1) A fire or increased well temperature. The owner or operator must record instances when positive pressure occurs in efforts to avoid a fire. These records must be submitted with the annual reports as provided in § 60.38f(h)(1).
              (2) Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator must develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan.
              (3) A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design changes must be approved by the Administrator as specified in § 60.38f(d).

              (c) Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a landfill gas temperature less than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature value at a particular well. A higher operating value demonstration must be submitted to the Administrator for approval and must include supporting data demonstrating that the elevated parameter neither causes fires nor significantly inhibits anaerobic decomposition by killing methanogens. The demonstration must satisfy both criteria in order to be approved (i.e., neither causing fires nor killing methanogens is acceptable).
              (d) Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration is less than 500 parts per million above background at the surface of the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or operator must conduct surface testing using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in § 60.36(d). The owner or operator must conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover and all cover penetrations. Thus, the owner or operator must monitor any openings that are within an area of the landfill where waste has been placed and a gas collection system is required. The owner or operator may establish an alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A surface monitoring design plan must be developed that includes a topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any site-specific deviations from the 30-meter intervals. Areas with steep slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface testing.
              (e) Operate the system such that all collected gases are vented to a control system designed and operated in compliance with § 60.33f(c). In the event the collection or control system is not operating, the gas mover system must be shut down and all valves in the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to the atmosphere must be closed within 1 hour of the collection or control system not operating.
              (f) Operate the control system at all times when the collected gas is routed to the system.
              (g) If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective action must be taken as specified in § 60.36f(a)(3) and (5) or (c). If corrective actions are taken as specified in § 60.36f, the monitored exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements in this section.
            
            
              § 60.35f
              Test methods and procedures.
              For approval, a state plan must include provisions in this section to calculate the landfill NMOC emission rate or to conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration.
              (a)(1) NMOC Emission Rate. The landfill owner or operator must calculate the NMOC emission rate using either Equation 1 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or Equation 2 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. Both Equation 1 and Equation 2 may be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, for part of the life of the landfill and the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is unknown, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, for part of the life of the landfill. The values to be used in both Equation 1 and Equation 2 are 0.05 per year for k, 170 cubic meters per megagram for Lo, and 4,000 parts per million by volume as hexane for the CNMOC. For landfills located in geographical areas with a 30-year annual average precipitation of less than 25 inches, as measured at the nearest representative official meteorologic site, the k value to be used is 0.02 per year.
              (i)(A) Equation 1 must be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known.

                Where:
                
                MNMOC = Total NMOC emission rate from the landfill, megagrams per year.
                
                k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
                Lo = Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
                Mi = Mass of solid waste in the ith section, megagrams.
                ti = Age of the ith section, years.
                CNMOC = Concentration of NMOC, parts per million by volume as hexane.
                3.6 × 10−9 = Conversion factor.
              
              

              (B) The mass of nondegradable solid waste may be subtracted from the total mass of solid waste in a particular section of the landfill when calculating the value for Mi if documentation of the nature and amount of such wastes is maintained.
              (ii)(A) Equation 2 must be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is unknown.
              
                ER29AU16.001
              
              
                Where:
                
                MNMOC = Mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year.
                Lo = Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
                R = Average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year.
                k = Methane generation rate constant, year −1.
                t = Age of landfill, years.
                CNMOC = Concentration of NMOC, parts per million by volume as hexane.

                c = Time since closure, years; for an active landfill c = 0 and e−kc = 1.
                3.6 × 10−9 = Conversion factor.
              
              
              (B) The mass of nondegradable solid waste may be subtracted from the total mass of solid waste in a particular section of the landfill when calculating the value of R, if documentation of the nature and amount of such wastes is maintained.
              (2) Tier 1. The owner or operator must compare the calculated NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 34 megagrams per year.
              (i) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator must submit an NMOC emission rate report according to § 60.38f(c), and must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under § 60.33f(e).
              (ii) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner or operator must either:
              (A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 60.38f(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 60.33f(b) and (c);
              (B) Determine a site-specific NMOC concentration and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the Tier 2 procedures provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or
              (C) Determine a site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the Tier 3 procedures provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
              (3) Tier 2. The landfill owner or operator must determine the site-specific NMOC concentration using the following sampling procedure. The landfill owner or operator must install at least two sample probes per hectare, evenly distributed over the landfill surface that has retained waste for at least 2 years. If the landfill is larger than 25 hectares in area, only 50 samples are required. The probes should be evenly distributed across the sample area. The sample probes should be located to avoid known areas of nondegradable solid waste. The owner or operator must collect and analyze one sample of landfill gas from each probe to determine the NMOC concentration using Method 25 or 25C of appendix A of this part. Taking composite samples from different probes into a single cylinder is allowed; however, equal sample volumes must be taken from each probe. For each composite, the sampling rate, collection times, beginning and ending cylinder vacuums, or alternative volume measurements must be recorded to verify that composite volumes are equal. Composite sample volumes should not be less than one liter unless evidence can be provided to substantiate the accuracy of smaller volumes. Terminate compositing before the cylinder approaches ambient pressure where measurement accuracy diminishes. If more than the required number of samples is taken, all samples must be used in the analysis. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from Method 25 or 25C by six to convert from CNMOC as carbon to CNMOC as hexane. If the landfill has an active or passive gas removal system in place, Method 25 or 25C samples may be collected from these systems instead of surface probes provided the removal system can be shown to provide sampling as representative as the two sampling probe per hectare requirement. For active collection systems, samples may be collected from the common header pipe. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any gas moving, condensate removal, or treatment system equipment. For active collection systems, a minimum of three samples must be collected from the header pipe.
              (i) Within 60 days after the date of determining the NMOC concentration and corresponding NMOC emission rate, the owner or operator must submit the results according to § 60.38f(j)(2).
              (ii) The landfill owner or operator must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate using Equation 1 or Equation 2 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section using the average site-specific NMOC concentration from the collected samples instead of the default value provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (iii) If the resulting NMOC mass emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator must submit a periodic estimate of NMOC emissions in an NMOC emission rate report according to § 60.38f(c), and must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under § 60.33f(e). The site-specific NMOC concentration must be retested every 5 years using the methods specified in this section.
              (iv) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the Tier 2 site-specific NMOC concentration is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either:
              (A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 60.38f(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 60.33f(b) and (c);
              (B) Determine a site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the site-specific methane generation rate using the Tier 3 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section; or
              (C) Conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the Tier 4 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
              (4) Tier 3. The site-specific methane generation rate constant must be determined using the procedures provided in Method 2E of appendix A of this part. The landfill owner or operator must estimate the NMOC mass emission rate using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section and using a site-specific methane generation rate constant, and the site-specific NMOC concentration as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section instead of the default values provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The landfill owner or operator must compare the resulting NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 34 megagrams per year.
              (i) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the Tier 2 site-specific NMOC concentration and Tier 3 site-specific methane generation rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either:
              (A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 60.38f(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 60.33f(b) and (c); or
              (B) Conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the Tier 4 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.

              (ii) If the NMOC mass emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and using the site-specific Tier 2 NMOC concentration and Tier 3 methane generation rate constant and submit a periodic NMOC emission rate report as provided in § 60.38f(c). The calculation of the methane generation rate constant is performed only once, and the value obtained from this test must be used in all subsequent annual NMOC emission rate calculations.
              (5) Other methods. The owner or operator may use other methods to determine the NMOC concentration or a site-specific methane generation rate constant as an alternative to the methods required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
              (6) Tier 4. The landfill owner or operator must demonstrate that surface methane emissions are below 500 parts per million. Surface emission monitoring must be conducted on a quarterly basis using the following procedures. Tier 4 is allowed only if the landfill owner or operator can demonstrate that NMOC emissions are greater than or equal to 34 Mg/yr but less than 50 Mg/yr using Tier 1 or Tier 2. If both Tier 1 and Tier 2 indicate NMOC emissions are 50 Mg/yr or greater, then Tier 4 cannot be used. In addition, the landfill must meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(6)(viii) of this section.
              (i) The owner or operator must measure surface concentrations of methane along the entire perimeter of the landfill and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in § 60.36f(d).
              (ii) The background concentration must be determined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind at least 30 meters from the waste mass boundary of the landfill.
              (iii) Surface emission monitoring must be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that the probe inlet must be placed no more than 5 centimeters above the landfill surface; the constant measurement of distance above the surface should be based on a mechanical device such as with a wheel on a pole.
              (A) The owner or operator must use a wind barrier, similar to a funnel, when onsite average wind speed exceeds 4 miles per hour or 2 meters per second or gust exceeding 10 miles per hour. Average on-site wind speed must also be determined in an open area at 5-minute intervals using an on-site anemometer with a continuous recorder and data logger for the entire duration of the monitoring event. The wind barrier must surround the SEM monitor, and must be placed on the ground, to ensure wind turbulence is blocked. SEM cannot be conducted if average wind speed exceeds 25 miles per hour.
              (B) Landfill surface areas where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover, and all cover penetrations must also be monitored using a device meeting the specifications provided in § 60.36f(d).
              (iv) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the Tier 4 provisions in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must maintain records of surface emission monitoring as provided in § 60.39f(g) and submit a Tier 4 surface emissions report as provided in § 60.38f(d)(4)(iii).
              (v) If there is any measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year of the first measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill according to § 60.38f(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system according to § 60.33f(b) and (c) within 30 months of the most recent NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year based on Tier 2.

              (vi) If after four consecutive quarterly monitoring periods at a landfill, other than a closed landfill, there is no measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must continue quarterly surface emission monitoring using the methods specified in this section.
              
              (vii) If after four consecutive quarterly monitoring periods at a closed landfill there is no measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must conduct annual surface emission monitoring using the methods specified in this section.
              (viii) If a landfill has installed and operates a collection and control system that is not required by this subpart, then the collection and control system must meet the following criteria:
              (A) The gas collection and control system must have operated for at least 6,570 out of 8,760 hours preceding the Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring demonstration.
              (B) During the Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring demonstration, the gas collection and control system must operate as it normally would to collect and control as much landfill gas as possible.
              (b) After the installation and startup of a collection and control system in compliance with this subpart, the owner or operator must calculate the NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be capped, removed, or decommissioned as provided in § 60.33f(f), using Equation 3:
              
                ER29AU16.002
              
              
                Where:
                
                MNMOC = Mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year.
                QLFG = Flow rate of landfill gas, cubic meters per minute.
                CNMOC = NMOC concentration, parts per million by volume as hexane.
              
              
              (1) The flow rate of landfill gas, QLFG, must be determined by measuring the total landfill gas flow rate at the common header pipe that leads to the control system using a gas flow measuring device calibrated according to the provisions of section 10 of Method 2E of appendix A of this part.
              (2) The average NMOC concentration, CNMOC, must be determined by collecting and analyzing landfill gas sampled from the common header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment using the procedures in Method 25 or Method 25C of appendix A of this part. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any condensate removal or other gas refining units. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from Method 25 or Method 25C by six to convert from CNMOC as carbon to CNMOC as hexane.
              (3) The owner or operator may use another method to determine landfill gas flow rate and NMOC concentration if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
              (i) Within 60 days after the date of calculating the NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be capped or removed, the owner or operator must submit the results according to § 60.38f(j)(2).
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (c) When calculating emissions for Prevention of Significant Deterioration purposes, the owner or operator of each MSW landfill subject to the provisions of this subpart must estimate the NMOC emission rate for comparison to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration major source and significance levels in § 51.166 or § 52.21 of this chapter using Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Volume I: Stationary Point and Area Sources (AP-42) or other approved measurement procedures.

              (d) For the performance test required in § 60.33f(c)(1), the net heating value of the combusted landfill gas as determined in § 60.18(f)(3) is calculated from the concentration of methane in the landfill gas as measured by Method 3C. A minimum of three 30-minute Method 3C samples are determined. The measurement of other organic components, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide is not applicable. Method 3C may be used to determine the landfill gas molecular weight for calculating the flare gas exit velocity under § 60.18(f)(4).
              
              (1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 60.8), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance tests required by paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, including any associated fuel analyses, according to § 60.38f(j)(1).
              (2) [Reserved]

              (e) For the performance test required in § 60.33f(c)(2), Method 25 or 25C (Method 25C may be used at the inlet only) of appendix A of this part must be used to determine compliance with the 98 weight-percent efficiency or the 20 parts per million by volume outlet NMOC concentration level, unless another method to demonstrate compliance has been approved by the Administrator as provided by § 60.38f(d)(2). Method 3, 3A, or 3C must be used to determine oxygen for correcting the NMOC concentration as hexane to 3 percent. In cases where the outlet concentration is less than 50 ppm NMOC as carbon (8 ppm NMOC as hexane), Method 25A should be used in place of Method 25. Method 18 may be used in conjunction with Method 25A on a limited basis (compound specific, e.g., methane) or Method 3C may be used to determine methane. The methane as carbon should be subtracted from the Method 25A total hydrocarbon value as carbon to give NMOC concentration as carbon. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration as carbon by 6 to convert the CNMOC as carbon to CNMOC as hexane. Equation 4 must be used to calculate efficiency:
              
                ER29AU16.003
              
              
                Where:
                
                NMOCin = Mass of NMOC entering control device.
                NMOCout = Mass of NMOC exiting control device.
              
              
              (1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 60.8), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, according to § 60.38f(j)(1).
              (2) [Reserved]
            
            
              § 60.36f
              Compliance provisions.
              For approval, a state plan must include the compliance provisions in this section.
              (a) Except as provided in § 60.38f(d)(2), the specified methods in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section must be used to determine whether the gas collection system is in compliance with § 60.33f(b)(2).

              (1) For the purposes of calculating the maximum expected gas generation flow rate from the landfill to determine compliance with § 60.33f(b)(2)(i), either Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section must be used. The methane generation rate constant (k) and methane generation potential (Lo) kinetic factors should be those published in the most recent AP-42 or other site-specific values demonstrated to be appropriate and approved by the Administrator. If k has been determined as specified in § 60.35f(a)(4), the value of k determined from the test must be used. A value of no more than 15 years must be used for the intended use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill is the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until closure.
              (i) For sites with unknown year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:
              
                ER29AU16.004
              
              
                Where:
                
                Qm = Maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters per year.
                
                Lo = Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
                R = Average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year.
                k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
                t = Age of the landfill at equipment installation plus the time the owner or operator intends to use the gas mover equipment or active life of the landfill, whichever is less. If the equipment is installed after closure, t is the age of the landfill at installation, years.

                c = Time since closure, years (for an active landfill c = 0 and e−kc = 1).
              
              
              (ii) For sites with known year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:
              
                ER29AU16.005
              
              
                Where:
                
                QM = Maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters per year.
                k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
                Lo = Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
                Mi = Mass of solid waste in the ith section, megagrams.
                ti = Age of the ith section, years.
              
              
              (iii) If a collection and control system has been installed, actual flow data may be used to project the maximum expected gas generation flow rate instead of, or in conjunction with, Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. If the landfill is still accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal the maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using Equation 5 or Equation 6 or other methods must be used to predict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the intended period of use of the gas control system equipment.
              (2) For the purposes of determining sufficient density of gas collectors for compliance with § 60.33f(b)(2)(ii), the owner or operator must design a system of vertical wells, horizontal collectors, or other collection devices, satisfactory to the Administrator, capable of controlling and extracting gas from all portions of the landfill sufficient to meet all operational and performance standards.
              (3) For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection system flow rate is sufficient to determine compliance with § 60.33f(b)(2)(iii), the owner or operator must measure gauge pressure in the gas collection header applied to each individual well monthly. If a positive pressure exists, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days, except for the three conditions allowed under § 60.34f(b). Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.
              (i) If negative pressure cannot be achieved without excess air infiltration within 15 calendar days of the first measurement of positive pressure, the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after positive pressure was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.39f(e)(3).
              (ii) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the positive pressure measurement for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the positive pressure measurement. The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 60.38f(h)(7) as part of the next annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.39f(e)(4).
              (iii) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 60.38f(h)(7) and (k). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.39f(e)(5).
              (4) [Reserved]
              
              (5) For the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator must monitor each well monthly for temperature as provided in § 60.34f(c). If a well exceeds the operating parameter for temperature, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days. Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.
              (i) If a landfill gas temperature less than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) cannot be achieved within 15 calendar days of the first measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit), the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after a landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.39f(e)(3).
              (ii) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the positive pressure measurement for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 60.38f(h)(7) as part of the next annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.39f(e)(4).
              (iii) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 60.38f(h)(7) and (k). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 60.39f(e)(5).
              (6) An owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.33f(b)(2)(iv) through the use of a collection system not conforming to the specifications provided in § 60.40f must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as specified in § 60.38f(d)(3) demonstrating that off-site migration is being controlled.
              (b) For purposes of compliance with § 60.34f(a), each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must place each well or design component as specified in the approved design plan as provided in § 60.38f(d). Each well must be installed no later than 60 days after the date on which the initial solid waste has been in place for a period of:
              (1) Five (5) years or more if active; or
              (2) Two (2) years or more if closed or at final grade.
              (c) The following procedures must be used for compliance with the surface methane operational standard as provided in § 60.34f(d):
              (1) After installation and startup of the gas collection system, the owner or operator must monitor surface concentrations of methane along the entire perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals (or a site-specific established spacing) for each collection area on a quarterly basis using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) The background concentration must be determined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind outside the boundary of the landfill at a distance of at least 30 meters from the perimeter wells.
              (3) Surface emission monitoring must be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that the probe inlet must be placed within 5 to 10 centimeters of the ground. Monitoring must be performed during typical meteorological conditions.

              (4) Any reading of 500 parts per million or more above background at any location must be recorded as a monitored exceedance and the actions specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section must be taken. As long as the specified actions are taken, the exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements of § 60.34f(d).
              
              (i) The location of each monitored exceedance must be marked and the location and concentration recorded. For location, you must determine the latitude and longitude coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places.
              (ii) Cover maintenance or adjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent wells to increase the gas collection in the vicinity of each exceedance must be made and the location must be re-monitored within 10 calendar days of detecting the exceedance.
              (iii) If the re-monitoring of the location shows a second exceedance, additional corrective action must be taken and the location must be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If the re-monitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section must be taken, and no further monitoring of that location is required until the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section has been taken.
              (iv) Any location that initially showed an exceedance but has a methane concentration less than 500 parts per million methane above background at the 10-day re-monitoring specified in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be re-monitored 1 month from the initial exceedance. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows a concentration less than 500 parts per million above background, no further monitoring of that location is required until the next quarterly monitoring period. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows an exceedance, the actions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) or (v) of this section must be taken.
              (v) For any location where monitored methane concentration equals or exceeds 500 parts per million above background three times within a quarterly period, a new well or other collection device must be installed within 120 calendar days of the initial exceedance. An alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading the blower, header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for installation may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
              (5) The owner or operator must implement a program to monitor for cover integrity and implement cover repairs as necessary on a monthly basis.
              (d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section or § 60.35f(a)(6) must comply with the following instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission monitoring devices:
              (1) The portable analyzer must meet the instrument specifications provided in section 6 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that “methane” replaces all references to “VOC”.
              (2) The calibration gas must be methane, diluted to a nominal concentration of 500 parts per million in air.
              (3) To meet the performance evaluation requirements in section 8.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, the instrument evaluation procedures of section 8.1 of Method 21 must be used.
              (4) The calibration procedures provided in sections 8 and 10 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part must be followed immediately before commencing a surface monitoring survey.
              (e) The provisions of this subpart apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, you must comply with the work practice specified in § 60.34f(e) in lieu of the compliance provisions in § 60.36f.
            
            
              § 60.37f
              Monitoring of operations.
              For approval, a state plan must include the monitoring provisions in this section, except as provided in § 60.38f(d)(2).

              (i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the control device at least every 15 minutes; and
              (ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
              (d) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 60.33f(c) using a device other than a non-enclosed flare or an enclosed combustor or a treatment system must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in § 60.38f(d)(2) describing the operation of the control device, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator must review the information and either approve it, or request that additional information be submitted. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.

              (e) Each owner or operator seeking to install a collection system that does not meet the specifications in § 60.40f or seeking to monitor alternative parameters to those required by §§ 60.34f through 60.37f must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in § 60.38f(d)(2) and (3) describing the design and operation of the collection system, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.
              (f) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with the 500 parts per million surface methane operational standard in § 60.34f(d) must monitor surface concentrations of methane according to the procedures provided in § 60.36f(c) and the instrument specifications in § 60.36f(d). Any closed landfill that has no monitored exceedances of the operational standard in three consecutive quarterly monitoring periods may skip to annual monitoring. Any methane reading of 500 parts per million or more above background detected during the annual monitoring returns the frequency for that landfill to quarterly monitoring.
              (g) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with the control system requirements in § 60.33f(c) using a landfill gas treatment system must maintain and operate all monitoring systems associated with the treatment system in accordance with the site-specific treatment system monitoring plan required in § 60.39f(b)(5)(ii) and must calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a device that records flow to the treatment system and bypass of the treatment system (if applicable). The owner or operator must:
              (1) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the treatment system at least every 15 minutes; and
              (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
              (h) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (b), (c) (d) and (g) of this section apply at all times the affected source is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
            
            
              § 60.38f
              Reporting guidelines.
              For approval, a state plan must include the reporting provisions listed in this section, as applicable, except as provided under §§ 60.24 and 60.38f(d)(2).
              (a) Design capacity report. For existing MSW landfills subject to this subpart, the initial design capacity report must be submitted no later than 90 days after the effective date of EPA approval of the state's plan under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The initial design capacity report must contain the following information:
              (1) A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size and location of the landfill, and identifying all areas where solid waste may be landfilled according to the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill.

              (2) The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where the maximum design capacity is specified in the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, a copy of the permit specifying the maximum design capacity may be submitted as part of the report. If the maximum design capacity of the landfill is not specified in the permit, the maximum design capacity must be calculated using good engineering practices. The calculations must be provided, along with the relevant parameters as part of the report. The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually. Any density conversions must be documented and submitted with the design capacity report. The state, local, or tribal agency or the Administrator may request other reasonable information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design capacity of the landfill.
              (b) Amended design capacity report. An amended design capacity report must be submitted providing notification of an increase in the design capacity of the landfill, within 90 days of an increase in the maximum design capacity of the landfill to meet or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. This increase in design capacity may result from an increase in the permitted volume of the landfill or an increase in the density as documented in the annual recalculation required in § 60.39f(f).
              (c) NMOC emission rate report. For existing MSW landfills covered by this subpart with a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, the NMOC emission rate report must be submitted following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section no later than 90 days after the effective date of EPA approval of the state's plan under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The NMOC emission rate report must be submitted to the Administrator annually following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported NMOC emission rate.
              (1) The NMOC emission rate report must contain an annual or 5-year estimate of the NMOC emission rate calculated using the formula and procedures provided in § 60.35f(a) or (b), as applicable.
              (2) The NMOC emission rate report must include all the data, calculations, sample reports and measurements used to estimate the annual or 5-year emissions.
              (3) If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual report to the Administrator is less than 34 megagrams per year in each of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to submit, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period in lieu of the annual report. This estimate must include the current amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated waste acceptance rate for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based must be provided to the Administrator. This estimate must be revised at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year estimate, a revised 5-year estimate must be submitted to the Administrator. The revised estimate must cover the 5-year period beginning with the year in which the actual waste acceptance rate exceeded the estimated waste acceptance rate.
              (4) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart is exempted from the requirements to submit an NMOC emission rate report, after installing a collection and control system that complies with § 60.33f(b) and (c), during such time as the collection and control system is in operation and in compliance with §§ 60.34f and 60.36f.
              (d) Collection and control system design plan. The state plan must include a process for state review and approval of the site-specific design plan for each gas collection and control system. The collection and control system design plan must be prepared and approved by a professional engineer and must meet the following requirements:

              (1) The collection and control system as described in the design plan must meet the design requirements in § 60.33f(b) and (c).
              
              (2) The collection and control system design plan must include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting provisions of §§ 60.34f through 60.39f proposed by the owner or operator.
              (3) The collection and control system design plan must either conform to specifications for active collection systems in § 60.40f or include a demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction of the sufficiency of the alternative provisions to § 60.40f.
              (4) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters must submit a copy of the collection and control system design plan cover page that contains the engineer's seal to the Administrator within 1 year of the first NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year, except as follows:
              (i) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in § 60.35f(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year or the landfill is closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated NMOC emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, must be submitted, following the procedures in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 34 megagrams per year.
              (ii) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant k, as provided in Tier 3 in § 60.35f(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be used in the NMOC emission rate calculation until such time as the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of § 60.35f(a)(4) and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, to the Administrator within 1 year of the first calculated NMOC emission rate equaling or exceeding 34 megagrams per year.
              (iii) If the owner or operator elects to demonstrate that site-specific surface methane emissions are below 500 parts per million methane, based on the provisions of § 60.35f(a)(6), then the owner or operator must submit annually a Tier 4 surface emissions report as specified in this paragraph (d)(4)(iii) following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section until a surface emissions readings of 500 parts per million methane or greater is found. If the Tier 4 surface emissions report shows no surface emissions readings of 500 parts per million methane or greater for four consecutive quarters at a closed landfill, then the landfill owner or operator may reduce Tier 4 monitoring from a quarterly to an annual frequency. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported instantaneous surface emission readings. The Tier 4 surface emissions report must clearly identify the location, date and time (to the nearest second), average wind speeds including wind gusts, and reading (in parts per million) of any value 500 parts per million methane or greater, other than non-repeatable, momentary readings. For location, you must determine the latitude and longitude coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places. The Tier 4 surface emission report should also include the results of the most recent Tier 1 and Tier 2 results in order to verify that the landfill does not exceed 50 Mg/yr of NMOC.

              (A) The initial Tier 4 surface emissions report must be submitted annually, starting within 30 days of completing the fourth quarter of Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring that demonstrates that site-specific surface methane emissions are below 500 parts per million methane, and following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
              (B) The Tier 4 surface emissions rate report must be submitted within 1 year of the first measured surface exceedance of 500 parts per million methane, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
              (iv) If the landfill is in the closed landfill subcategory, the owner or operator must submit a collection and control system design plan to the Administrator within 1 year of the first NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams per year, except as follows:
              (A) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in § 60.35f(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year or the landfill is closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated NMOC emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 50 megagrams per year.
              (B) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant k, as provided in Tier 3 in § 60.35f(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be used in the NMOC emission rate calculation until such time as the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of § 60.35f(a)(4) and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, to the Administrator within 1 year of the first calculated NMOC emission rate equaling or exceeding 50 megagrams per year.
              (C) The landfill owner or operator elects to demonstrate surface emissions are low, consistent with the provisions in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.
              (D) The landfill has already submitted a gas collection and control system design plan consistent with the provisions of subpart WWW of this part; 40 CFR part 62, subpart GGG; or a state plan implementing subpart Cc of this part.
              (5) The landfill owner or operator must notify the Administrator that the design plan is completed and submit a copy of the plan's signature page. The Administrator has 90 days to decide whether the design plan should be submitted for review. If the Administrator chooses to review the plan, the approval process continues as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. However, if the Administrator indicates that submission is not required or does not respond within 90 days, the landfill owner or operator can continue to implement the plan with the recognition that the owner or operator is proceeding at their own risk. In the event that the design plan is required to be modified to obtain approval, the owner or operator must take any steps necessary to conform any prior actions to the approved design plan and any failure to do so could result in an enforcement action.

              (6) Upon receipt of an initial or revised design plan, the Administrator must review the information submitted under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section and either approve it, disapprove it, or request that additional information be submitted. Because of the many site-specific factors involved with landfill gas system design, alternative systems may be necessary. A wide variety of system designs are possible, such as vertical wells, combination horizontal and vertical collection systems, or horizontal trenches only, leachate collection components, and passive systems. If the Administrator does not approve or disapprove the design plan, or does not request that additional information be submitted within 90 days of receipt, then the owner or operator may continue with implementation of the design plan, recognizing they would be proceeding at their own risk.
              (7) If the owner or operator chooses to demonstrate compliance with the emission control requirements of this subpart using a treatment system as defined in this subpart, then the owner or operator must prepare a site-specific treatment system monitoring plan as specified in § 60.39f(b)(5).
              (e) Revised design plan. The owner or operator who has already been required to submit a design plan under paragraph (d) of this section, or under subpart WWW of this part; 40 CFR part 62, subpart GGG; or a state plan implementing subpart Cc of this part, must submit a revised design plan to the Administrator for approval as follows:
              (1) At least 90 days before expanding operations to an area not covered by the previously approved design plan.
              (2) Prior to installing or expanding the gas collection system in a way that is not consistent with the design plan that was submitted to the Administrator according to paragraph (d) of this section.
              (f) Closure report. Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must submit a closure report to the Administrator within 30 days of ceasing waste acceptance. The Administrator may request additional information as may be necessary to verify that permanent closure has taken place in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 258.60. If a closure report has been submitted to the Administrator, no additional wastes may be placed into the landfill without filing a notification of modification as described under § 60.7(a)(4).
              (g) Equipment removal report. Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must submit an equipment removal report to the Administrator 30 days prior to removal or cessation of operation of the control equipment.
              (1) The equipment removal report must contain the following items:
              (i) A copy of the closure report submitted in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section; and
              (ii) A copy of the initial performance test report demonstrating that the 15-year minimum control period has expired, unless the report of the results of the performance test has been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX, or information that demonstrates that the GCCS will be unable to operate for 15 years due to declining gas flows. In the equipment removal report, the process unit(s) tested, the pollutant(s) tested, and the date that such performance test was conducted may be submitted in lieu of the performance test report if the report has been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX; and
              (iii) Dated copies of three successive NMOC emission rate reports demonstrating that the landfill is no longer producing 34 megagrams or greater of NMOC per year, unless the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX. If the NMOC emission rate reports have been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX, a statement that the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted electronically and the dates that the reports were submitted to the EPA's CDX may be submitted in the equipment removal report in lieu of the NMOC emission rate reports; or
              (iv) For the closed landfill subcategory, dated copies of three successive NMOC emission rate reports demonstrating that the landfill is no longer producing 50 megagrams or greater of NMOC per year, unless the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX. If the NMOC emission rate reports have been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX, a statement that the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted electronically and the dates that the reports were submitted to the EPA's CDX may be submitted in the equipment removal report in lieu of the NMOC emission rate reports.
              (2) The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify that all of the conditions for removal in § 60.33f(f) have been met.
              (h) Annual report. The owner or operator of a landfill seeking to comply with § 60.33f(e)(2) using an active collection system designed in accordance with § 60.33f(b) must submit to the Administrator, following the procedures specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, an annual report of the recorded information in paragraphs (h)(1) through (7) of this section. The initial annual report must be submitted within 180 days of installation and startup of the collection and control system. The initial annual report must include the initial performance test report required under § 60.8, as applicable, unless the report of the results of the performance test has been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX. In the initial annual report, the process unit(s) tested, the pollutant(s) tested and the date that such performance test was conducted may be submitted in lieu of the performance test report if the report has been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX. The initial performance test report must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, no later than the date that the initial annual report is submitted. For enclosed combustion devices and flares, reportable exceedances are defined under § 60.39f(c)(1).

              § 60.40f
              Specifications for active collection systems.
              For approval, a state plan must include the specifications for active collection systems in this section.
              (a) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.33f(b) must site active collection wells, horizontal collectors, surface collectors, or other extraction devices at a sufficient density throughout all gas producing areas using the following procedures unless alternative procedures have been approved by the Administrator.
              (1) The collection devices within the interior must be certified to achieve comprehensive control of surface gas emissions by a professional engineer. The following issues must be addressed in the design: depths of refuse, refuse gas generation rates and flow characteristics, cover properties, gas system expandability, leachate and condensate management, accessibility, compatibility with filling operations, integration with closure end use, air intrusion control, corrosion resistance, fill settlement, resistance to the refuse decomposition heat, and ability to isolate individual components or sections for repair or troubleshooting without shutting down entire collection system.
              (2) The sufficient density of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must address landfill gas migration issues and augmentation of the collection system through the use of active or passive systems at the landfill perimeter or exterior.
              (3) The placement of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must control all gas producing areas, except as provided by paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) Any segregated area of asbestos or nondegradable material may be excluded from collection if documented as provided under § 60.39f(d). The documentation must provide the nature, date of deposition, location and amount of asbestos or nondegradable material deposited in the area, and must be provided to the Administrator upon request.
              (ii) Any nonproductive area of the landfill may be excluded from control, provided that the total of all excluded areas can be shown to contribute less than 1 percent of the total amount of NMOC emissions from the landfill. The amount, location, and age of the material must be documented and provided to the Administrator upon request. A separate NMOC emissions estimate must be made for each section proposed for exclusion, and the sum of all such sections must be compared to the NMOC emissions estimate for the entire landfill.
              (A) The NMOC emissions from each section proposed for exclusion must be computed using Equation 7:
              
                ER29AU16.006
              
              
                Where:
                
                Qi = NMOC emission rate from the ith section, megagrams per year.
                k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
                Lo = Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
                Mi = Mass of the degradable solid waste in the ith section, megagram.
                ti = Age of the solid waste in the ith section, years.
                CNMOC = Concentration of NMOC, parts per million by volume.
                3.6×10−9 = Conversion factor.
              
              

              (B) If the owner or operator is proposing to exclude, or cease gas collection and control from, nonproductive physically separated (e.g., separately lined) closed areas that already have gas collection systems, NMOC emissions from each physically separated closed area must be computed using either Equation 3 in § 60.35f or Equation 7 in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
              
              (iii) The values for k and CNMOC determined in field testing must be used if field testing has been performed in determining the NMOC emission rate or the radii of influence (the distance from the well center to a point in the landfill where the pressure gradient applied by the blower or compressor approaches zero). If field testing has not been performed, the default values for k, Lo, and CNMOC provided in § 60.35f or the alternative values from § 60.35f must be used. The mass of nondegradable solid waste contained within the given section may be subtracted from the total mass of the section when estimating emissions provided the nature, location, age, and amount of the nondegradable material is documented as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
              (b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.33f(b) must construct the gas collection devices using the following equipment or procedures:
              (1) The landfill gas extraction components must be constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous corrosion resistant material of suitable dimensions to: Convey projected amounts of gases; withstand installation, static, and settlement forces; and withstand planned overburden or traffic loads. The collection system must extend as necessary to comply with emission and migration standards. Collection devices such as wells and horizontal collectors must be perforated to allow gas entry without head loss sufficient to impair performance across the intended extent of control. Perforations must be situated with regard to the need to prevent excessive air infiltration.
              (2) Vertical wells must be placed so as not to endanger underlying liners and must address the occurrence of water within the landfill. Holes and trenches constructed for piped wells and horizontal collectors must be of sufficient cross-section so as to allow for their proper construction and completion including, for example, centering of pipes and placement of gravel backfill. Collection devices must be designed so as not to allow indirect short circuiting of air into the cover or refuse into the collection system or gas into the air. Any gravel used around pipe perforations should be of a dimension so as not to penetrate or block perforations.
              (3) Collection devices may be connected to the collection header pipes below or above the landfill surface. The connector assembly must include a positive closing throttle valve, any necessary seals and couplings, access couplings and at least one sampling port. The collection devices must be constructed of PVC, HDPE, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous material of suitable thickness.
              (c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.33f(c) must convey the landfill gas to a control system in compliance with § 60.33f(c) through the collection header pipe(s). The gas mover equipment must be sized to handle the maximum gas generation flow rate expected over the intended use period of the gas moving equipment using the following procedures:
              (1) For existing collection systems, the flow data must be used to project the maximum flow rate. If no flow data exist, the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be used.
              (2) For new collection systems, the maximum flow rate must be in accordance with § 60.36f(a)(1).

              § 60.45
              Emissions and fuel monitoring.

              (a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the applicable emissions standard shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) for measuring opacity and a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for measuring SO2 emissions, NOX emissions, and either oxygen (O2) or carbon dioxide (CO2) except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Certain of the CEMS and COMS requirements under paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to owners or operators under the following conditions:

              (1) For a fossil-fuel-fired steam generator that combusts only gaseous or liquid fossil fuel (excluding residual oil) with potential SO2 emissions rates of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less and that does not use post-combustion technology to reduce emissions of SO2 or PM, COMS for measuring the opacity of emissions and CEMS for measuring SO2 emissions are not required if the owner or operator monitors SO2 emissions by fuel sampling and analysis or fuel receipts.

              (2) For a fossil-fuel-fired steam generator that does not use a flue gas desulfurization device, a CEMS for measuring SO2 emissions is not required if the owner or operator monitors SO2 emissions by fuel sampling and analysis.

              (3) Notwithstanding § 60.13(b), installation of a CEMS for NOX may be delayed until after the initial performance tests under § 60.8 have been conducted. If the owner or operator demonstrates during the performance test that emissions of NOX are less than 70 percent of the applicable standards in § 60.44, a CEMS for measuring NOX emissions is not required. If the initial performance test results show that NOX emissions are greater than 70 percent of the applicable standard, the owner or operator shall install a CEMS for NOX within one year after the date of the initial performance tests under § 60.8 and comply with all other applicable monitoring requirements under this part.

              (4) If an owner or operator is not required to and elects not to install any CEMS for either SO2 or NOX, a CEMS for measuring either O2 or CO2 is not required.
              (5) For affected facilities using a PM CEMS, a bag leak detection system to monitor the performance of a fabric filter (baghouse) according to the most current requirements in § 60.48Da of this part, or an ESP predictive model to monitor the performance of the ESP developed in accordance and operated according to the most current requirements in section § 60.48Da of this part a COMS is not required.

              (6) A COMS for measuring the opacity of emissions is not required for an affected facility that does not use post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) for reducing PM, SO2, or carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, burns only gaseous fuels or fuel oils that contain less than or equal to 0.30 weight percent sulfur, and is operated such that emissions of CO to the atmosphere from the affected source are maintained at levels less than or equal to 0.15 lb/MMBtu on a boiler operating day average basis. Owners and operators of affected sources electing to comply with this paragraph must demonstrate compliance according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section.

              (i) You must monitor CO emissions using a CEMS according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.
              
              (A) The CO CEMS must be installed, certified, maintained, and operated according to the provisions in § 60.58b(i)(3) of subpart Eb of this part.
              (B) Each 1-hour CO emissions average is calculated using the data points generated by the CO CEMS expressed in parts per million by volume corrected to 3 percent oxygen (dry basis).
              (C) At a minimum, valid 1-hour CO emissions averages must be obtained for at least 90 percent of the operating hours on a 30-day rolling average basis. The 1-hour averages are calculated using the data points required in § 60.13(h)(2).
              (D) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests for the CO CEMS must be performed in accordance with procedure 1 in appendix F of this part.
              (ii) You must calculate the 1-hour average CO emissions levels for each boiler operating day by multiplying the average hourly CO output concentration measured by the CO CEMS times the corresponding average hourly flue gas flow rate and divided by the corresponding average hourly heat input to the affected source. The 24-hour average CO emission level is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of the hourly CO emission levels computed for each boiler operating day.
              (iii) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average CO emission level each boiler operating day excluding periods of affected source startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the 24-hour average CO emission level is greater than 0.15 lb/MMBtu, you must initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high emission incident and, take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or repair equipment to reduce the 24-hour average CO emission level to 0.15 lb/MMBtu or less.
              (iv) You must record the CO measurements and calculations performed according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section and any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and time during which the 24-hour average CO emission level was greater than 0.15 lb/MMBtu, and the date, time, and description of the corrective action.
              (7) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard under § 60.42 that elects to not use a COMS because the affected facility burns only fuels as specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, monitors PM emissions as specified under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, or monitors CO emissions as specified under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, shall conduct a performance test using Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limit in § 60.42 by April 29, 2011 or within 45 days after stopping use of an existing COMS, whichever is later, and shall comply with either paragraph (b)(7)(i), (b)(7)(ii), or (b)(7)(iii) of this section. The observation period for Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests may be reduced from 3 hours to 60 minutes if all 6-minute averages are less than 10 percent and all individual 15-second observations are less than or equal to 20 percent during the initial 60 minutes of observation. The permitting authority may exempt owners or operators of affected facilities burning only natural gas from the opacity monitoring requirements.
              (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) or (b)(7)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests using the procedures in paragraph (b)(7) of this section according to the applicable schedule in paragraphs (b)(7)(i)(A) through (b)(7)(i)(D) of this section, as determined by the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test results.
              (A) If no visible emissions are observed, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 12 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later;

              (B) If visible emissions are observed but the maximum 6-minute average opacity is less than or equal to 5 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 6 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later;
              (C) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 5 percent but less than or equal to 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 3 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later; or
              (D) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 45 calendar days from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted.
              (ii) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.

              (A) The owner or operator shall conduct 10 minute observations (during normal operation) each operating day the affected facility fires fuel for which an opacity standard is applicable using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part and demonstrate that the sum of the occurrences of any visible emissions is not in excess of 5 percent of the observation period (i.e., 30 seconds per 10 minute period). If the sum of the occurrence of any visible emissions is greater than 30 seconds during the initial 10 minute observation, immediately conduct a 30 minute observation. If the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is greater than 5 percent of the observation period (i.e., 90 seconds per 30 minute period), the owner or operator shall either document and adjust the operation of the facility and demonstrate within 24 hours that the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is equal to or less than 5 percent during a 30 minute observation (i.e., 90 seconds) or conduct a new Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test using the procedures in paragraph (b)(7) of this section within 45 calendar days according to the requirements in § 60.46(b)(3).
              (B) If no visible emissions are observed for 10 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable, observations can be reduced to once every 7 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable. If any visible emissions are observed, daily observations shall be resumed.
              (iii) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 performance tests, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using a digital opacity compliance system according to a site-specific monitoring plan approved by the Administrator. The observations shall be similar, but not necessarily identical, to the requirements in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section. For reference purposes in preparing the monitoring plan, see OAQPS “Determination of Visible Emission Opacity from Stationary Sources Using Computer-Based Photographic Analysis Systems.” This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality and Planning Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

The O2 sample shall be obtained simultaneously with, and at the same traverse points as, the particulate sample. If the grab sampling procedure is used, the O2 concentration for the run shall be the arithmetic mean of the sample O2 concentrations at all traverse points.

              (iii) If the particulate run has more than 12 traverse points, the O2 traverse points may be reduced to 12 provided that Method 1 of appendix A of this part is used to locate the 12 O2 traverse points.

The method used to determine the calorific value of wood residue must be approved by the Administrator.
              (3) Suitable methods shall be used to determine the rate of each fuel burned during each test period, and a material balance over the steam generating system shall be used to confirm the rate.

              (i) The emission rate (E) shall be computed using the following equation:
              
              
                ER13JN07.007
              
              
                Where:

Then if Fo (average of three runs), as calculated from the equation in Method 3B of appendix A of this part, is more than ±3 percent than the average Fo value, as determined from the average values of Fd and Fc in Method 19 of appendix A of this part, i.e., Foa = 0.209 (Fda/Fca), then the following procedure shall be followed:
              (A) When Fo is less than 0.97 Foa, then E shall be increased by that proportion under 0.97 Foa, e.g., if Fo is 0.95 Foa, E shall be increased by 2 percent. This recalculated value shall be used to determine compliance with the emission standard.
              (B) When Fo is less than 0.97 Foa and when the average difference (d) between the continuous monitor minus the reference methods is negative, then E shall be increased by that proportion under 0.97 Foa, e.g., if Fo is 0.95 Foa, E shall be increased by 2 percent. This recalculated value shall be used to determine compliance with the relative accuracy specification.
              (C) When Fo is greater than 1.03 Foa and when the average difference d is positive, then E shall be decreased by that proportion over 1.03 Foa, e.g., if Fo is 1.05 Foa, E shall be decreased by 2 percent. This recalculated value shall be used to determine compliance with the relative accuracy specification.

              (2) For Method 5 or 5B of appendix A-3 of this part, Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part may be used at facilities with or without wet FGD systems if the stack gas temperature at the sampling location does not exceed an average temperature of 160 °C (320 °F). The procedures of sections 8.1 and 11.1 of Method 5B of appendix A-3 of this part may be used with Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part only if it is used after wet FGD systems. Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall not be used after wet FGD systems if the effluent gas is saturated or laden with water droplets.

              (i) The filter and impinger apparatus in sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 of Method 8 of appendix A of this part is used in place of the condenser (section 2.1.7) of Method 5 of appendix A of this part.

              (ii) All applicable procedures in Method 8 of appendix A of this part for the determination of SO2 (including moisture) are used:

              (4) For Method 6 of appendix A of this part, Method 6C of appendix A of this part may be used. Method 6A of appendix A of this part may also be used whenever Methods 6 and 3B of appendix A of this part data are specified to determine the SO2 emission rate, under the conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

              (5) For Method 7 of appendix A of this part, Method 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E of appendix A of this part may be used. If Method 7C, 7D, or 7E of appendix A of this part is used, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 1 hour and the integrated sampling approach shall be used to determine the O2 concentration (%O2) for the emission rate correction factor.
              (6) For Method 3 of appendix A of this part, Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part may be used.
              (7) For Method 3B of appendix A of this part, Method 3A of appendix A of this part may be used.

                Steam generating unit for facilities constructed, reconstructed, or modified before May 4, 2011, means any furnace, boiler, or other device used for combusting fuel for the purpose of producing steam (including fossil-fuel-fired steam generators associated with combined cycle gas turbines; nuclear steam generators are not included). For units constructed, reconstructed, or modified after May 3, 2011, steam generating unit means any furnace, boiler, or other device used for combusting fuel for the purpose of producing steam (including fossil-fuel-fired steam generators associated with combined cycle gas turbines; nuclear steam generators are not included) plus any integrated combustion turbines and fuel cells.
              
                Subbituminous coal means coal that is classified as subbituminous A, B, or C according to the American Society of Testing and Materials in ASTM D388 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17).
              
                Wet flue gas desulfurization technology or wet FGD means a SO2 control system that is located downstream of the steam generating unit and removes sulfur oxides from the combustion gases of the steam generating unit by contacting the combustion gases with an alkaline slurry or solution and forming a liquid material. This definition applies to devices where the aqueous liquid material product of this contact is subsequently converted to other forms. Alkaline reagents used in wet FGD technology include, but are not limited to, lime, limestone, and sodium.

              § 60.48Da
              Compliance provisions.

              (a) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced before May 4, 2011, the applicable PM emissions limit and opacity standard under § 60.42Da, SO2 emissions limit under § 60.43Da, and NOX emissions limit under § 60.44Da apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011, the applicable SO2 emissions limit under § 60.43Da, NOX emissions limit under § 60.44Da, and NOX plus CO emissions limit under § 60.45Da apply at all times. The applicable PM emissions limit and opacity standard under § 60.42Da apply at all times except during periods of startup and shutdown.

              (b) After the initial performance test required under § 60.8, compliance with the applicable SO2 emissions limit and percentage reduction requirements under § 60.43Da, NOX emissions limit under § 60.44Da, and NOX plus CO emissions limit under § 60.45Da is based on the average emission rate for 30 successive boiler operating days. A separate performance test is completed at the end of each boiler operating day after the initial performance test, and a new 30-boiler operating day rolling average emission rate for both SO2, NOX or NOX plus CO as applicable, and a new percent reduction for SO2 are calculated to demonstrate compliance with the standards.

              (c) For the initial performance test required under § 60.8, compliance with the applicable SO2 emissions limits and percentage reduction requirements under § 60.43Da, the NOX emissions limits under § 60.44Da, and the NOX plus CO emissions limits under § 60.45Da is based on the average emission rates for SO2, NOX, CO, and percent reduction for SO2 for the first 30 successive boiler operating days. The initial performance test is the only test in which at least 30 days prior notice is required unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The initial performance test is to be scheduled so that the first boiler operating day of the 30 successive boiler operating days is completed within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial startup of the facility.

              (d) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced before May 4, 2011, compliance with applicable 30-boiler operating day rolling average SO2 and NOX emissions limits is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of all hourly emission rates for SO2 and NOX for the 30 successive boiler operating days, except for data obtained during startup, shutdown, or malfunction. For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011, compliance with applicable 30-boiler operating day rolling average SO2 and NOX emissions limits is determined by dividing the sum of the SO2 and NOX emissions for the 30 successive boiler operating days by the sum of the gross energy output or net energy output, as applicable, for the 30 successive boiler operating days.

              (e) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced before May 4, 2011, compliance with applicable SO2 percentage reduction requirements is determined based on the average inlet and outlet SO2 emission rates for the 30 successive boiler operating days. For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011, compliance with applicable SO2 percentage reduction requirements is determined based on the “as fired” total potential emissions and the total outlet SO2 emissions for the 30 successive boiler operating days.

              (f) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced before May 4, 2011, compliance with the applicable daily average PM emissions limit is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of all hourly emission rates each boiler operating day, except for data obtained during startup, shutdown, or malfunction periods. Daily averages are only calculated for boiler operating days that have non-out-of-control data for at least 18 hours of unit operation during which the standard applies. Instead, all of the non-out-of-control hourly emission rates of the operating day(s) not meeting the minimum 18 hours non-out-of-control data daily average requirement are averaged with all of the non-out-of-control hourly emission rates of the next boiler operating day with 18 hours or more of non-out-of-control PM CEMS data to determine compliance. For affected facilities for which construction or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011 that elect to demonstrate compliance using PM CEMS, compliance with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da is determined on a 30-boiler operating day rolling average basis by calculating the arithmetic average of all hourly PM emission rates for the 30 successive boiler operating days, except for data obtained during periods of startup and shutdown.

              (g) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011, compliance with applicable 30-boiler operating day rolling average NOX plus CO emissions limit is determined by dividing the sum of the NOX plus CO emissions for the 30 successive boiler operating days by the sum of the gross energy output or net energy output, as applicable, for the 30 successive boiler operating days.
              (h) If an owner or operator has not obtained the minimum quantity of emission data as required under § 60.49Da of this subpart, compliance of the affected facility with the emission requirements under §§ 60.43Da and 60.44Da of this subpart for the day on which the 30-day period ends may be determined by the Administrator by following the applicable procedures in section 7 of Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
              (i) Compliance provisions for sources subject to § 60.44Da(d)(1), (e)(1), (e)(2)(i), (e)(3)(i), (f), or (g). The owner or operator shall calculate NOX emissions as 1.194 × 10−7 lb/scf-ppm times the average hourly NOX output concentration in ppm (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(c)), times the average hourly flow rate (measured in scfh, according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(l) or § 60.49Da(m)), divided by the average hourly gross energy output (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(k)) or the average hourly net energy output, as applicable. Alternatively, for oil-fired and gas-fired units, NOX emissions may be calculated by multiplying the hourly NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu (measured by the CEMS required under § 60.49Da(c) and (d)), by the hourly heat input rate (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(n)), and dividing the result by the average gross energy output (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(k)) or the average hourly net energy output, as applicable.
              (j) Compliance provisions for duct burners subject to § 60.44Da(a)(1). To determine compliance with the emissions limits for NOX required by § 60.44Da(a) for duct burners used in combined cycle systems, either of the procedures described in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section may be used:
              (1) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner shall conduct the performance test required under § 60.8 using the appropriate methods in appendix A of this part. Compliance with the emissions limits under § 60.44Da(a)(1) is determined on the average of three (nominal 1-hour) runs for the initial and subsequent performance tests. During the performance test, one sampling site shall be located in the exhaust of the turbine prior to the duct burner. A second sampling site shall be located at the outlet from the heat recovery steam generating unit. Measurements shall be taken at both sampling sites during the performance test; or

              (2) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner may elect to determine compliance by using the CEMS specified under § 60.49Da for measuring NOX and oxygen (O2) (or carbon dioxide (CO2)) and meet the requirements of § 60.49Da. Alternatively, data from a NOX emission rate (i.e., NOX-diluent) CEMS certified according to the provisions of § 75.20(c) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, and meeting the quality assurance requirements of § 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, may be used, with the following caveats. Data used to meet the requirements of § 60.51Da shall not include substitute data values derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter. The sampling site shall be located at the outlet from the steam generating unit. The NOX emission rate at the outlet from the steam generating unit shall constitute the NOX emission rate from the duct burner of the combined cycle system.
              (k) Compliance provisions for duct burners subject to § 60.44Da(d)(1) or (e)(1). To determine compliance with the emission limitation for NOX required by § 60.44Da(d)(1) or (e)(1) for duct burners used in combined cycle systems, either of the procedures described in paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section may be used:

                ER16FE12.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = Emission rate of NOX from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/MWh) gross energy output;

                Qte = Average hourly volumetric flow rate of exhaust gas from combustion turbine, dscm/h (dscf/h);
                Osg = Average hourly gross energy output from steam generating unit, J/h (MW); and
                h = Average hourly fraction of the total heat input to the steam generating unit derived from the combustion of fuel in the affected duct burner.
              
              

              (ii) Method 7E of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine the NOX concentrations (Csg and Cte). Method 2, 2F or 2G of appendix A of this part, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rates (Qsg and Qte) of the exhaust gases. The volumetric flow rate measurements shall be taken at the same time as the concentration measurements.
              (iii) The owner or operator shall develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator to determine the average hourly gross energy output from the steam generating unit, and the average hourly percentage of the total heat input to the steam generating unit derived from the combustion of fuel in the affected duct burner.
              (iv) Compliance with the applicable NOX emission limitation in § 60.44Da(d)(1) or (e)(1) is determined by the three-run average (nominal 1-hour runs) for the initial and subsequent performance tests.

              (2) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner used in a combined cycle system may elect to determine compliance with the applicable NOX emission limitation in § 60.44Da(d)(1) or (e)(1) on a 30-day rolling average basis as indicated in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) The emission rate (E) of NOX shall be computed using Equation 3 in this section:
              
                ER16FE12.001
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = Emission rate of NOX from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/MWh) gross energy output;
                Csg = Average hourly concentration of NOX exiting the steam generating unit, ng/dscm (lb/dscf);
                Qsg = Average hourly volumetric flow rate of exhaust gas from steam generating unit, dscm/h (dscf/h); and
                Occ = Average hourly gross energy output from entire combined cycle unit, J/h (MW).
              
              

              (ii) The CEMS specified under § 60.49Da for measuring NOX and O2 (or CO2) shall be used to determine the average hourly NOX concentrations (Csg). The continuous flow monitoring system specified in § 60.49Da(l) or § 60.49Da(m) shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate (Qsg) of the exhaust gas. If the option to use the flow monitoring system in § 60.49Da(m) is selected, the flow rate data used to meet the requirements of § 60.51Da shall not include substitute data values derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter. The sampling site shall be located at the outlet from the steam generating unit.

              (iii) The continuous monitoring system specified under § 60.49Da(k) for measuring and determining gross energy output shall be used to determine the average hourly gross energy output from the entire combined cycle unit (Occ), which is the combined output from the combustion turbine and the steam generating unit.

              (iv) The owner or operator may, in lieu of installing, operating, and recording data from the continuous flow monitoring system specified in § 60.49Da(l), determine the mass rate (lb/h) of NOX emissions by installing, operating, and maintaining continuous fuel flowmeters following the appropriate measurements procedures specified in appendix D of part 75 of this chapter. If this compliance option is selected, the emission rate (E) of NOX shall be computed using Equation 4 in this section:
              
                ER16FE12.002
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = Emission rate of NOX from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/MWh) gross energy output;

              (3) When an affected duct burner steam generating unit utilizes a common steam turbine with one or more affected duct burner steam generating units, the owner or operator shall either:
              (i) Determine compliance with the applicable NOX emissions limits by measuring the emissions combined with the emissions from the other unit(s) utilizing the common steam turbine; or
              (ii) Develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on methods for apportioning the combined gross energy output from the steam turbine for each of the affected duct burners. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning the combined gross energy output measured at the steam turbine whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation of emissions regulated under this part.
              (l) [Reserved]

              (m) Compliance provisions for sources subject to § 60.43Da(i)(1)(i), (i)(2)(i), (i)(3)(i), (j)(1)(i), (j)(2)(i), (j)(3)(i), (l)(1)(i), (l)(1)(ii), or (l)(2). The owner or operator shall calculate SO2 emissions as 1.660 × 10−7 lb/scf-ppm times the average hourly SO2 output concentration in ppm (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(b)), times the average hourly flow rate (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(l) or § 60.49Da(m)), divided by the average hourly gross energy output (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(k)) or the average hourly net energy output, as applicable. Alternatively, for oil-fired and gas-fired units, SO2 emissions may be calculated by multiplying the hourly SO2 emission rate (in lb/MMBtu), measured by the CEMS required under § 60.49Da, by the hourly heat input rate (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(n)), and dividing the result by the average gross energy output (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(k)) or the average hourly net energy output, as applicable.
              (n) Compliance provisions for sources subject to § 60.42Da(c)(1) or (e)(1)(i). The owner or operator shall calculate PM emissions by multiplying the average hourly PM output concentration (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(t)), by the average hourly flow rate (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(l) or § 60.49Da(m)), and dividing by the average hourly gross energy output (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(k)) or the average hourly net energy output, as applicable.
              (o) Compliance provisions for sources subject to § 60.42Da(c)(2), (d), or (e)(1)(ii). Except as provided for in paragraph (p) of this section, the owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with each applicable emissions limit according to the requirements in paragraphs (o)(1) through (o)(5) of this section.
              (1) You must conduct a performance test to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da by the applicable date specified in § 60.8(a). Thereafter, you must conduct each subsequent performance test within 12 calendar months following the date the previous performance test was required to be conducted. You must conduct each performance test according to the requirements in § 60.8 using the test methods and procedures in § 60.50Da. The owner or operator of an affected facility that has not operated for 60 consecutive calendar days prior to the date that the subsequent performance test would have been required had the unit been operating is not required to perform the subsequent performance test until 30 calendar days after the next boiler operating day. Requests for additional 30 day extensions shall be granted by the relevant air division or office director of the appropriate Regional Office of the U.S. EPA.
              (2) You must monitor the performance of each electrostatic precipitator or fabric filter (baghouse) operated to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da using a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) according to the requirements in paragraphs (o)(2)(i) through (vi) unless you elect to comply with one of the alternatives provided in paragraphs (o)(3) and (o)(4) of this section, as applicable to your control device.
              (i) Each COMS must meet Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
              (ii) You must comply with the quality assurance requirements in paragraphs (o)(2)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section.
              (A) You must automatically (intrinsic to the opacity monitor) check the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least once daily. For a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and upscale calibration materials is as defined in the applicable version of Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
              (B) You must adjust the zero and span whenever the 24-hour zero drift or 24-hour span drift exceeds 4 percent opacity. The COMS must allow for the amount of excess zero and span drift measured at the 24-hour interval checks to be recorded and quantified. The optical surfaces exposed to the effluent gases must be cleaned prior to performing the zero and span drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic zero adjustments. For systems using automatic zero adjustments, the optical surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation exceeds 4 percent opacity.
              (C) You must apply a method for producing a simulated zero opacity condition and an upscale (span) opacity condition using a certified neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known obscuration of the light beam. All procedures applied must provide a system check of the analyzer internal optical surfaces and all electronic circuitry including the lamp and photodetector assembly.

              (D) Except during periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, the COMS must be in continuous operation and must complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10 second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.
              (E) You must reduce all data from the COMS to 6-minute averages. Six-minute opacity averages must be calculated from 36 or more data points equally spaced over each 6-minute period. Data recorded during periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments must not be included in the data averages. An arithmetic or integrated average of all data may be used.
              (iii) During each performance test conducted according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section, you must establish an opacity baseline level. The value of the opacity baseline level is determined by averaging all of the 6-minute average opacity values (reported to the nearest 0.1 percent opacity) from the COMS measurements recorded during each of the test run intervals conducted for the performance test, and then adding 2.5 percent opacity to your calculated average opacity value for all of the test runs. If your opacity baseline level is less than 5.0 percent, then the opacity baseline level is set at 5.0 percent.
              (iv) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average opacity level measured by the COMS each boiler operating day excluding periods of affected facility startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the measured 24-hour average opacity emission level is greater than the baseline opacity level determined in paragraph (o)(2)(iii) of this section, you must initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high opacity incident and take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or repair equipment to reduce the measured 24-hour average opacity to a level below the baseline opacity level. In cases when a wet scrubber is used in combination with another PM control device that serves as the primary PM control device, the wet scrubber must be maintained and operated.
              (v) You must record the opacity measurements, calculations performed, and any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and time during which the measured 24-hour average opacity was greater than baseline opacity level, and the date, time, and description of the corrective action.
              (vi) If the measured 24-hour average opacity for your affected facility remains at a level greater than the opacity baseline level after 7 boiler operating days, then you must conduct a new PM performance test according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section and establish a new opacity baseline value according to paragraph (o)(2) of this section. This new performance test must be conducted within 60 days of the date that the measured 24-hour average opacity was first determined to exceed the baseline opacity level unless a waiver is granted by the permitting authority.
              (3) As an alternative to complying with the requirements of paragraph (o)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to monitor the performance of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) operated to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da using an ESP predictive model developed in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.
              (i) You must calibrate the ESP predictive model with each PM control device used to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da operating under normal conditions. In cases when a wet scrubber is used in combination with an ESP to comply with the PM emissions limit, the wet scrubber must be maintained and operated.

              (ii) You must develop a site-specific monitoring plan that includes a description of the ESP predictive model used, the model input parameters, and the procedures and criteria for establishing monitoring parameter baseline levels indicative of compliance with the PM emissions limit. You must submit the site-specific monitoring plan for approval by the permitting authority. For reference purposes in preparing the monitoring plan, see the OAQPS “Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) Protocol for an Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) Controlling Particulate Matter (PM) Emissions from a Coal-Fired Boiler.” This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emission Measurement Center Continuous Emission Monitoring.
              (iii) You must run the ESP predictive model using the applicable input data each boiler operating day and evaluate the model output for the preceding boiler operating day excluding periods of affected facility startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the values for one or more of the model parameters exceed the applicable baseline levels determined according to your approved site-specific monitoring plan, you must initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first discovery of a model parameter deviation and, take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or repair equipment to return the model output to within the applicable baseline levels.
              (iv) You must record the ESP predictive model inputs and outputs and any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and time during which the model output values exceeded the applicable baseline levels, and the date, time, and description of the corrective action.
              (v) If after 7 consecutive days a model parameter continues to exceed the applicable baseline level, then you must conduct a new PM performance test according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section. This new performance test must be conducted within 60 calendar days of the date that the model parameter was first determined to exceed its baseline level unless a waiver is granted by the permitting authority.
              (4) As an alternative to complying with the requirements of paragraph (o)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to monitor the performance of a fabric filter (baghouse) operated to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da by using a bag leak detection system according to the requirements in paragraphs (o)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
              (i) Each bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements in paragraphs (o)(4)(i)(A) through (H) of this section.
              (A) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
              (B) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative PM loadings. The owner or operator must continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger.)
              (C) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will react when the system detects an increase in relative particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (o)(4)(i)(D) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be noticed by the appropriate plant personnel.
              (D) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm set points, and the alarm delay time.
              (E) Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the permitting authority except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section.
              (F) Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (o)(4)(ii) of this section.
              (G) You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the fabric filter and upstream of any wet scrubber.
              (H) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.

              (ii) You must develop and submit to the permitting authority for approval a site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. You must operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (o)(4)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section.
              (A) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
              (B) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;
              (C) Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality assurance procedures;
              (D) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;
              (E) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored; and
              (F) Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (o)(4)(iii) of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the permitting authority may allow owners and operators more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.
              (iii) For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except as provided in paragraph (o)(4)(ii)(F) of this section, you must alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:
              (A) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in particulate emissions;
              (B) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
              (C) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device;
              (D) Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment;
              (E) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system; or
              (F) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.
              (iv) You must maintain records of the information specified in paragraphs (o)(4)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section for each bag leak detection system.
              (A) Records of the bag leak detection system output;
              (B) Records of bag leak detection system adjustments, including the date and time of the adjustment, the initial bag leak detection system settings, and the final bag leak detection system settings; and
              (C) The date and time of all bag leak detection system alarms, the time that procedures to determine the cause of the alarm were initiated, if procedures were initiated within 1 hour of the alarm, the cause of the alarm, an explanation of the actions taken, the date and time the cause of the alarm was alleviated, and if the alarm was alleviated within 3 hours of the alarm.
              (v) If after any period composed of 30 boiler operating days during which the alarm rate exceeds 5 percent of the process operating time (excluding control device or process startup, shutdown, and malfunction), then you must conduct a new PM performance test according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section. This new performance test must be conducted within 60 calendar days of the date that the alarm rate was first determined to exceed 5 percent limit unless a waiver is granted by the permitting authority.

              (5) An owner or operator of a modified affected facility electing to meet the emission limitations in § 60.42Da(d) shall determine the percent reduction in PM by using the emission rate for PM determined by the performance test conducted according to the requirements in paragraph (o)(1) of this section and the ash content on a mass basis of the fuel burned during each performance test run as determined by analysis of the fuel as fired.
              
              (p) As an alternative to meeting the compliance provisions specified in paragraph (o) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to install, evaluate, maintain, and operate a CEMS measuring PM emissions discharged from the affected facility to the atmosphere and record the output of the system as specified in paragraphs (p)(1) through (p)(8) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator shall submit a written notification to the Administrator of intent to demonstrate compliance with this subpart by using a CEMS measuring PM. This notification shall be sent at least 30 calendar days before the initial startup of the monitor for compliance determination purposes. The owner or operator may discontinue operation of the monitor and instead return to demonstration of compliance with this subpart according to the requirements in paragraph (o) of this section by submitting written notification to the Administrator of such intent at least 30 calendar days before shutdown of the monitor for compliance determination purposes.
              (2) Each CEMS shall be installed, evaluated, operated, and maintained according to the requirements in § 60.49Da(v).
              (3) The initial performance evaluation shall be completed no later than 180 days after the date of initial startup of the affected facility, as specified under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part or within 180 days of the date of notification to the Administrator required under paragraph (p)(1) of this section, whichever is later.
              (4) Compliance with the applicable emissions limit shall be determined based on the 24-hour daily (block) average of the hourly arithmetic average emissions concentrations using the continuous monitoring system outlet data. The 24-hour block arithmetic average emission concentration shall be calculated using EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A of this part, section 4.1.
              (5) At a minimum, non-out-of-control CEMS hourly averages shall be obtained for 75 percent of all operating hours on a 30-boiler operating day rolling average basis. Beginning on January 1, 2012, non-out-of-control CEMS hourly averages shall be obtained for 90 percent of all operating hours on a 30-boiler operating day rolling average basis.
              (i) At least two data points per hour shall be used to calculate each 1-hour arithmetic average.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (6) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required shall be expressed in ng/J, MMBtu/hr, or lb/MWh and shall be used to calculate the boiler operating day daily arithmetic average emission concentrations. The 1-hour arithmetic averages shall be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of this part.
              (7) All non-out-of-control CEMS data shall be used in calculating average emission concentrations even if the minimum CEMS data requirements of paragraph (j)(5) of this section are not met.
              (8) When PM emissions data are not obtained because of CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, emissions data shall be obtained by using other monitoring systems as approved by the Administrator or EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A of this part to provide, as necessary, non-out-of-control emissions data for a minimum of 90 percent (only 75 percent is required prior to January 1, 2012) of all operating hours per 30-boiler operating day rolling average.
              (q) Compliance provisions for sources subject to § 60.42Da(b). An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the opacity standard in § 60.42Da(b) shall monitor the opacity of emissions discharged from the affected facility to the atmosphere according to the requirements in § 60.49Da(a), as applicable to the affected facility.

              (r) Compliance provisions for sources subject to § 60.45Da. To determine compliance with the NOX plus CO emissions limit, the owner or operator shall use the procedures specified in paragraphs (r)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) Calculate NOX emissions as 1.194 × 10−7 lb/scf-ppm times the average hourly NOX output concentration in ppm (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(c)), times the average hourly flow rate (measured in scfh, according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(l) or § 60.49Da(m)), divided by the average hourly gross energy output (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(k)) or the average hourly net energy output, as applicable.
              (2) Calculate CO emissions by multiplying the average hourly CO output concentration (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(u), by the average hourly flow rate (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(l) or § 60.49Da(m)), and dividing by the average hourly gross energy output (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(k)) or the average hourly net energy output, as applicable.
              (3) Calculate NOX plus CO emissions by summing the NOX emissions results from paragraph (r)(1) of this section plus the CO emissions results from paragraph (r)(2) of this section.
              (s) Affirmative defense for exceedance of emissions limit during malfunction. In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in paragraph §§ 60.42Da, 60.43Da, 60.44Da, and 60.45Da, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at 40 CFR 60.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense as specified in paragraphs (s)(1) and (2) of this section. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (s)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (i) The excess emissions:
              (A) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
              (B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better operation and maintenance practices; and
              (C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
              (D) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emissions limits were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
              (iii) The frequency, amount, and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and
              (iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
              (v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
              (vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
              (vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              (viii) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (2) Notification. The owner or operator of the affected source experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than two business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction or, if it is not possible to determine within two business days whether the malfunction caused or contributed to an exceedance, no later than two business days after the owner or operator knew or should have known that the malfunction caused or contributed to an exceedance, but, in no event later than two business days after the end of the averaging period, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in § 63.9991 to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (s)(1) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.
              [72 FR 32722, June 13, 2007, as amended at 74 FR 5079, Jan. 28, 2009; 76 FR 3522, Jan. 20, 2011; 77 FR 9454, Feb. 16, 2012; 78 FR 24083, Apr. 24, 2013; 81 FR 20180, Apr. 6, 2016]
            
            
              § 60.49Da
              Emission monitoring.
              (a) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the opacity standard in § 60.42Da must monitor the opacity of emissions discharged from the affected facility to the atmosphere according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.

              (1) Except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(2) and (4) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard, shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a COMS, and record the output of the system, for measuring the opacity of emissions discharged to the atmosphere. If opacity interference due to water droplets exists in the stack (for example, from the use of an FGD system), the opacity is monitored upstream of the interference (at the inlet to the FGD system). If opacity interference is experienced at all locations (both at the inlet and outlet of the SO2 control system), alternate parameters indicative of the PM control system's performance and/or good combustion are monitored (subject to the approval of the Administrator).
              (2) As an alternative to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an owner or operator of an affected facility that meets the conditions in either paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may elect to monitor opacity as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
              (i) The affected facility uses a fabric filter (baghouse) to meet the standards in § 60.42Da and a bag leak detection system is installed and operated according to the requirements in paragraphs § 60.48Da(o)(4)(i) through (v);

              (ii) The affected facility burns only gaseous or liquid fuels (excluding residual oil) with potential SO2 emissions rates of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less, and does not use a post-combustion technology to reduce emissions of SO2 or PM;
              (iii) The affected facility meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section.

              (A) No post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) is used for reducing PM, SO2, or CO emissions;
              (B) Only natural gas, gaseous fuels, or fuel oils that contain less than or equal to 0.30 weight percent sulfur are burned; and
              (C) Emissions of CO discharged to the atmosphere are maintained at levels less than or equal to 1.4 lb/MWh on a boiler operating day average basis as demonstrated by the use of a CEMS measuring CO emissions according to the procedures specified in paragraph (u) of this section; or
              (iv) The affected facility uses an ESP and uses an ESP predictive model to monitor the performance of the ESP developed in accordance and operated according to the most current requirements in section § 60.48Da of this part.

              (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility that meets the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may, as an alternative to using a COMS, elect to monitor visible emissions using the applicable procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section. The opacity performance test requirement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) must be conducted by April 29, 2011, within 45 days after stopping use of an existing COMS, or within 180 days after initial startup of the facility, whichever is later.
              (i) The owner or operator shall conduct a performance test using Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11. If during the initial 60 minutes of the observation all the 6-minute averages are less than 10 percent and all the individual 15-second observations are less than or equal to 20 percent, then the observation period may be reduced from 3 hours to 60 minutes.
              (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests using the procedures in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section according to the applicable schedule in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, as determined by the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test results.
              (A) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is less than or equal to 5 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 12 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later;
              (B) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 5 percent but less than or equal to 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 3 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later; or
              (C) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 45 calendar days from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted.
              (iii) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.

              (A) The owner or operator shall conduct 10 minute observations (during normal operation) each operating day the affected facility fires fuel for which an opacity standard is applicable using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part and demonstrate that the sum of the occurrences of any visible emissions is not in excess of 5 percent of the observation period (i.e., 30 seconds per 10 minute period). If the sum of the occurrence of any visible emissions is greater than 30 seconds during the initial 10 minute observation, immediately conduct a 30 minute observation. If the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is greater than 5 percent of the observation period (i.e., 90 seconds per 30 minute period), the owner or operator shall either document and adjust the operation of the facility and demonstrate within 24 hours that the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is equal to or less than 5 percent during a 30 minute observation (i.e., 90 seconds) or conduct a new Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test using the procedures in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section within 45 calendar days according to the requirements in § 60.50Da(b)(3).
              (B) If no visible emissions are observed for 10 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable, observations can be reduced to once every 7 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable. If any visible emissions are observed, daily observations shall be resumed.

              (iv) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 performance tests, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using a digital opacity compliance system according to a site-specific monitoring plan approved by the Administrator. The observations must be similar, but not necessarily identical, to the requirements in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section. For reference purposes in preparing the monitoring plan, see OAQPS “Determination of Visible Emission Opacity from Stationary Sources Using Computer-Based Photographic Analysis Systems.” This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality and Planning Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emission Measurement Center Preliminary Methods.
              (4) An owner or operator of an affected facility that is subject to an opacity standard under § 60.42Da is not required to operate a COMS provided that affected facility meets the conditions in either paragraph (a)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section.

              (i) The affected facility combusts only gaseous and/or liquid fuels (excluding residue oil) where the potential SO2 emissions rate of each fuel is no greater than 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu), and the unit operates according to a written site-specific monitoring plan approved by the permitting authority. This monitoring plan must include procedures and criteria for establishing and monitoring specific parameters for the affected facility indicative of compliance with the opacity standard. For testing performed as part of this site-specific monitoring plan, the permitting authority may require as an alternative to the notification and reporting requirements specified in §§ 60.8 and 60.11 that the owner or operator submit any deviations with the excess emissions report required under § 60.51Da(d).
              (ii) The owner or operator of the affected facility installs, calibrates, operates, and maintains a particulate matter continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS) according to the requirements specified in subpart UUUUU of part 63.

              (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS, and record the output of the system, for measuring SO2 emissions, except where only gaseous and/or liquid fuels (excluding residual oil) where the potential SO2 emissions rate of each fuel is 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less are combusted, as follows:

              (1) Sulfur dioxide emissions are monitored at both the inlet and outlet of the SO2 control device.

              (2) For a facility that qualifies under the numerical limit provisions of § 60.43Da, SO2 emissions are only monitored as discharged to the atmosphere.

              (3) An “as fired” fuel monitoring system (upstream of coal pulverizers) meeting the requirements of Method 19 of appendix A of this part may be used to determine potential SO2 emissions in place of a continuous SO2 emission monitor at the inlet to the SO2 control device as required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

              (4) If the owner or operator has installed and certified a SO2 CEMS according to the requirements of § 75.20(c)(1) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, and is continuing to meet the ongoing quality assurance requirements of § 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, that CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, provided that:
              (i) A CO2 or O2 continuous monitoring system is installed, calibrated, maintained and operated at the same location, according to paragraph (d) of this section; and
              (ii) For sources subject to an SO2 emission limit in lb/MMBtu under § 60.43Da:
              (A) When relative accuracy testing is conducted, SO2 concentration data and CO2 (or O2) data are collected simultaneously; and
              (B) In addition to meeting the applicable SO2 and CO2 (or O2) relative accuracy specifications in Figure 2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the relative accuracy (RA) standard in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part is met when the RA is calculated on a lb/MMBtu basis; and

              (iii) The reporting requirements of § 60.51Da are met. The SO2 and, if required, CO2 (or O2) data reported to meet the requirements of § 60.51Da shall not include substitute data values derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the SO2 data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.

              (c)(1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS, and record the output of the system, for measuring NOX emissions discharged to the atmosphere; or
              (2) If the owner or operator has installed a NOX emission rate CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter and is continuing to meet the ongoing requirements of part 75 of this chapter, that CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, except that the owner or operator shall also meet the requirements of § 60.51Da. Data reported to meet the requirements of § 60.51Da shall not include data substituted using the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.

              (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility not complying with an output based limit shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS, and record the output of the system, for measuring the O2 or carbon dioxide (CO2) content of the flue gases at each location where SO2 or NOX emissions are monitored. For affected facilities subject to a lb/MMBtu SO2 emission limit under § 60.43Da, if the owner or operator has installed and certified a CO2 or O2 monitoring system according to § 75.20(c) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter and the monitoring system continues to meet the applicable quality-assurance provisions of § 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, that CEMS may be used together with the part 75 SO2 concentration monitoring system described in paragraph (b) of this section, to determine the SO2 emission rate in lb/MMBtu. SO2 data used to meet the requirements of § 60.51Da shall not include substitute data values derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.
              (e) The CEMS under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section are operated and data recorded during all periods of operation of the affected facility including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments.
              (f)(1) For units that began construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005, the owner or operator shall obtain emission data for at least 18 hours in at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days. If this minimum data requirement cannot be met with CEMS, the owner or operator shall supplement emission data with other monitoring systems approved by the Administrator or the reference methods and procedures as described in paragraph (h) of this section.
              (2) For units that began construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005, the owner or operator shall obtain emission data for at least 90 percent of all operating hours for each 30 successive boiler operating days. If this minimum data requirement cannot be met with a CEMS, the owner or operator shall supplement emission data with other monitoring systems approved by the Administrator or the reference methods and procedures as described in paragraph (h) of this section.
              (g) The 1-hour averages required under paragraph § 60.13(h) are expressed in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) heat input and used to calculate the average emission rates under § 60.48Da. The 1-hour averages are calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(h)(2).
              (h) When it becomes necessary to supplement CEMS data to meet the minimum data requirements in paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator shall use the reference methods and procedures as specified in this paragraph. Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (j) of this section.

              (1) Method 6 of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine the SO2 concentration at the same location as the SO2 monitor. Samples shall be taken at 60-minute intervals. The sampling time and sample volume for each sample shall be at least 20 minutes and 0.020 dscm (0.71 dscf). Each sample represents a 1-hour average.

              (2) Method 7 of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine the NOX concentration at the same location as the NOX monitor. Samples shall be taken at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average of two consecutive samples represents a 1-hour average.

              (3) The emission rate correction factor, integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine the O2 or CO2 concentration at the same location as the O2 or CO2 monitor.

              (2) SO2 or NOX (NO), as applicable, shall be used for preparing the calibration gas mixtures (in N2, as applicable) under Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part.

              (3) For affected facilities burning only fossil fuel, the span value for a COMS is between 60 and 80 percent. Span values for a CEMS measuring NOX shall be determined using one of the following procedures:

              (i) Except as provided under paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section, NOX span values shall be determined as follows:
              
                
                  Fossil fuel

              (4) All span values computed under paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section for burning combinations of fossil fuels are rounded to the nearest 500 ppm. Span values computed under paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section shall be rounded off according to section 2.1.2 in appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.

              (5) For affected facilities burning fossil fuel, alone or in combination with non-fossil fuel and determining span values under paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section, the span value of the SO2 CEMS at the inlet to the SO2 control device is 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential emissions of the fuel fired, and the outlet of the SO2 control device is 50 percent of maximum estimated hourly potential emissions of the fuel fired.

Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall not be used after wet FGD systems if the effluent is saturated or laden with water droplets.
              (2) The Fc factor (CO2) procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part may be used to compute the emission rate of PM under the stipulations of § 60.46(d)(1). The CO2 shall be determined in the same manner as the O2 concentration.

              (f) The owner or operator of an electric utility combined cycle gas turbine that does not meet the definition of an IGCC must conduct performance tests for PM, SO2, and NOX using the procedures of Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part. The SO2 and NOX emission rates calculations from the gas turbine used in Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part are determined when the gas turbine is performance tested under subpart GG of this part. The potential uncontrolled PM emission rate from a gas turbine is defined as 17 ng/J (0.04 lb/MMBtu) heat input.

                ER13JN07.024
              
              
                Where:
                
                En = NOX emission limit (expressed as NO2), ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                ELgo = Appropriate emission limit from paragraph (a)(1) for combustion of natural gas or distillate oil, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                Hgo = Heat input from combustion of natural gas or distillate oil, J (MMBtu);
                
                ELro = Appropriate emission limit from paragraph (a)(2) for combustion of residual oil, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                Hro = Heat input from combustion of residual oil, J (MMBtu);
                ELc = Appropriate emission limit from paragraph (a)(3) for combustion of coal, ng/J (lb/MMBtu); and
                Hc = Heat input from combustion of coal, J (MMBtu).
              
              

              (c) Except as provided under paragraph (d) and (l) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that simultaneously combusts coal or oil, natural gas (or any combination of the three), and wood, or any other fuel shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain NOX in excess of the emission limit for the coal, oil, natural gas (or any combination of the three), combusted in the affected facility, as determined pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. This standard does not apply to an affected facility that is subject to and in compliance with a federally enforceable requirement that limits operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent (0.10) or less for coal, oil, natural gas (or any combination of the three).

              (d) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that simultaneously combusts natural gas and/or distillate oil with a potential SO2 emissions rate of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less with wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other solid fuel, except coal, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain NOX in excess of 130 ng/J (0.30 lb/MMBtu) heat input unless the affected facility has an annual capacity factor for natural gas, distillate oil, or a mixture of these fuels of 10 percent (0.10) or less and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement that limits operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent (0.10) or less for natural gas, distillate oil, or a mixture of these fuels.

              (e) Except as provided under paragraph (l) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that simultaneously combusts only coal, oil, or natural gas with byproduct/waste shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain NOX in excess of the emission limit determined by the following formula unless the affected facility has an annual capacity factor for coal, oil, and natural gas of 10 percent (0.10) or less and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement that limits operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent (0.10) or less:

              (f) Any owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts byproduct/waste with either natural gas or oil may petition the Administrator within 180 days of the initial startup of the affected facility to establish a NOX emission limit that shall apply specifically to that affected facility when the byproduct/waste is combusted. The petition shall include sufficient and appropriate data, as determined by the Administrator, such as NOX emissions from the affected facility, waste composition (including nitrogen content), and combustion conditions to allow the Administrator to confirm that the affected facility is unable to comply with the emission limits in paragraph (e) of this section and to determine the appropriate emission limit for the affected facility.

              (1) Any owner or operator of an affected facility petitioning for a facility-specific NOX emission limit under this section shall:
              (i) Demonstrate compliance with the emission limits for natural gas and distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, by conducting a 30-day performance test as provided in § 60.46b(e). During the performance test only natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil shall be combusted in the affected facility; and

              (ii) Demonstrate that the affected facility is unable to comply with the emission limits for natural gas and distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, when gaseous or liquid byproduct/waste is combusted in the affected facility under the same conditions and using the same technological system of emission reduction applied when demonstrating compliance under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
              (2) The NOX emission limits for natural gas or distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, shall be applicable to the affected facility until and unless the petition is approved by the Administrator. If the petition is approved by the Administrator, a facility-specific NOX emission limit will be established at the NOX emission level achievable when the affected facility is combusting oil or natural gas and byproduct/waste in a manner that the Administrator determines to be consistent with minimizing NOX emissions. In lieu of amending this subpart, a letter will be sent to the facility describing the facility-specific NOX limit. The facility shall use the compliance procedures detailed in the letter and make the letter available to the public. If the Administrator determines it is appropriate, the conditions and requirements of the letter can be reviewed and changed at any point.

              (g) Any owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts hazardous waste (as defined by 40 CFR part 261 or 40 CFR part 761) with natural gas or oil may petition the Administrator within 180 days of the initial startup of the affected facility for a waiver from compliance with the NOX emission limit that applies specifically to that affected facility. The petition must include sufficient and appropriate data, as determined by the Administrator, on NOX emissions from the affected facility, waste destruction efficiencies, waste composition (including nitrogen content), the quantity of specific wastes to be combusted and combustion conditions to allow the Administrator to determine if the affected facility is able to comply with the NOX emission limits required by this section. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall demonstrate that when hazardous waste is combusted in the affected facility, thermal destruction efficiency requirements for hazardous waste specified in an applicable federally enforceable requirement preclude compliance with the NOX emission limits of this section. The NOX emission limits for natural gas or distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, are applicable to the affected facility until and unless the petition is approved by the Administrator. (See 40 CFR 761.70 for regulations applicable to the incineration of materials containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).) In lieu of amending this subpart, a letter will be sent to the facility describing the facility-specific NOX limit. The facility shall use the compliance procedures detailed in the letter and make the letter available to the public. If the Administrator determines it is appropriate, the conditions and requirements of the letter can be reviewed and changed at any point.

              (h) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, the NOX standards under this section apply at all times including periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
              (i) Except as provided under paragraph (j) of this section, compliance with the emission limits under this section is determined on a 30-day rolling average basis.
              (j) Compliance with the emission limits under this section is determined on a 24-hour average basis for the initial performance test and on a 3-hour average basis for subsequent performance tests for any affected facilities that:
              (1) Combust, alone or in combination, only natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less;
              (2) Have a combined annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less for natural gas, distillate oil, and residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less; and

              (3) Are subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to the firing of natural gas, distillate oil, and/or residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less and limiting operation of the affected facility to a combined annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less for natural gas, distillate oil, and residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less.

              (k) Affected facilities that meet the criteria described in paragraphs (j)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, and that have a heat input capacity of 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less, are not subject to the NOX emission limits under this section.
              (l) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under 60.8, whichever date is first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction after July 9, 1997 shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain NOx (expressed as NO2) in excess of the following limits:
              (1) 86 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts coal, oil, or natural gas (or any combination of the three), alone or with any other fuels. The affected facility is not subject to this limit if it is subject to and in compliance with a federally enforceable requirement that limits operation of the facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent (0.10) or less for coal, oil, and natural gas (or any combination of the three); or
              (2) If the affected facility has a low heat release rate and combusts natural gas or distillate oil in excess of 30 percent of the heat input on a 30-day rolling average from the combustion of all fuels, a limit determined by use of the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.026
              
              
                Where:
                
                En = NOX emission limit, (lb/MMBtu);
                Hgo = 30-day heat input from combustion of natural gas or distillate oil; and
                Hr = 30-day heat input from combustion of any other fuel.
              
              
              (3) After February 27, 2006, units where more than 10 percent of total annual output is electrical or mechanical may comply with an optional limit of 270 ng/J (2.1 lb/MWh) gross energy output, based on a 30-day rolling average. Units complying with this output-based limit must demonstrate compliance according to the procedures of § 60.48Da(i) of subpart Da of this part, and must monitor emissions according to § 60.49Da(c), (k), through (n) of subpart Da of this part.
              [72 FR 32742, June 13, 2007, as amended at 74 FR 5086, Jan. 28, 2009; 77 FR 9459, Feb. 16, 2012]
            
            
              § 60.45b
              Compliance and performance test methods and procedures for sulfur dioxide.
              (a) The SO2 emission standards in § 60.42b apply at all times. Facilities burning coke oven gas alone or in combination with any other gaseous fuels or distillate oil are allowed to exceed the limit 30 operating days per calendar year for SO2 control system maintenance.
              (b) In conducting the performance tests required under § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use the methods and procedures in appendix A (including fuel certification and sampling) of this part or the methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b). Section 60.8(f) does not apply to this section. The 30-day notice required in § 60.8(d) applies only to the initial performance test unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.

              (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct performance tests to determine compliance with the percent of potential SO2 emission rate (% Ps) and the SO2 emission rate (Es) pursuant to § 60.42b following the procedures listed below, except as provided under paragraph (d) and (k) of this section.

              (1) The initial performance test shall be conducted over 30 consecutive operating days of the steam generating unit. Compliance with the SO2 standards shall be determined using a 30-day average. The first operating day included in the initial performance test shall be scheduled within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial startup of the facility.
              
              (2) If only coal, only oil, or a mixture of coal and oil is combusted, the following procedures are used:

              (i) The procedures in Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part are used to determine the hourly SO2 emission rate (Eho) and the 30-day average emission rate (Eao). The hourly averages used to compute the 30-day averages are obtained from the CEMS of § 60.47b(a) or (b).
              (ii) The percent of potential SO2 emission rate (%Ps) emitted to the atmosphere is computed using the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.027
              
              
                Where:
                
                %Ps = Potential SO2 emission rate, percent;
                %Rg = SO2 removal efficiency of the control device as determined by Method 19 of appendix A of this part, in percent; and
                %Rf = SO2 removal efficiency of fuel pretreatment as determined by Method 19 of appendix A of this part, in percent.
              
              
              (3) If coal or oil is combusted with other fuels, the same procedures required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are used, except as provided in the following:
              (i) An adjusted hourly SO2 emission rate (Eho

                o) is used in Equation 19-19 of Method 19 of appendix A of this part to compute an adjusted 30-day average emission rate (Eao
                o). The Eho° is computed using the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.028
              
              
                Where:
                
                Eho
                  o = Adjusted hourly SO2 emission rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                Eho = Hourly SO2 emission rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                Ew = SO2 concentration in fuels other than coal and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by the fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part, ng/J (lb/MMBtu). The value Ew for each fuel lot is used for each hourly average during the time that the lot is being combusted; and
                Xk = Fraction of total heat input from fuel combustion derived from coal, oil, or coal and oil, as determined by applicable procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
              
              
              (ii) To compute the percent of potential SO2 emission rate (%Ps), an adjusted %Rg (%Rg
                o) is computed from the adjusted Eao

                o from paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and an adjusted average SO2 inlet rate (Eai
                o) using the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.029
              
              To compute Eai
                o, an adjusted hourly SO2 inlet rate (Ehi
                o) is used. The Ehi
                o is computed using the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.030
              
              
                Where:
                
                Ehi
                  o = Adjusted hourly SO2 inlet rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu); and
                Ehi = Hourly SO2 inlet rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu).
              
              

              (4) The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not have to measure parameters Ew or Xk if the owner or operator elects to assume that Xk = 1.0. Owners or operators of affected facilities who assume Xk = 1.0 shall:
              (i) Determine %Ps following the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and
              (ii) Sulfur dioxide emissions (Es) are considered to be in compliance with SO2 emission limits under § 60.42b.

              (5) The owner or operator of an affected facility that qualifies under the provisions of § 60.42b(d) does not have to measure parameters Ew or Xk in paragraph (c)(3) of this section if the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to measure SO2 emission rates of the coal or oil following the fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.

              (d) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts only very low sulfur oil, natural gas, or a mixture of these fuels, has an annual capacity factor for oil of 10 percent (0.10) or less, and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor for oil of 10 percent (0.10) or less shall:
              
              (1) Conduct the initial performance test over 24 consecutive steam generating unit operating hours at full load;
              (2) Determine compliance with the standards after the initial performance test based on the arithmetic average of the hourly emissions data during each steam generating unit operating day if a CEMS is used, or based on a daily average if Method 6B of appendix A of this part or fuel sampling and analysis procedures under Method 19 of appendix A of this part are used.
              (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to § 60.42b(d)(1) shall demonstrate the maximum design capacity of the steam generating unit by operating the facility at maximum capacity for 24 hours. This demonstration will be made during the initial performance test and a subsequent demonstration may be requested at any other time. If the 24-hour average firing rate for the affected facility is less than the maximum design capacity provided by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the 24-hour average firing rate shall be used to determine the capacity utilization rate for the affected facility, otherwise the maximum design capacity provided by the manufacturer is used.

              (f) For the initial performance test required under § 60.8, compliance with the SO2 emission limits and percent reduction requirements under § 60.42b is based on the average emission rates and the average percent reduction for SO2 for the first 30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days, except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section. The initial performance test is the only test for which at least 30 days prior notice is required unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The initial performance test is to be scheduled so that the first steam generating unit operating day of the 30 successive steam generating unit operating days is completed within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial startup of the facility. The boiler load during the 30-day period does not have to be the maximum design load, but must be representative of future operating conditions and include at least one 24-hour period at full load.

              (g) After the initial performance test required under § 60.8, compliance with the SO2 emission limits and percent reduction requirements under § 60.42b is based on the average emission rates and the average percent reduction for SO2 for 30 successive steam generating unit operating days, except as provided under paragraph (d). A separate performance test is completed at the end of each steam generating unit operating day after the initial performance test, and a new 30-day average emission rate and percent reduction for SO2 are calculated to show compliance with the standard.

              (h) Except as provided under paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall use all valid SO2 emissions data in calculating %Ps and Eho under paragraph (c), of this section whether or not the minimum emissions data requirements under § 60.46b are achieved. All valid emissions data, including valid SO2 emission data collected during periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction, shall be used in calculating %Ps and Eho pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

              (i) During periods of malfunction or maintenance of the SO2 control systems when oil is combusted as provided under § 60.42b(i), emission data are not used to calculate %Ps or Es under § 60.42b(a), (b) or (c), however, the emissions data are used to determine compliance with the emission limit under § 60.42b(i).

              (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility that only combusts very low sulfur oil, natural gas, or a mixture of these fuels with any other fuels not subject to an SO2 standard is not subject to the compliance and performance testing requirements of this section if the owner or operator obtains fuel receipts as described in § 60.49b(r).
              (k) The owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to demonstrate compliance in §§ 60.42b(d)(4), 60.42b(j), 60.42b(k)(2), and 60.42b(k)(3) (when not burning coal) shall follow the applicable procedures in § 60.49b(r).

              § 60.46b
              Compliance and performance test methods and procedures for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.

              (a) The PM emission standards and opacity limits under § 60.43b apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. The NOX emission standards under § 60.44b apply at all times.
              (b) Compliance with the PM emission standards under § 60.43b shall be determined through performance testing as described in paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
              (c) Compliance with the NOX emission standards under § 60.44b shall be determined through performance testing under paragraph (e) or (f), or under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, as applicable.
              (d) To determine compliance with the PM emission limits and opacity limits under § 60.43b, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8, and shall conduct subsequent performance tests as requested by the Administrator, using the following procedures and reference methods:
              (1) Method 3A or 3B of appendix A-2 of this part is used for gas analysis when applying Method 5 of appendix A-3 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part.
              (2) Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part shall be used to measure the concentration of PM as follows:
              (i) Method 5 of appendix A of this part shall be used at affected facilities without wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems; and
              (ii) Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part may be used at facilities with or without wet scrubber systems provided the stack gas temperature does not exceed a temperature of 160 °C (320 °F). The procedures of sections 8.1 and 11.1 of Method 5B of appendix A-3 of this part may be used in Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part only if it is used after a wet FGD system. Do not use Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part after wet FGD systems if the effluent is saturated or laden with water droplets.
              (iii) Method 5B of appendix A of this part is to be used only after wet FGD systems.
              (3) Method 1 of appendix A of this part is used to select the sampling site and the number of traverse sampling points. The sampling time for each run is at least 120 minutes and the minimum sampling volume is 1.7 dscm (60 dscf) except that smaller sampling times or volumes may be approved by the Administrator when necessitated by process variables or other factors.
              (4) For Method 5 of appendix A of this part, the temperature of the sample gas in the probe and filter holder is monitored and is maintained at 160±14 °C (320±25 °F).
              (5) For determination of PM emissions, the oxygen (O2) or CO2 sample is obtained simultaneously with each run of Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part by traversing the duct at the same sampling location.
              (6) For each run using Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part, the emission rate expressed in ng/J heat input is determined using:
              (i) The O2 or CO2 measurements and PM measurements obtained under this section;
              (ii) The dry basis F factor; and
              (iii) The dry basis emission rate calculation procedure contained in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
              (7) Method 9 of appendix A of this part is used for determining the opacity of stack emissions.

              (e) To determine compliance with the emission limits for NOX required under § 60.44b, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct the performance test as required under § 60.8 using the continuous system for monitoring NOX under § 60.48(b).
              (1) For the initial compliance test, NOX from the steam generating unit are monitored for 30 successive steam generating unit operating days and the 30-day average emission rate is used to determine compliance with the NOX emission standards under § 60.44b. The 30-day average emission rate is calculated as the average of all hourly emissions data recorded by the monitoring system during the 30-day test period.

              (2) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed in § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility which combusts coal (except as specified under § 60.46b(e)(4)) or which combusts residual oil having a nitrogen content greater than 0.30 weight percent shall determine compliance with the NOX emission standards in § 60.44b on a continuous basis through the use of a 30-day rolling average emission rate. A new 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated for each steam generating unit operating day as the average of all of the hourly NOX emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.

              (3) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility that has a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) and that combusts natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil having a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less shall determine compliance with the NOX standards under § 60.44b on a continuous basis through the use of a 30-day rolling average emission rate. A new 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated each steam generating unit operating day as the average of all of the hourly NOX emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.

              (4) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility that has a heat input capacity of 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less and that combusts natural gas, distillate oil, gasified coal, or residual oil having a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less shall upon request determine compliance with the NOX standards in § 60.44b through the use of a 30-day performance test. During periods when performance tests are not requested, NOX emissions data collected pursuant to § 60.48b(g)(1) or § 60.48b(g)(2) are used to calculate a 30-day rolling average emission rate on a daily basis and used to prepare excess emission reports, but will not be used to determine compliance with the NOX emission standards. A new 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated each steam generating unit operating day as the average of all of the hourly NOX emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.
              (5) If the owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts residual oil does not sample and analyze the residual oil for nitrogen content, as specified in § 60.49b(e), the requirements of § 60.48b(g)(1) apply and the provisions of § 60.48b(g)(2) are inapplicable.

              (f) To determine compliance with the emissions limits for NOX required by § 60.44b(a)(4) or § 60.44b(l) for duct burners used in combined cycle systems, either of the procedures described in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section may be used:
              (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct the performance test required under § 60.8 as follows:
              (i) The emissions rate (E) of NOX shall be computed using Equation 1 in this section:
              
                ER13JN07.031
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = Emissions rate of NOX from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/MMBtu) heat input;
                Esg = Combined effluent emissions rate, in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) heat input using appropriate F factor as described in Method 19 of appendix A of this part;
                Hg = Heat input rate to the combustion turbine, in J/hr (MMBtu/hr);
                Hb = Heat input rate to the duct burner, in J/hr (MMBtu/hr); and
                Eg = Emissions rate from the combustion turbine, in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) heat input calculated using appropriate F factor as described in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
              
              

              (ii) Method 7E of appendix A of this part or Method 320 of appendix A of part 63 shall be used to determine the NOX concentrations. Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine O2 concentration.

              (iii) The owner or operator shall identify and demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction suitable methods to determine the average hourly heat input rate to the combustion turbine and the average hourly heat input rate to the affected duct burner.
              
              (iv) Compliance with the emissions limits under § 60.44b(a)(4) or § 60.44b(l) is determined by the three-run average (nominal 1-hour runs) for the initial and subsequent performance tests; or

              (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility may elect to determine compliance on a 30-day rolling average basis by using the CEMS specified under § 60.48b for measuring NOX and O2 and meet the requirements of § 60.48b. The sampling site shall be located at the outlet from the steam generating unit. The NOX emissions rate at the outlet from the steam generating unit shall constitute the NOX emissions rate from the duct burner of the combined cycle system.

              (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility described in § 60.44b(j) or § 60.44b(k) shall demonstrate the maximum heat input capacity of the steam generating unit by operating the facility at maximum capacity for 24 hours. The owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine the maximum heat input capacity using the heat loss method or the heat input method described in sections 5 and 7.3 of the ASME Power Test Codes 4.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). This demonstration of maximum heat input capacity shall be made during the initial performance test for affected facilities that meet the criteria of § 60.44b(j). It shall be made within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial start-up of each facility, for affected facilities meeting the criteria of § 60.44b(k). Subsequent demonstrations may be required by the Administrator at any other time. If this demonstration indicates that the maximum heat input capacity of the affected facility is less than that stated by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the maximum heat input capacity determined during this demonstration shall be used to determine the capacity utilization rate for the affected facility. Otherwise, the maximum heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer is used.
              (h) The owner or operator of an affected facility described in § 60.44b(j) that has a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) shall:

              (1) Conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8 over a minimum of 24 consecutive steam generating unit operating hours at maximum heat input capacity to demonstrate compliance with the NOX emission standards under § 60.44b using Method 7, 7A, or 7E of appendix A of this part, Method 320 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter, or other approved reference methods; and

              (2) Conduct subsequent performance tests once per calendar year or every 400 hours of operation (whichever comes first) to demonstrate compliance with the NOX emission standards under § 60.44b over a minimum of 3 consecutive steam generating unit operating hours at maximum heat input capacity using Method 7, 7A, or 7E of appendix A of this part, Method 320 of appendix A of part 63, or other approved reference methods.
              (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to demonstrate compliance with the PM limit in paragraphs § 60.43b(a)(4) or § 60.43b(h)(5) shall follow the applicable procedures in § 60.49b(r).
              (j) In place of PM testing with Method 5 or 5B of appendix A-3 of this part, or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part, an owner or operator may elect to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring PM emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to continuously monitor PM emissions instead of conducting performance testing using Method 5 or 5B of appendix A-3 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (j)(14) of this section.
              (1) Notify the Administrator one month before starting use of the system.
              (2) Notify the Administrator one month before stopping use of the system.
              (3) The monitor shall be installed, evaluated, and operated in accordance with § 60.13 of subpart A of this part.

              (4) The initial performance evaluation shall be completed no later than 180 days after the date of initial startup of the affected facility, as specified under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part or within 180 days of notification to the Administrator of use of the CEMS if the owner or operator was previously determining compliance by Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part performance tests, whichever is later.
              (5) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test for PM emissions as required under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part. Compliance with the PM emission limit shall be determined by using the CEMS specified in paragraph (j) of this section to measure PM and calculating a 24-hour block arithmetic average emission concentration using EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A of this part, section 4.1.
              (6) Compliance with the PM emission limit shall be determined based on the 24-hour daily (block) average of the hourly arithmetic average emission concentrations using CEMS outlet data.
              (7) At a minimum, valid CEMS hourly averages shall be obtained as specified in paragraphs (j)(7)(i) of this section for 75 percent of the total operating hours per 30-day rolling average.
              (i) At least two data points per hour shall be used to calculate each 1-hour arithmetic average.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (8) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required under paragraph (j)(7) of this section shall be expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and shall be used to calculate the boiler operating day daily arithmetic average emission concentrations. The 1-hour arithmetic averages shall be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of this part.
              (9) All valid CEMS data shall be used in calculating average emission concentrations even if the minimum CEMS data requirements of paragraph (j)(7) of this section are not met.
              (10) The CEMS shall be operated according to Performance Specification 11 in appendix B of this part.

              (11) During the correlation testing runs of the CEMS required by Performance Specification 11 in appendix B of this part, PM and O2 (or CO2) data shall be collected concurrently (or within a 30-to 60-minute period) by both the continuous emission monitors and performance tests conducted using the following test methods.
              (i) For PM, Method 5 or 5B of appendix A-3 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall be used; and
              (ii) For O2 (or CO2), Method 3A or 3B of appendix A-2 of this part, as applicable shall be used.
              (12) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests shall be performed in accordance with procedure 2 in appendix F of this part. Relative Response Audit's must be performed annually and Response Correlation Audits must be performed every 3 years.
              (13) When PM emissions data are not obtained because of CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, emissions data shall be obtained by using other monitoring systems as approved by the Administrator or EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A of this part to provide, as necessary, valid emissions data for a minimum of 75 percent of total operating hours per 30-day rolling average.

              (14) As of January 1, 2012, and within 90 days after the date of completing each performance test, as defined in § 60.8, conducted to demonstrate compliance with this subpart, you must submit relative accuracy test audit (i.e., reference method) data and performance test (i.e., compliance test) data, except opacity data, electronically to EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) by using the Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/ert_tool.html/) or other compatible electronic spreadsheet. Only data collected using test methods compatible with ERT are subject to this requirement to be submitted electronically into EPA's WebFIRE database.

              § 60.47b
              Emission monitoring for sulfur dioxide.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the SO2 standards in § 60.42b shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate CEMS for measuring SO2 concentrations and either O2 or CO2 concentrations and shall record the output of the systems. For units complying with the percent reduction standard, the SO2 and either O2 or CO2 concentrations shall both be monitored at the inlet and outlet of the SO2 control device. If the owner or operator has installed and certified SO2 and O2 or CO2 CEMS according to the requirements of § 75.20(c)(1) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, and is continuing to meet the ongoing quality assurance requirements of § 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, those CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, provided that:
              (1) When relative accuracy testing is conducted, SO2 concentration data and CO2 (or O2) data are collected simultaneously; and
              (2) In addition to meeting the applicable SO2 and CO2 (or O2) relative accuracy specifications in Figure 2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the relative accuracy (RA) standard in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part is met when the RA is calculated on a lb/MMBtu basis; and

              (3) The reporting requirements of § 60.49b are met. SO2 and CO2 (or O2) data used to meet the requirements of § 60.49b shall not include substitute data values derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the SO2 data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.

              (b) As an alternative to operating CEMS as required under paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the average SO2 emissions and percent reduction by:

              (1) Collecting coal or oil samples in an as-fired condition at the inlet to the steam generating unit and analyzing them for sulfur and heat content according to Method 19 of appendix A of this part. Method 19 of appendix A of this part provides procedures for converting these measurements into the format to be used in calculating the average SO2 input rate, or
              (2) Measuring SO2 according to Method 6B of appendix A of this part at the inlet or outlet to the SO2 control system. An initial stratification test is required to verify the adequacy of the sampling location for Method 6B of appendix A of this part. The stratification test shall consist of three paired runs of a suitable SO2 and CO2 measurement train operated at the candidate location and a second similar train operated according to the procedures in Section 3.2 and the applicable procedures in Section 7 of Performance Specification 2. Method 6B of appendix A of this part, Method 6A of appendix A of this part, or a combination of Methods 6 and 3 or 3B of appendix A of this part or Methods 6C or Method 320 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter and 3A of appendix A of this part are suitable measurement techniques. If Method 6B of appendix A of this part is used for the second train, sampling time and timer operation may be adjusted for the stratification test as long as an adequate sample volume is collected; however, both sampling trains are to be operated similarly. For the location to be adequate for Method 6B of appendix A of this part, 24-hour tests, the mean of the absolute difference between the three paired runs must be less than 10 percent.
              (3) A daily SO2 emission rate, ED, shall be determined using the procedure described in Method 6A of appendix A of this part, section 7.6.2 (Equation 6A-8) and stated in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) heat input.
              (4) The mean 30-day emission rate is calculated using the daily measured values in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) for 30 successive steam generating unit operating days using equation 19-20 of Method 19 of appendix A of this part.

              (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain emission data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours in at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days. If this minimum data requirement is not met with a single monitoring system, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall supplement the emission data with data collected with other monitoring systems as approved by the Administrator or the reference methods and procedures as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (d) The 1-hour average SO2 emission rates measured by the CEMS required by paragraph (a) of this section and required under § 60.13(h) is expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and is used to calculate the average emission rates under § 60.42(b). Each 1-hour average SO2 emission rate must be based on 30 or more minutes of steam generating unit operation. The hourly averages shall be calculated according to § 60.13(h)(2). Hourly SO2 emission rates are not calculated if the affected facility is operated less than 30 minutes in a given clock hour and are not counted toward determination of a steam generating unit operating day.
              (e) The procedures under § 60.13 shall be followed for installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS.
              (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, all CEMS shall be operated in accordance with the applicable procedures under Performance Specifications 1, 2, and 3 of appendix B of this part.
              (2) Except as provided for in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests shall be performed in accordance with Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part.

              (3) For affected facilities combusting coal or oil, alone or in combination with other fuels, the span value of the SO2 CEMS at the inlet to the SO2 control device is 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO2 emissions of the fuel combusted, and the span value of the CEMS at the outlet to the SO2 control device is 50 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO2 emissions of the fuel combusted. Alternatively, SO2 span values determined according to section 2.1.1 in appendix A to part 75 of this chapter may be used.
              (4) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, the owner or operator may elect to implement the following alternative data accuracy assessment procedures:
              (i) For all required CO2 and O2 monitors and for SO2 and NOX monitors with span values greater than or equal to 100 ppm, the daily calibration error test and calibration adjustment procedures described in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter may be followed instead of the CD assessment procedures in Procedure 1, section 4.1 of appendix F to this part.
              (ii) For all required CO2 and O2 monitors and for SO2 and NOX monitors with span values greater than 30 ppm, quarterly linearity checks may be performed in accordance with section 2.2.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, instead of performing the cylinder gas audits (CGAs) described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2 of appendix F to this part. If this option is selected: The frequency of the linearity checks shall be as specified in section 2.2.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable linearity specifications in section 3.2 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 2.2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.2.4 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the cylinder gas audits described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2 of appendix F to this part shall be performed for SO2 and NOX span values less than or equal to 30 ppm; and
              (iii) For SO2, CO2, and O2 monitoring systems and for NOX emission rate monitoring systems, RATAs may be performed in accordance with section 2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter instead of following the procedures described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.1 of appendix F to this part. If this option is selected: The frequency of each RATA shall be as specified in section 2.3.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable relative accuracy specifications shown in Figure 2 in appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 2.3.2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.3.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the relative accuracy specification in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part shall be met on a lb/MMBtu basis for SO2 (regardless of the SO2 emission level during the RATA), and for NOX when the average NOX emission rate measured by the reference method during the RATA is less than 0.100 lb/MMBtu.
              (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts very low sulfur oil or is demonstrating compliance under § 60.45b(k) is not subject to the emission monitoring requirements under paragraph (a) of this section if the owner or operator maintains fuel records as described in § 60.49b(r).

              § 60.48b
              Emission monitoring for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the opacity standard under § 60.43b shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS) for measuring the opacity of emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard under § 60.43b and meeting the conditions under paragraphs (j)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) of this section who elects not to use a COMS shall conduct a performance test using Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limit in § 60.43b by April 29, 2011, within 45 days of stopping use of an existing COMS, or within 180 days after initial startup of the facility, whichever is later, and shall comply with either paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section. The observation period for Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests may be reduced from 3 hours to 60 minutes if all 6-minute averages are less than 10 percent and all individual 15-second observations are less than or equal to 20 percent during the initial 60 minutes of observation.

If the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is greater than 5 percent of the observation period (i.e., 90 seconds per 30 minute period), the owner or operator shall either document and adjust the operation of the facility and demonstrate within 24 hours that the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is equal to or less than 5 percent during a 30 minute observation (i.e., 90 seconds) or conduct a new Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test using the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section within 45 calendar days according to the requirements in § 60.46d(d)(7).
              (ii) If no visible emissions are observed for 10 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable, observations can be reduced to once every 7 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable. If any visible emissions are observed, daily observations shall be resumed.
              (3) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 performance tests, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using a digital opacity compliance system according to a site-specific monitoring plan approved by the Administrator. The observations shall be similar, but not necessarily identical, to the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section and § 60.8(b), performance tests required under § 60.8 shall be conducted following the procedures specified in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, as applicable. Section 60.8(f) does not apply to this section. The 30-day notice required in § 60.8(d) applies only to the initial performance test unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.

              (b) The initial performance test required under § 60.8 shall be conducted over 30 consecutive operating days of the steam generating unit. Compliance with the percent reduction requirements and SO2 emission limits under § 60.42c shall be determined using a 30-day average. The first operating day included in the initial performance test shall be scheduled within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affect facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after the initial startup of the facility. The steam generating unit load during the 30-day period does not have to be the maximum design heat input capacity, but must be representative of future operating conditions.

              (c) After the initial performance test required under paragraph (b) of this section and § 60.8, compliance with the percent reduction requirements and SO2 emission limits under § 60.42c is based on the average percent reduction and the average SO2 emission rates for 30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days. A separate performance test is completed at the end of each steam generating unit operating day, and a new 30-day average percent reduction and SO2 emission rate are calculated to show compliance with the standard.

              (d) If only coal, only oil, or a mixture of coal and oil is combusted in an affected facility, the procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part are used to determine the hourly SO2 emission rate (Eho) and the 30-day average SO2 emission rate (Eao). The hourly averages used to compute the 30-day averages are obtained from the CEMS. Method 19 of appendix A of this part shall be used to calculate Eao when using daily fuel sampling or Method 6B of appendix A of this part.

              (e) If coal, oil, or coal and oil are combusted with other fuels:
              
              (1) An adjusted Eho (Ehoo) is used in Equation 19-19 of Method 19 of appendix A of this part to compute the adjusted Eao (Eaoo). The Ehoo is computed using the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.033
              
              
                Where:
                
                Ehoo = Adjusted Eho, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                Eho = Hourly SO2 emission rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                Ew = SO2 concentration in fuels other than coal and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 9 of appendix A of this part, ng/J (lb/MMBtu). The value Ew for each fuel lot is used for each hourly average during the time that the lot is being combusted. The owner or operator does not have to measure Ew if the owner or operator elects to assume Ew = 0.
                Xk = Fraction of the total heat input from fuel combustion derived from coal and oil, as determined by applicable procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
              
              

              (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility that qualifies under the provisions of § 60.42c(c) or (d) (where percent reduction is not required) does not have to measure the parameters Ew or Xk if the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to measure emission rates of the coal or oil using the fuel sampling and analysis procedures under Method 19 of appendix A of this part.

              (f) Affected facilities subject to the percent reduction requirements under § 60.42c(a) or (b) shall determine compliance with the SO2 emission limits under § 60.42c pursuant to paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, and shall determine compliance with the percent reduction requirements using the following procedures:

              (1) If only coal is combusted, the percent of potential SO2 emission rate is computed using the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.034
              
              
                Where:
                
                %Ps = Potential SO2 emission rate, in percent;
                %Rg = SO2 removal efficiency of the control device as determined by Method 19 of appendix A of this part, in percent; and
                %Rf = SO2 removal efficiency of fuel pretreatment as determined by Method 19 of appendix A of this part, in percent.
              
              
              (2) If coal, oil, or coal and oil are combusted with other fuels, the same procedures required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are used, except as provided for in the following:
              (i) To compute the %Ps, an adjusted %Rg (%Rgo) is computed from Eaoo from paragraph (e)(1) of this section and an adjusted average SO2 inlet rate (Eaio) using the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.035
              
              
                Where:
                
                %Rgo = Adjusted %Rg, in percent;
                Eaoo = Adjusted Eao, ng/J (lb/MMBtu); and
                Eaio = Adjusted average SO2 inlet rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu).
              
              
              (ii) To compute Eaio, an adjusted hourly SO2 inlet rate (Ehio) is used. The Ehio is computed using the following formula:
              
                ER13JN07.036
              
              
                Where:
                
                Ehio = Adjusted Ehi, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                Ehi = Hourly SO2 inlet rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
                Ew = SO2 concentration in fuels other than coal and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part, ng/J (lb/MMBtu). The value Ew for each fuel lot is used for each hourly average during the time that the lot is being combusted. The owner or operator does not have to measure Ew if the owner or operator elects to assume Ew = 0; and
                Xk = Fraction of the total heat input from fuel combustion derived from coal and oil, as determined by applicable procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
              
              

              (g) For oil-fired affected facilities where the owner or operator seeks to demonstrate compliance with the fuel oil sulfur limits under § 60.42c based on shipment fuel sampling, the initial performance test shall consist of sampling and analyzing the oil in the initial tank of oil to be fired in the steam generating unit to demonstrate that the oil contains 0.5 weight percent sulfur or less. Thereafter, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall sample the oil in the fuel tank after each new shipment of oil is received, as described under § 60.46c(d)(2).

              (h) For affected facilities subject to § 60.42c(h)(1), (2), or (3) where the owner or operator seeks to demonstrate compliance with the SO2 standards based on fuel supplier certification, the performance test shall consist of the certification from the fuel supplier, as described in § 60.48c(f), as applicable.

              (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to demonstrate compliance with the SO2 standards under § 60.42c(c)(2) shall demonstrate the maximum design heat input capacity of the steam generating unit by operating the steam generating unit at this capacity for 24 hours. This demonstration shall be made during the initial performance test, and a subsequent demonstration may be requested at any other time. If the demonstrated 24-hour average firing rate for the affected facility is less than the maximum design heat input capacity stated by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the demonstrated 24-hour average firing rate shall be used to determine the annual capacity factor for the affected facility; otherwise, the maximum design heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer shall be used.

              (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use all valid SO2 emissions data in calculating %Ps and Eho under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as applicable, whether or not the minimum emissions data requirements under § 60.46c(f) are achieved. All valid emissions data, including valid data collected during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, shall be used in calculating %Ps or Eho pursuant to paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as applicable.

The procedures of Sections 8.1 and 11.1 of Method 5B of appendix A of this part may be used in Method 17 of appendix A of this part only if Method 17 of appendix A of this part is used in conjunction with a wet scrubber system. Method 17 of appendix A of this part shall not be used in conjunction with a wet scrubber system if the effluent is saturated or laden with water droplets.
              (iii) Method 5B of appendix A of this part may be used in conjunction with a wet scrubber system.
              (4) The sampling time for each run shall be at least 120 minutes and the minimum sampling volume shall be 1.7 dry standard cubic meters (dscm) [60 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)] except that smaller sampling times or volumes may be approved by the Administrator when necessitated by process variables or other factors.

              (6) For determination of PM emissions, an oxygen (O2) or carbon dioxide (CO2) measurement shall be obtained simultaneously with each run of Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part by traversing the duct at the same sampling location.
              (7) For each run using Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part, the emission rates expressed in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) heat input shall be determined using:
              (i) The O2 or CO2 measurements and PM measurements obtained under this section, (ii) The dry basis F factor, and
              (iii) The dry basis emission rate calculation procedure contained in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
              (8) Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used for determining the opacity of stack emissions.

This demonstration shall be made during the initial performance test, and a subsequent demonstration may be requested at any other time. If the demonstrated 24-hour average firing rate for the affected facility is less than the maximum design heat input capacity stated by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the demonstrated 24-hour average firing rate shall be used to determine the annual capacity factor for the affected facility; otherwise, the maximum design heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer shall be used.
              (c) In place of PM testing with Method 5 or 5B of appendix A-3 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part, an owner or operator may elect to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring PM emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to continuously monitor PM emissions instead of conducting performance testing using Method 5 or 5B of appendix A-3 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS and shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(14) of this section.
              (1) Notify the Administrator 1 month before starting use of the system.
              (2) Notify the Administrator 1 month before stopping use of the system.
              (3) The monitor shall be installed, evaluated, and operated in accordance with § 60.13 of subpart A of this part.
              (4) The initial performance evaluation shall be completed no later than 180 days after the date of initial startup of the affected facility, as specified under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part or within 180 days of notification to the Administrator of use of CEMS if the owner or operator was previously determining compliance by Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part performance tests, whichever is later.
              (5) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test for PM emissions as required under § 60.8 of subpart A of this part. Compliance with the PM emission limit shall be determined by using the CEMS specified in paragraph (d) of this section to measure PM and calculating a 24-hour block arithmetic average emission concentration using EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A of this part, section 4.1.
              (6) Compliance with the PM emission limit shall be determined based on the 24-hour daily (block) average of the hourly arithmetic average emission concentrations using CEMS outlet data.
              (7) At a minimum, valid CEMS hourly averages shall be obtained as specified in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section for 75 percent of the total operating hours per 30-day rolling average.
              (i) At least two data points per hour shall be used to calculate each 1-hour arithmetic average.
              (ii) [Reserved]

              (8) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required under paragraph (c)(7) of this section shall be expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and shall be used to calculate the boiler operating day daily arithmetic average emission concentrations. The 1-hour arithmetic averages shall be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of this part.
              (9) All valid CEMS data shall be used in calculating average emission concentrations even if the minimum CEMS data requirements of paragraph (c)(7) of this section are not met.
              (10) The CEMS shall be operated according to Performance Specification 11 in appendix B of this part.

              (11) During the correlation testing runs of the CEMS required by Performance Specification 11 in appendix B of this part, PM and O2 (or CO2) data shall be collected concurrently (or within a 30- to 60-minute period) by both the continuous emission monitors and performance tests conducted using the following test methods.
              (i) For PM, Method 5 or 5B of appendix A-3 of this part or Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall be used; and
              (ii) For O2 (or CO2), Method 3A or 3B of appendix A-2 of this part, as applicable shall be used.

              [72 FR 32759, June 13, 2007, as amended at 74 FR 5091, Jan. 28, 2009; 76 FR 3523, Jan. 20, 2011; 77 FR 9463, Feb. 16, 2012]
            
            
              § 60.46c
              Emission monitoring for sulfur dioxide.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the SO2 emission limits under § 60.42c shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring SO2 concentrations and either O2 or CO2 concentrations at the outlet of the SO2 control device (or the outlet of the steam generating unit if no SO2 control device is used), and shall record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the percent reduction requirements under § 60.42c shall measure SO2 concentrations and either O2 or CO2 concentrations at both the inlet and outlet of the SO2 control device.
              (b) The 1-hour average SO2 emission rates measured by a CEMS shall be expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and shall be used to calculate the average emission rates under § 60.42c. Each 1-hour average SO2 emission rate must be based on at least 30 minutes of operation, and shall be calculated using the data points required under § 60.13(h)(2). Hourly SO2 emission rates are not calculated if the affected facility is operated less than 30 minutes in a 1-hour period and are not counted toward determination of a steam generating unit operating day.

              (c) The procedures under § 60.13 shall be followed for installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS.
              
              (1) All CEMS shall be operated in accordance with the applicable procedures under Performance Specifications 1, 2, and 3 of appendix B of this part.
              (2) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests shall be performed in accordance with Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part.

              (3) For affected facilities subject to the percent reduction requirements under § 60.42c, the span value of the SO2 CEMS at the inlet to the SO2 control device shall be 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO2 emission rate of the fuel combusted, and the span value of the SO2 CEMS at the outlet from the SO2 control device shall be 50 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO2 emission rate of the fuel combusted.

              (4) For affected facilities that are not subject to the percent reduction requirements of § 60.42c, the span value of the SO2 CEMS at the outlet from the SO2 control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if no SO2 control device is used) shall be 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO2 emission rate of the fuel combusted.

              (d) As an alternative to operating a CEMS at the inlet to the SO2 control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if no SO2 control device is used) as required under paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the average SO2 emission rate by sampling the fuel prior to combustion. As an alternative to operating a CEMS at the outlet from the SO2 control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if no SO2 control device is used) as required under paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the average SO2 emission rate by using Method 6B of appendix A of this part. Fuel sampling shall be conducted pursuant to either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. Method 6B of appendix A of this part shall be conducted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

              (1) For affected facilities combusting coal or oil, coal or oil samples shall be collected daily in an as-fired condition at the inlet to the steam generating unit and analyzed for sulfur content and heat content according the Method 19 of appendix A of this part. Method 19 of appendix A of this part provides procedures for converting these measurements into the format to be used in calculating the average SO2 input rate.
              (2) As an alternative fuel sampling procedure for affected facilities combusting oil, oil samples may be collected from the fuel tank for each steam generating unit immediately after the fuel tank is filled and before any oil is combusted. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall analyze the oil sample to determine the sulfur content of the oil. If a partially empty fuel tank is refilled, a new sample and analysis of the fuel in the tank would be required upon filling. Results of the fuel analysis taken after each new shipment of oil is received shall be used as the daily value when calculating the 30-day rolling average until the next shipment is received. If the fuel analysis shows that the sulfur content in the fuel tank is greater than 0.5 weight percent sulfur, the owner or operator shall ensure that the sulfur content of subsequent oil shipments is low enough to cause the 30-day rolling average sulfur content to be 0.5 weight percent sulfur or less.

              (3) Method 6B of appendix A of this part may be used in lieu of CEMS to measure SO2 at the inlet or outlet of the SO2 control system. An initial stratification test is required to verify the adequacy of the Method 6B of appendix A of this part sampling location. The stratification test shall consist of three paired runs of a suitable SO2 and CO2 measurement train operated at the candidate location and a second similar train operated according to the procedures in § 3.2 and the applicable procedures in section 7 of Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part. Method 6B of appendix A of this part, Method 6A of appendix A of this part, or a combination of Methods 6 and 3 of appendix A of this part or Methods 6C and 3A of appendix A of this part are suitable measurement techniques. If Method 6B of appendix A of this part is used for the second train, sampling time and timer operation may be adjusted for the stratification test as long as an adequate sample volume is collected; however, both sampling trains are to be operated similarly. For the location to be adequate for Method 6B of appendix A of this part 24-hour tests, the mean of the absolute difference between the three paired runs must be less than 10 percent (0.10).

              (e) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section shall not apply to affected facilities subject to § 60.42c(h) (1), (2), or (3) where the owner or operator of the affected facility seeks to demonstrate compliance with the SO2 standards based on fuel supplier certification, as described under § 60.48c(f), as applicable.
              (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility operating a CEMS pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or conducting as-fired fuel sampling pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall obtain emission data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours in at least 22 out of 30 successive steam generating unit operating days. If this minimum data requirement is not met with a single monitoring system, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall supplement the emission data with data collected with other monitoring systems as approved by the Administrator.
            
            
              § 60.47c
              Emission monitoring for particulate matter.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility combusting coal, oil, or wood that is subject to the opacity standards under § 60.43c shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) for measuring the opacity of the emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard in § 60.43c(c) that is not required to use a COMS due to paragraphs (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section that elects not to use a COMS shall conduct a performance test using Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limit in § 60.43c by April 29, 2011, within 45 days of stopping use of an existing COMS, or within 180 days after initial startup of the facility, whichever is later, and shall comply with either paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section. The observation period for Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests may be reduced from 3 hours to 60 minutes if all 6-minute averages are less than 10 percent and all individual 15-second observations are less than or equal to 20 percent during the initial 60 minutes of observation.
              (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests using the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section according to the applicable schedule in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of this section, as determined by the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test results.
              (i) If no visible emissions are observed, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 12 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later;
              (ii) If visible emissions are observed but the maximum 6-minute average opacity is less than or equal to 5 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 6 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later;
              (iii) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 5 percent but less than or equal to 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 3 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later; or

              (2) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

              (i) The owner or operator shall conduct 10 minute observations (during normal operation) each operating day the affected facility fires fuel for which an opacity standard is applicable using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part and demonstrate that the sum of the occurrences of any visible emissions is not in excess of 5 percent of the observation period (i.e. , 30 seconds per 10 minute period). If the sum of the occurrence of any visible emissions is greater than 30 seconds during the initial 10 minute observation, immediately conduct a 30 minute observation. If the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is greater than 5 percent of the observation period (i.e., 90 seconds per 30 minute period), the owner or operator shall either document and adjust the operation of the facility and demonstrate within 24 hours that the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is equal to or less than 5 percent during a 30 minute observation (i.e., 90 seconds) or conduct a new Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test using the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section within 45 calendar days according to the requirements in § 60.45c(a)(8).
              (ii) If no visible emissions are observed for 10 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable, observations can be reduced to once every 7 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable. If any visible emissions are observed, daily observations shall be resumed.
              (3) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 performance tests, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using a digital opacity compliance system according to a site-specific monitoring plan approved by the Administrator. The observations shall be similar, but not necessarily identical, to the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. For reference purposes in preparing the monitoring plan, see OAQPS “Determination of Visible Emission Opacity from Stationary Sources Using Computer-Based Photographic Analysis Systems.” This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality and Planning Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

              § 60.54
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).
              (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standard in § 60.52 as follows:
              (1) The concentration (c12) of particulate matter, corrected to 12 percent CO2, shall be computed for each run using the following equation:
              
              c12 = cs (12/%CO2)
              
              
                where:
                
                c12 = concentration of particulate matter, corrected to 12 percent CO2, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
                cs = concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
                %CO2 = CO2 concentration, percent dry basis.
              
              

              (2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration (cs). The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf).

              (3) The emission rate correction factor, integrated or grab sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine CO2 concentration (%CO2).
              (i) The CO2 sample shall be obtained simultaneously with, and at the same traverse points as, the particulate run. If the particulate run has more than 12 traverse points, the CO2 traverse points may be reduced to 12 if Method 1 is used to locate the 12 CO2 traverse points. If individual CO2 samples are taken at each traverse point, the CO2 concentration (%CO2) used in the correction equation shall be the arithmetic mean of the sample CO2 concentrations at all traverse points.

              (ii) If sampling is conducted after a wet scrubber, an “adjusted” CO2 concentration [(%CO2)adj], which accounts for the effects of CO2 absorption and dilution air, may be used instead of the CO2 concentration determined in this paragraph. The adjusted CO2 concentration shall be determined by either of the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.

              (c) The owner or operator may use either of the following procedures to determine the adjusted CO2 concentration.

              (1) The volumetric flow rates at the inlet and outlet of the wet scrubber and the inlet CO2 concentration may be used to determine the adjusted CO2
                concentration [(%CO2)adj] using the following equation:
              
              (%CO2)adj = (%CO2)di (Qdi/Qdo)
              
              
                where:
                
                (%CO2)adj = adjusted outlet CO2 concentration, percent dry basis.
                (%CO2)di = CO2 concentration measured before the scrubber, percent dry basis.
                Qdi = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas before the wet scrubber, dscm/min (dscf/min).
                Qdo = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas after the wet scrubber, dscm/min (dscf/min).
              
              

              (i) At the outlet, Method 5 is used to determine the volumetric flow rate (Qdo) of the effluent gas.

              (ii) At the inlet, Method 2 is used to determine the volumetric flow rate (Qdi) of the effluent gas as follows: Two full velocity traverses are conducted, one immediately before and one immediately after each particulate run conducted at the outlet, and the results are averaged.

              (iii) At the inlet, the emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B is used to determine the CO2 concentration [(%CO2)di] as follows: At least nine sampling points are selected randomly from the velocity traverse points and are divided randomly into three sets, equal in number of points; the first set of three or more points is used for the first run, the second set for the second run, and the third set for the third run. The CO2 sample is taken simultaneously with each particulate run being conducted at the outlet, by traversing the three sampling points (or more) and sampling at each point for equal increments of time.

              (2) Excess air measurements may be used to determine the adjusted CO2 concentration [(%CO2)adj] using the following equation:
              
              (%CO2)adj = (%CO2)di [(100 + %EAi)/(100 + %EAo)]
              
              
                where:
                
                (%CO2)adj = adjusted outlet CO2 concentration, percent dry basis.
                (%CO2)di = CO2 concentration at the inlet of the wet scrubber, percent dry basis.
                %EAi = excess air at the inlet of the scrubber, percent.
                %EAo = excess air at the outlet of the scrubber, percent.
              
              

              (i) A gas sample is collected as in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section and the gas samples at both the inlet and outlet locations are analyzed for CO2, O2, and N2.
              (ii) Equation 3B-3 of Method 3B is used to compute the percentages of excess air at the inlet and outlet of the wet scrubber.

This relationship may be reestablished during performance compliance tests.
              (i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B shall be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3, 3A, or 3B, or as an alternative ASME PTC-19-10-1981—part10, as applicable, shall be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor.
              (ii) Samples shall be taken for at least 30 minutes in each hour.
              (iii) Each sample shall represent a 1-hour average.
              (iv) A minimum of three runs shall be performed.
              (7) The relationship between carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations that is established in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) of this section shall be submitted to EPA as part of the initial performance test report and, if applicable, as part of the annual test report if the relationship is reestablished during the annual performance test.
              (8) During a loss of boiler water level control or loss of combustion air control malfunction period as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, a diluent cap of 14 percent for oxygen or 5 percent for carbon dioxide may be used in the emissions calculations for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(10) of this section, the procedures and test methods specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(11) of this section shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limits for particulate matter and opacity under § 60.52b(a)(1) and (a)(2).
              (1) The EPA Reference Method 1 shall be used to select sampling site and number of traverse points.
              (2) The EPA Reference Method 3, 3A or 3B, or as an alternative ASME PTC-19-10-1981—part10, as applicable, shall be used for gas analysis.
              (3) EPA Reference Method 5 shall be used for determining compliance with the particulate matter emission limit. The minimum sample volume shall be 1.7 cubic meters. The probe and filter holder heating systems in the sample train shall be set to provide a gas temperature no greater than 160 °C. An oxygen or carbon dioxide measurement shall be obtained simultaneously with each Method 5 run.
              (4) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that compliance with the particulate matter emission limit be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent oxygen.

              § 60.54c
              Siting requirements.
              (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility for which construction is commenced after September 15, 1997 shall prepare an analysis of the impacts of the affected facility. The analysis shall consider air pollution control alternatives that minimize, on a site-specific basis, to the maximum extent practicable, potential risks to public health or the environment. In considering such alternatives, the analysis may consider costs, energy impacts, non-air environmental impacts, or any other factors related to the practicability of the alternatives.
              (b) Analyses of facility impacts prepared to comply with State, local, or other Federal regulatory requirements may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section, as long as they include the consideration of air pollution control alternatives specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

              § 60.55c
              Waste management plan.

              The owner or operator of an affected facility shall prepare a waste management plan. The waste management plan shall identify both the feasibility and the approach to separate certain components of solid waste from the health care waste stream in order to reduce the amount of toxic emissions from incinerated waste. A waste management plan may include, but is not limited to, elements such as segregation and recycling of paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, batteries, food waste, and metals (e.g., aluminum cans, metals-containing devices); segregation of non-recyclable wastes (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyl-containing waste, pharmaceutical waste, and mercury-containing waste, such as dental waste); and purchasing recycled or recyclable products. A waste management plan may include different goals or approaches for different areas or departments of the facility and need not include new waste management goals for every waste stream. It should identify, where possible, reasonably available additional waste management measures, taking into account the effectiveness of waste management measures already in place, the costs of additional measures, the emissions reductions expected to be achieved, and any other environmental or energy impacts they might have. The American Hospital Association publication entitled “An Ounce of Prevention: Waste Reduction Strategies for Health Care Facilities” (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) shall be considered in the development of the waste management plan. The owner or operator of each commercial HMIWI company shall conduct training and education programs in waste segregation for each of the company's waste generator clients and ensure that each client prepares its own waste management plan that includes, but is not limited to, the provisions listed previously in this section.

              § 60.56c
              Compliance and performance testing.
              (a) The emissions limits apply at all times.
              (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(1) and (2), shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8 to determine compliance with the emissions limits using the procedures and test methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) and (b)(9) through (b)(14) of this section. The owner or operator of an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4), shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8 to determine compliance with the emissions limits using the procedures and test methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(14). The use of the bypass stack during a performance test shall invalidate the performance test.
              (1) All performance tests shall consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under representative operating conditions.
              (2) The minimum sample time shall be 1 hour per test run unless otherwise indicated.
              (3) EPA Reference Method 1 of appendix A of this part shall be used to select the sampling location and number of traverse points.

              (4) EPA Reference Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-2 of this part shall be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. EPA Reference Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-2 of this part shall be used simultaneously with each of the other EPA reference methods. As an alternative to EPA Reference Method 3B, ASME PTC-19-10-1981-Part 10 may be used (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17).

              (5) The pollutant concentrations shall be adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using the following equation:
              
              Cadj = Cmeas (20.9−7)/(20.9−%O2)
              
              
                where:
                
                Cadj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
                Cmeas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis (20.9−7) = 20.9 percent oxygen—7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis);
                20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
                %O2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
              
              
              (6) EPA Reference Method 5 of appendix A-3 or Method 26A or Method 29 of appendix A-8 of this part shall be used to measure the particulate matter emissions. As an alternative, PM CEMS may be used as specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

              (8) EPA Reference Method 6 or 6C of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to measure SO2 emissions.

              (9) EPA Reference Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to measure stack opacity. As an alternative, demonstration of compliance with the PM standards using bag leak detection systems as specified in § 60.57c(h) or PM CEMS as specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section is considered demonstrative of compliance with the opacity requirements.
              
              (10) EPA Reference Method 10 or 10B of appendix A-4 of this part shall be used to measure the CO emissions. As specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, use of CO CEMS are required for affected facilities under § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4).
              (11) EPA Reference Method 23 of appendix A-7 of this part shall be used to measure total dioxin/furan emissions. As an alternative, an owner or operator may elect to sample dioxins/furans by installing, calibrating, maintaining, and operating a continuous automated sampling system for monitoring dioxin/furan emissions as specified in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. For Method 23 of appendix A-7 sampling, the minimum sample time shall be 4 hours per test run. If the affected facility has selected the toxic equivalency standards for dioxins/furans, under § 60.52c, the following procedures shall be used to determine compliance:
              (i) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra-through octa-congener emitted using EPA Reference Method 23.
              (ii) For each dioxin/furan congener measured in accordance with paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section, multiply the congener concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in table 2 of this subpart.
              (iii) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
              (12) EPA Reference Method 26 or 26A of appendix A-8 of this part shall be used to measure HCl emissions. As an alternative, HCl CEMS may be used as specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.

              (13) EPA Reference Method 29 of appendix A-8 of this part shall be used to measure Pb, Cd, and Hg emissions. As an alternative, Hg emissions may be measured using ASTM D6784-02 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). As an alternative for Pb, Cd, and Hg, multi-metals CEMS or Hg CEMS, may be used as specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. As an alternative, an owner or operator may elect to sample Hg by installing, calibrating, maintaining, and operating a continuous automated sampling system for monitoring Hg emissions as specified in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
              (14) The EPA Reference Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part shall be used to determine compliance with the fugitive ash emissions limit under § 60.52c(c). The minimum observation time shall be a series of three 1-hour observations.
              (c) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall:
              (1) Determine compliance with the opacity limit by conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section, determine compliance with the PM, CO, and HCl emissions limits by conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If all three performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the emissions limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), the owner or operator may forego a performance test for that pollutant for the subsequent 2 years. At a minimum, a performance test for PM, CO, and HCl shall be conducted every third year (no more than 36 months following the previous performance test). If a performance test conducted every third year indicates compliance with the emissions limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), the owner or operator may forego a performance test for that pollutant for an additional 2 years. If any performance test indicates noncompliance with the respective emissions limit, a performance test for that pollutant shall be conducted annually until all annual performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the emissions limit. The use of the bypass stack during a performance test shall invalidate the performance test.

              (3) For an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(1) and (2) and utilizing a large HMIWI, and in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4), determine compliance with the visible emissions limits for fugitive emissions from flyash/bottom ash storage and handling by conducting a performance test using EPA Reference Method 22 of appendix A-7 on an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test).
              (4) For an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4), determine compliance with the CO emissions limit using a CO CEMS according to paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(4)(iii) of this section:
              (i) Determine compliance with the CO emissions limit using a 24-hour block average, calculated as specified in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.
              (ii) Operate the CO CEMS in accordance with the applicable procedures under appendices B and F of this part.
              (iii) Use of a CO CEMS may be substituted for the CO annual performance test and minimum secondary chamber temperature to demonstrate compliance with the CO emissions limit.
              (5) Facilities using CEMS to demonstrate compliance with any of the emissions limits under § 60.52c shall:
              (i) For an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(1) and (2), determine compliance with the appropriate emissions limit(s) using a 12-hour rolling average, calculated each hour as the average of the previous 12 operating hours.
              (ii) For an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4), determine compliance with the appropriate emissions limit(s) using a 24-hour block average, calculated as specified in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.

              (iii) Operate all CEMS in accordance with the applicable procedures under appendices B and F of this part. For those CEMS for which performance specifications have not yet been promulgated (HCl, multi-metals), this option for an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4) takes effect on the date a final performance specification is published in the Federal Register or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan.
              (iv) For an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4), be allowed to substitute use of an HCl CEMS for the HCl annual performance test, minimum HCl sorbent flow rate, and minimum scrubber liquor pH to demonstrate compliance with the HCl emissions limit.
              (v) For an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4), be allowed to substitute use of a PM CEMS for the PM annual performance test and minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, if applicable, to demonstrate compliance with the PM emissions limit.

              (6) An affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4) using a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan emissions limits under § 60.52c shall record the output of the system and analyze the sample according to EPA Reference Method 23 of appendix A-7 of this part. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to dioxin/furan from monitors is published in the Federal Register or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan. The owner or operator of an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4) who elects to continuously sample dioxin/furan emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Reference Method 23 of appendix A-7 shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous automated sampling system and shall comply with the requirements specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q) of subpart Eb of this part.

              (7) An affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4) using a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with the Hg emissions limits under § 60.52c shall record the output of the system and analyze the sample at set intervals using any suitable determinative technique that can meet appropriate performance criteria. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to Hg from monitors is published in the Federal Register or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan. The owner or operator of an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4) who elects to continuously sample Hg emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Reference Method 29 of appendix A-8 of this part, or an approved alternative method for measuring Hg emissions, shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous automated sampling system and shall comply with the requirements specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q) of subpart Eb of this part.
              (d) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(7) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility equipped with a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter, a wet scrubber, or a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter and wet scrubber shall:
              (1) Establish the appropriate maximum and minimum operating parameters, indicated in table 3 of this subpart for each control system, as site specific operating parameters during the initial performance test to determine compliance with the emission limits; and
              (2) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, ensure that the affected facility does not operate above any of the applicable maximum operating parameters or below any of the applicable minimum operating parameters listed in table 3 of this subpart and measured as 3-hour rolling averages (calculated each hour as the average of the previous 3 operating hours) at all times. Operating parameter limits do not apply during performance tests. Operation above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating parameter(s) shall constitute a violation of established operating parameter(s).
              (e) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, for affected facilities equipped with a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter:

              (2) Operation of the affected facility above the maximum fabric filter inlet temperature, above the maximum charge rate, and below the minimum dioxin/furan sorbent flow rate (each measured on a 3-hour rolling average) simultaneously shall constitute a violation of the dioxin/furan emission limit.
              (3) Operation of the affected facility above the maximum charge rate and below the minimum HCl sorbent flow rate (each measured on a 3-hour rolling average) simultaneously shall constitute a violation of the HCl emission limit.
              (4) Operation of the affected facility above the maximum charge rate and below the minimum Hg sorbent flow rate (each measured on a 3-hour rolling average) simultaneously shall constitute a violation of the Hg emission limit.
              (5) Use of the bypass stack shall constitute a violation of the PM, dioxin/furan, HCl, Pb, Cd and Hg emissions limits.
              (6) Operation of the affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4) above the CO emissions limit as measured by the CO CEMS specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall constitute a violation of the CO emissions limit.
              (7) For an affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4), failure to initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection system alarm; or failure to operate and maintain the fabric filter such that the alarm is not engaged for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period shall constitute a violation of the PM emissions limit. If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action. If the bag leak detection system is used to demonstrate compliance with the opacity limit, this would also constitute a violation of the opacity emissions limit.

              (8) Operation of the affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4) above the PM, HCl, Pb, Cd, and/or Hg emissions limit as measured by the CEMS specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section shall constitute a violation of the applicable emissions limit.

If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action. If the bag leak detection system is used to demonstrate compliance with the opacity limit, this would also constitute a violation of the opacity emissions limit.
              (8) Operation of the affected facility as defined in § 60.50c(a)(3) and (4) above the PM, HCl, Pb, Cd, and/or Hg emissions limit as measured by the CEMS specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section shall constitute a violation of the applicable emissions limit.

              (1) Each triboelectric bag leak detection system may be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained according to the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D-243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emissions Measurement Center Continuous Emissions Monitoring. Other types of bag leak detection systems shall be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.
              (2) The bag leak detection system shall be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
              (3) The bag leak detection system sensor shall provide an output of relative PM loadings.
              (4) The bag leak detection system shall be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.
              (5) The bag leak detection system shall be equipped with an audible alarm system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative PM emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm shall be located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.
              (6) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detector shall be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.
              (7) For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector shall be installed downstream of the fabric filter.
              (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
              (9) The baseline output shall be established by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance.”
              (10) Following initial adjustment of the system, the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time may not be adjusted. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete fabric filter inspection that demonstrates that the fabric filter is in good operating condition. Each adjustment shall be recorded.
              (11) Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.

              (12) Initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection system alarm; operate and maintain the fabric filter such that the alarm is not engaged for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period. If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.

              § 60.61
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.
              (a) Portland cement plant means any facility manufacturing portland cement by either the wet or dry process.
              (b) Bypass means any system that prevents all or a portion of the kiln or clinker cooler exhaust gases from entering the main control device and ducts the gases through a separate control device. This does not include emergency systems designed to duct exhaust gases directly to the atmosphere in the event of a malfunction of any control device controlling kiln or clinker cooler emissions.
              (c) Bypass stack means the stack that vents exhaust gases to the atmosphere from the bypass control device.
              (d) Monovent means an exhaust configuration of a building or emission control device (e.g., positive-pressure fabric filter) that extends the length of the structure and has a width very small in relation to its length (i.e., length to width ratio is typically greater than 5:1). The exhaust may be an open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a combination of such features.
              
              (e) Excess emissions means, with respect to this subpart, results of any required measurements outside the applicable range (e.g., emissions limitations, parametric operating limits) that is permitted by this subpart. The values of measurements will be in the same units and averaging time as the values specified in this subpart for the limitations.
              (f) Operating day means a 24-hour period beginning at 12:00 midnight during which the kiln produces clinker at any time. For calculating 30 day rolling average emissions, an operating day does not include the hours of operation during startup or shutdown.
              (g) Rolling average means the weighted average of all data, meeting QA/QC requirements or otherwise normalized, collected during the applicable averaging period. The period of a rolling average stipulates the frequency of data averaging and reporting. To demonstrate compliance with an operating parameter a 30-day rolling average period requires calculation of a new average value each operating day and shall include the average of all the hourly averages of the specific operating parameter. For demonstration of compliance with an emissions limit based on pollutant concentration, a 30-day rolling average is comprised of the average of all the hourly average concentrations over the previous 30 operating days. For demonstration of compliance with an emissions limit based on lbs-pollutant per production unit, the 30-day rolling average is calculated by summing the hourly mass emissions over the previous 30 operating days, then dividing that sum by the total production during the same period.
              (h) Run average means the average of the recorded parameter values for a run.

              § 60.62
              Standards.
              (a) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, you may not discharge into the atmosphere from any kiln any gases which:
              (1) Contain particulate matter (PM) in excess of:
              (i) 0.30 pounds per ton of feed (dry basis) to the kiln for kilns constructed, reconstructed, or modified after August 17, 1971 but on or before June 16, 2008.
              (ii) 0.02 pound per ton of clinker if construction or reconstruction of the kiln commenced after June 16, 2008.
              (iii) Kilns that have undergone a modification may not discharge into the atmosphere any gases which contain PM in excess of 0.07 pound per ton of clinker.
              (2) Exhibit greater than 20 percent opacity for kilns constructed, reconstructed, or modified after August 17, 1971 but on or before June 16, 2008, except that this opacity limit does not apply to any kiln subject to a PM limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that uses a PM continuous parametric monitoring system (CPMS).
              (3) Exceed 1.50 pounds of nitrogen oxide (NOX) per ton of clinker on a 30-operating day rolling average if construction, reconstruction, or modification of the kiln commences after June 16, 2008, except this limit does not apply to any alkali bypass installed on the kiln. An operating day includes all valid data obtained in any daily 24-hour period during which the kiln operates and excludes any measurements made during the daily 24-hour period when the kiln was not operating.
              (4) Exceed 0.4 pounds of sulfur dioxide (SO2) per ton of clinker on a 30-operating day rolling average if construction, reconstruction, or modification commences after June 16, 2008, unless you are demonstrating a 90 percent SO2 emissions reduction measured across the SO2 control device. An operating day includes all valid data obtained in any daily 24-hour period during which the kiln operates, and excludes any measurements made during the daily 24-hour period when the kiln was not operating.
              (b) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, you may not discharge into the atmosphere from any clinker cooler any gases which:
              (1) Contain PM in excess of:
              
              (i) 0.02 pound per ton of clinker if construction or reconstruction of the clinker cooler commences after June 16, 2008.
              (ii) 0.07 pound per ton of clinker if the clinker cooler has undergone a modification.
              (iii) 0.10 lb per ton of feed (dry basis) for clinker coolers constructed, reconstructed, or modified after August 17, 1971, but on or before June 16, 2008.
              (iv) 10 percent opacity for clinker coolers constructed, reconstructed, or modified after August 17, 1971, but on or before June 16, 2008, except that this opacity limit does not apply to any clinker cooler subject to a PM limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that uses a PM continuous parametric monitoring system (CPMS).
              (2) If the kiln and clinker cooler exhaust are combined for energy efficiency purposes and sent to a single control device, the appropriate kiln PM limit may be adjusted using the procedures in § 63.1343(b) of this chapter.
              (3) If the kiln has a separated alkali bypass stack and/or an inline coal mill with a separate stack, you must combine the PM emissions from the bypass stack and/or the inline coal mill stack with the PM emissions from the main kiln exhaust to determine total PM emissions.
              (c) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, you may not discharge into the atmosphere from any affected facility other than the kiln and clinker cooler any gases which exhibit 10 percent opacity, or greater.
              (d) If you have an affected source subject to this subpart with a different emissions limit or requirement for the same pollutant under another regulation in title 40 of this chapter, once you are in compliance with the most stringent emissions limit or requirement, you are not subject to the less stringent requirement. Until you are in compliance with the more stringent limit, the less stringent limit continues to apply.
              (e) The compliance date for all revised monitoring and recordkeeping requirements contained in this rule will be the same as listed in 63.1351(c) unless you commenced construction as of June 16, 2008, at which time the compliance date is November 8, 2010 or upon startup, whichever is later.

              § 60.63
              Monitoring of operations.
              (a) [Reserved]
              (b) Clinker production monitoring requirements. For any kiln subject to an emissions limitation on PM, NOX, or SO2 emissions (lb/ton of clinker), you must:
              (1) Determine hourly clinker production by one of two methods:
              (i) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates of the amount of clinker produced in tons of mass per hour. The system of measuring hourly clinker production must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy or
              (ii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates of the amount of feed to the kiln in tons of mass per hour. The system of measuring feed must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy. Calculate your hourly clinker production rate using a kiln specific feed-to-clinker ratio based on reconciled clinker production rates determined for accounting purposes and recorded feed rates. This ratio should be updated monthly. Note that if this ratio changes at clinker reconciliation, you must use the new ratio going forward, but you do not have to retroactively change clinker production rates previously estimated.
              (iii) For each kiln operating hour for which you do not have data on clinker production or the amount of feed to the kiln, use the value from the most recent previous hour for which valid data are available.

              (2) Determine, record, and maintain a record of the accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production rates or feed rates before initial use (for new sources) or by the effective compliance date of this rule (for existing sources). During each quarter of source operation, you must determine, record, and maintain a record of the ongoing accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production rates or feed rates.
              (3) If you measure clinker production directly, record the daily clinker production rates; if you measure the kiln feed rates and calculate clinker production, record the daily kiln feed and clinker production rates.
              (c) PM Emissions Monitoring Requirements. (1) For each kiln or clinker cooler subject to a PM emissions limit in §§ 60.62(a)1(ii) and 60.62(a)1(iii) or §§ 60.62(b)(1)(i) and 60.62(b)(1)(ii), you must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test. You will conduct your performance test using Method 5 or Method 5I at appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter. You must also monitor continuous performance through use of a PM CPMS.
              (2) For your PM CPMS, you will establish a site-specific operating limit. If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit equivalent to 75 percent of the standard. If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test demonstrating compliance with the PM limit to establish your operating limit. You will use the PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous compliance with your operating limit. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.
              (i) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp or digital signal output and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps or the monitors digital equivalent.
              (ii) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit.

              (iii) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp or digital output values from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (e.g., average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour Method 5I test runs).
              (3) Determine your operating limit as specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(5) of this section. If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit, you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp or digital equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit, you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test to establish your operating limit. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test. You must repeat the performance test at least annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.
              (4) If the average of your three Method 5 or 5I compliance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or 5I compliance test with the procedures in (c)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.

              (i) Determine your PM CPMS instrument zero output with one of the following procedures.
              
              (A) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.
              (B) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.
              (C) The zero point can also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept.
              (D) If none of the steps in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (C) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.
              (ii) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps or digital equivalent and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 1.

                R = The relative lb/ton clinker per milliamp or digital equivalent for your PM CPMS.
                Y1 = The three run average PM lb/ton clinker.
                X1 = The three run average milliamp or digital signal output from your PM CPMS.
                z = The milliamp or digital equivalent of your instrument zero determined from (c)(4)(i) of this section.
              
              
              (iv) Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating limit using the lb/ton-clinker per milliamp or digital signal value from Equation 2 above in Equation 3, below. This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of your emission limit.

                Ol = The operating limit for your PM CPMS on a 30-day rolling average, in milliamps or the digital equivalent.
                
                L = Your source emission limit expressed in lb/ton clinker.
                z = Your instrument zero in milliamps or a digital equivalent, determined from (1)(i).
                R = The relative lb/ton-clinker per milliamp or digital equivalent, for your PM CPMS, from Equation 2.
              
              
              (5) If the average of your three PM compliance test runs is at or above 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must determine your operating limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp or digital equivalent output corresponding to your three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using Equation 4.
              
                ER27JY15.009

                n = The number of data points.
                Oh = Your site specific operating limit, in milliamps or digital equivalent.
              
              
              (6) To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating, and use all the PM CPMS data for calculations when the source is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (milliamps or the digital equivalent) on a 30 operating day rolling average basis, updated at the end of each new kiln operating day. Use Equation 5 to determine the 30 kiln operating day average.

                Hpvi = The hourly parameter value for hour i.
                n = The number of valid hourly parameter values collected over the previous 30 kiln operating days.
              
              
              (7) Use EPA Method 5 or Method 5I of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to determine PM emissions. For each performance test, conduct at least three separate runs each while the mill is on and the mill is off under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating at the level reasonably expected to occur. Conduct each test run to collect a minimum sample volume of 2 dscm for determining compliance with a new source limit and 1 dscm for determining compliance with an existing source limit. Calculate the time weighted average of the results from three consecutive runs to determine compliance. You need not determine the particulate matter collected in the impingers (“back half”) of the Method 5 or Method 5I particulate sampling train to demonstrate compliance with the PM standards of this subpart. This shall not preclude the permitting authority from requiring a determination of the “back half” for other purposes.

              (8) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (e.g. beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp or digital signal value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp or digital equivalent signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.

              (d) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a CEMS continuously monitoring and recording the concentration by volume of NOX emissions into the atmosphere for any kiln subject to the NOX emissions limit in § 60.62(a)(3). If the kiln has an alkali bypass, NOX emissions from the alkali bypass do not need to be monitored, and NOX emission monitoring of the kiln exhaust may be done upstream of any commingled alkali bypass gases.

              (e) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a CEMS for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration by volume of SO2 emissions into the atmosphere for any kiln subject to the SO2 emissions limit in § 60.62(a)(4). If you are complying with the alternative 90 percent SO2 emissions reduction emissions limit, you must also continuously monitor and record the concentration by volume of SO2 present at the wet scrubber inlet.
              (f) The NOX and SO2 CEMS required under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section must be installed, operated and maintained according to Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part and the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (1) The span value of each NOX CEMS monitor must be set at 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential NOX emission concentration that translates to the applicable emissions limit at full clinker production capacity.

              (2) You must conduct performance evaluations of each NOX CEMS monitor according to the requirements in § 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part. You must use Methods 7, 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E of appendix A-4 to this part for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to Method 7 or 7C of appendix A-4 to this part.
              (3) The span value for the SO2 CEMS monitor is the SO2 emission concentration that corresponds to 125 percent of the applicable emissions limit at full clinker production capacity and the expected maximum fuel sulfur content.

              (4) You must conduct performance evaluations of each SO2 CEMS monitor according to the requirements in § 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part. You must use Methods 6, 6A, or 6C of appendix A-4 to this part for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to Method 6 or 6A of appendix A-4 to this part.

              (5) You must comply with the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of appendix F to this part for each NOX and SO2 CEMS, including quarterly accuracy determinations for monitors, and daily calibration drift tests.
              (g) For each CPMS or CEMS required under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section:
              (1) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected source is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).
              (2) You may not use data recorded during the monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. An owner or operator must use all the data collected during all other periods in reporting emissions or operating levels.

              (3) You must meet the requirements of § 60.13(h) when determining the 1-hour averages of emissions data.
              

              (h) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain instruments for continuously measuring and recording the stack gas flow rate to allow determination of the pollutant mass emissions rate to the atmosphere for each kiln subject to the PM emissions limits in § 60.62(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) and (b)(1)(i) and (ii), the NOX emissions limit in § 60.62(a)(3), or the SO2 emissions limit in § 60.62(a)(4) according to the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1) through (10), where appropriate, of this section.

              (1) The owner or operator must install each sensor of the flow rate monitoring system in a location that provides representative measurement of the exhaust gas flow rate at the sampling location of the NOX and/or SO2 CEMS, taking into account the manufacturer's recommendations. The flow rate sensor is that portion of the system that senses the volumetric flow rate and generates an output proportional to that flow rate.
              (2) The flow rate monitoring system must be designed to measure the exhaust gas flow rate over a range that extends from a value of at least 20 percent less than the lowest expected exhaust flow rate to a value of at least 20 percent greater than the highest expected exhaust gas flow rate.
              (3) The flow rate monitoring system must have a minimum accuracy of 5 percent of the flow rate.
              (4) The flow rate monitoring system must be equipped with a data acquisition and recording system that is capable of recording values over the entire range specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

                K = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (1.0 lb/lb).
              
              
              (2) Method 7 shall be used to determine the NOX concentration of each grab sample. Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site, and the sampling point shall be the centroid of the stack or duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m (3.28 ft). Four grab samples shall be taken at approximately 15-minute intervals. The arithmetic mean of the four sample concentrations shall constitute the run value (Cs).

              Emissions testing and monitoring.
              (a) General emissions monitoring requirements. You must install and operate a NOX concentration (ppmv) continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS). You must also install and operate a stack gas flow rate monitoring system. With measurements of stack gas NOX concentration and stack gas flow rate, you will determine hourly NOX emissions rate (e.g., lb/hr) and with measured data of the hourly nitric acid production (tons), calculate emissions in units of the applicable emissions limit (lb/ton of 100 percent acid produced). You must operate the monitoring system and report emissions during all operating periods including unit startup and shutdown, and malfunction.
              (b) Nitrogen oxides concentration continuous emissions monitoring system. (1) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring and recording the concentration of NOX emissions in accordance with the provisions of § 60.13 and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B and Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part. You must use cylinder gas audits to fulfill the quarterly auditing requirement at section 5.1 of Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part for the NOX concentration CEMS.
              (2) For the NOX concentration CEMS, use a span value, as defined in Performance Specification 2, section 3.11, of appendix B of this part, of 500 ppmv (as NO2). If you emit NOX at concentrations higher than 600 ppmv (e.g., during startup or shutdown periods), you must apply a second CEMS or dual range CEMS and a second span value equal to 125 percent of the maximum estimated NOX emission concentration to apply to the second CEMS or to the higher of the dual analyzer ranges during such periods.
              (3) For conducting the relative accuracy test audits, per Performance Specification 2, section 8.4, of appendix B of this part and Procedure 1, section 5.1.1, of appendix F of this part, use either EPA Reference Method 7, 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E of appendix A-4 of this part; EPA Reference Method 320 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter; or ASTM D6348-03 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). To verify the operation of the second CEMS or the higher range of a dual analyzer CEMS described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you need not conduct a relative accuracy test audit but only the calibration drift test initially (found in Performance Specification 2, section 8.3.1, of appendix B of this part) and the cylinder gas audit thereafter (found in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2, of appendix F of this part).

              (4) If you use EPA Reference Method 7E of appendix A-4 of this part, you must mitigate loss of NO2 in water according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section and verify performance by conducting the system bias checks required in EPA Reference Method 7E, section 8, of appendix A-4 of this part according to (b)(4)(iv) of this section, or follow the dynamic spike procedure according to paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section.
              (i) For a wet-basis measurement system, you must measure and report temperature of sample line and components (up to analyzer inlet) to demonstrate that the temperatures remain above the sample gas dew point at all times during the sampling.
              (ii) You may use a dilution probe to reduce the dew point of the sample gas.
              (iii) You may use a refrigerated-type condenser or similar device (e.g., permeation dryer) to remove condensate continuously from sample gas while maintaining minimal contact between condensate and sample gas.

              (iv) If your analyzer measures nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) separately, you must use both NO and NO2 calibration gases. Otherwise, you must substitute NO2 calibration gas for NO calibration gas in the performance of system bias checks.

              (v) You must conduct dynamic spiking according to EPA Reference Method 7E, section 16.1, of appendix A-4 of this part using NO2 as the spike gas.
              (5) Instead of a NOX concentration CEMS meeting Performance Specification 2, you may apply an FTIR CEMS meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 15 of appendix B of this part to measure NOX concentrations. Should you use an FTIR CEMS, you must replace the Relative Accuracy Test Audit requirements of Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part with the validation requirements and criteria of Performance Specification 15, sections 11.1.1 and 12.0, of appendix B of this part.
              (c) Determining NO
                X
                mass emissions rate values. You must use the NOX concentration CEMS, acid production, gas flow rate monitor and other monitoring data to calculate emissions data in units of the applicable limit (lb NOX/ton of acid produced expressed as 100 percent nitric acid).

              (1) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring and recording the stack gas flow rates to use in combination with data from the CEMS for measuring emissions concentrations of NOX to produce data in units of mass rate (e.g., lb/hr) of NOX on an hourly basis. You will operate and certify the continuous emissions rate monitoring system (CERMS) in accordance with the provisions of § 60.13 and Performance Specification 6 of appendix B of this part. You must comply with the following provisions in (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
              (i) You must use a stack gas flow rate sensor with a full scale output of at least 125 percent of the maximum expected exhaust volumetric flow rate (see Performance Specification 6, section 8, of appendix B of this part).

              (ii) For conducting the relative accuracy test audits, per Performance Specification 6, section 8.2 of appendix B of this part and Procedure 1, section 5.1.1, of appendix F of this part, you must use either EPA Reference Method 2, 2F, or 2G of appendix A-4 of this part. You may also apply Method 2H in conjunction with other velocity measurements.
              
              (iii) You must verify that the CERMS complies with the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part. You must conduct relative accuracy testing to provide for calculating the relative accuracy for RATA and RAA determinations in units of lb/hour.
              (2) You must determine the nitric acid production parameters (production rate and concentration) by installing, calibrating, maintaining, and operating a permanent monitoring system (e.g., weigh scale, volume flow meter, mass flow meter, tank volume) to measure and record the weight rates of nitric acid produced in tons per hour. If your nitric acid production rate measurements are for periods longer than hourly (e.g., daily values), you will determine average hourly production values, tons acid/hr, by dividing the total acid production by the number of hours of process operation for the subject measurement period. You must comply with the following provisions in (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.
              (i) You must verify that each component of the monitoring system has an accuracy and precision of no more than ±5 percent of full scale.
              (ii) You must analyze product concentration via titration or by determining the temperature and specific gravity of the nitric acid. You may also use ASTM E1584-11 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), for determining the concentration of nitric acid in percent. You must determine product concentration daily.
              (iii) You must use the acid concentration to express the nitric acid production as 100 percent nitric acid.
              (iv) You must record the nitric acid production, expressed as 100 percent nitric acid, and the hours of operation.
              (3) You must calculate hourly NOX emissions rates in units of the standard (lb/ton acid) for each hour of process operation. For process operating periods for which there is little or no acid production (e.g., startup or shutdown), you must use the average hourly acid production rate determined from the data collected over the previous 30 days of normal acid production periods (see § 60.75a).
              (d) Continuous monitoring system. For each continuous monitoring system, including NOX concentration measurement, volumetric flow rate measurement, and nitric acid production measurement equipment, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected facility is operating except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods as defined in appendix F, sections 4 and 5, of this part, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments.
              (2) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating emissions and the status of compliance with the applicable emissions limit in accordance with § 60.72a(a).
              (e) Initial performance testing. You must conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the NOX emissions limit under § 60.72a(a) beginning in the calendar month following initial certification of the NOX and flow rate monitoring CEMS. The initial performance test consists of collection of hourly NOX average concentration, mass flow rate recorded with the certified NOX concentration and flow rate CEMS and the corresponding acid generation (tons) data for all of the hours of operation for the first 30 days beginning on the first day of the first month following completion of the CEMS installation and certification as described above. You must assure that the CERMS meets all of the data quality assurance requirements as per § 60.13 and appendix F, Procedure 1, of this part and you must use the data from the CERMS for this compliance determination.
            
            
              
              § 60.74a
              Affirmative defense for violations of emission standards during malfunction.
              In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in § 60.72a, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at 40 CFR 60.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (a) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, you must timely meet the reporting requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (1) The violation:
              (i) Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
              (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
              (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
              (iv) Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
              (3) The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and
              (4) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
              (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
              (6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
              (7) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              (8) At all times, the affected facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (b) Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.
            
            
              § 60.75a

                Ci = concentration of NOX for hour i, ppmv;
                Qi = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas for hour i, where Ci and Qi are on the same basis (either wet or dry), scf/hr;
                Pi = total acid produced during production hour i, tons 100 percent HNO3;
                k = conversion factor, 1.194 × 10−7 for NOX; and
                n = number of operating hours in the 30 operating day period, i.e., n is between 30 and 720.

              § 60.84
              Emission monitoring.

              (a) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of sulfur dioxide shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the owner or operator. The pollutant gas used to prepare calibration gas mixtures under Performance Specification 2 and for calibration checks under § 60.13(d), shall be sulfur dioxide (SO2). Method 8 shall be used for conducting monitoring system performance evaluations under § 60.13(c) except that only the sulfur dioxide portion of the Method 8 results shall be used. The span value shall be set at 1000 ppm of sulfur dioxide.

              (b) The owner or operator shall establish a conversion factor for the purpose of converting monitoring data into units of the applicable standard (kg/metric ton, lb/ton). The conversion factor shall be determined, as a minimum, three times daily by measuring the concentration of sulfur dioxide entering the converter using suitable methods (e.g., the Reich test, National Air Pollution Control Administration Publication No. 999-AP-13) and calculating the appropriate conversion factor for each eight-hour period as follows:
              
              CF = k[(1.000−0.015r)/(r−s)]
              
              
                where:
                
                CF = conversion factor (kg/metric ton per ppm, lb/ton per ppm).
                k = constant derived from material balance. For determining CF in metric units, k = 0.0653. For determining CF in English units, k = 0.1306.
                r = percentage of sulfur dioxide by volume entering the gas converter. Appropriate corrections must be made for air injection plants subject to the Administrator's approval.
                s = percentage of sulfur dioxide by volume in the emissions to the atmosphere determined by the continuous monitoring system required under paragraph (a) of this section.
              
              
              (c) The owner or operator shall record all conversion factors and values under paragraph (b) of this section from which they were computed (i.e., CF, r, and s).

              (d) Alternatively, a source that processes elemental sulfur or an ore that contains elemental sulfur and uses air to supply oxygen may use the following continuous emission monitoring approach and calculation procedures in determining SO2 emission rates in terms of the standard. This procedure is not required, but is an alternative that would alleviate problems encountered in the measurement of gas velocities or production rate. Continuous emission monitoring systems for measuring SO2, O2, and CO2 (if required) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the owner or operator and subjected to the certification procedures in Performance Specifications 2 and 3. The calibration procedure and span value for the SO2 monitor shall be as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The span value for CO2 (if required) shall be 10 percent and for O2 shall be 20.9 percent (air). A conversion factor based on process rate data is not necessary. Calculate the SO2 emission rate as follows:
              
              Es = (Cs S)/[0.265 − (0.0126 %O2) − (A %CO2)]
              
              
                where:
                
                Es = emission rate of SO2, kg/metric ton (lb/ton) of 100 percent of H2SO4 produced.
                Cs = concentration of SO2, kg/dscm (lb/dscf).

                S = acid production rate factor, 368 dscm/metric ton (11,800 dscf/ton) of 100 percent H2SO4 produced.
                %O2 = oxygen concentration, percent dry basis.
                A = auxiliary fuel factor,
                 = 0.00 for no fuel.
                 = 0.0226 for methane.
                 = 0.0217 for natural gas.
                
                 = 0.0196 for propane.
                 = 0.0172 for No 2 oil.
                 = 0.0161 for No 6 oil.
                 = 0.0148 for coal.
                 = 0.0126 for coke.

The relative accuracy limit shall be 20 percent or 4 ppm, whichever is greater, and the calibration drift limit shall be 5 percent of the established span value.

              (iv) Fuel gas combustion devices having a common source of fuel gas may be monitored at only one location (i.e., after one of the combustion devices), if monitoring at this location accurately represents the SO2 emissions into the atmosphere from each of the combustion devices.
              (4) Instead of the SO2 monitor in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for fuel gas combustion devices subject to § 60.104(a)(1), an instrument for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration (dry basis) of H2S in fuel gases before being burned in any fuel gas combustion device.

              (ii) Fuel gas combustion devices having a common source of fuel gas may be monitored at only one location, if monitoring at this location accurately represents the concentration of H2S in the fuel gas being burned.
              (iii) The performance evaluations for this H2S monitor under § 60.13(c) shall use Performance Specification 7. Method 11, 15, 15A, or 16 shall be used for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations.
              (iv) The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device is not required to comply with paragraph (a)(3) or (4) of this section for fuel gas streams that are exempt under § 60.104(a)(1) and fuel gas streams combusted in a fuel gas combustion device that are inherently low in sulfur content. Fuel gas streams meeting one of the requirements in paragraphs (a)(4)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section will be considered inherently low in sulfur content. If the composition of a fuel gas stream changes such that it is no longer exempt under § 60.104(a)(1) or it no longer meets one of the requirements in paragraphs (a)(4)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section, the owner or operator must begin continuous monitoring under paragraph (a)(3) or (4) of this section within 15 days of the change.

Methods 15 or 15A and Method 3 shall be used for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. If Method 3 yields O2 concentrations below 0.25 percent during the performance specification test, the O2 concentration may be assumed to be zero and the reduced sulfur CEMS need not include an O2 monitor.

              (7) In place of the reduced sulfur monitor under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, an instrument using an air or O2 dilution and oxidation system to convert the reduced sulfur to SO2 for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration (dry basis, zero percent excess air) of the resultant SO2. The monitor shall include an oxygen monitor for correcting the data for excess oxygen.
              (i) The span values for this monitor are 375 ppm SO2 and 25 percent O2.

The span of this continuous monitoring system shall be set at 10 percent.

              (11) The continuous monitoring systems under paragraphs (a)(8), (a)(9), and (a)(10) of this section are operated and data recorded during all periods of operation of the affected facility including periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, except for continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments.

              (13) When seeking to comply with § 60.104(b)(1), when emission data are not obtained because of continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks and zero and span adjustments, emission data will be obtained by using one of the following methods to provide emission data for a minimum of 18 hours per day in at least 22 out of 30 rolling successive calendar days.
              (i) The test methods as described in § 60.106(k);
              (ii) A spare continuous monitoring system; or
              (iii) Other monitoring systems as approved by the Administrator.
              (b) An owner or operator may demonstrate that a fuel gas stream combusted in a fuel gas combustion device subject to § 60.104(a)(1) that is not specifically exempted in § 60.105(a)(4)(iv) is inherently low in sulfur. A fuel gas stream that is determined to be low-sulfur is exempt from the monitoring requirements in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section until there are changes in operating conditions or stream composition.
              (1) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a written application for an exemption from monitoring. The application must contain the following information:
              (i) A description of the fuel gas stream/system to be considered, including submission of a portion of the appropriate piping diagrams indicating the boundaries of the fuel gas stream/system, and the affected fuel gas combustion device(s) to be considered;

              (ii) A statement that there are no crossover or entry points for sour gas (high H2S content) to be introduced into the fuel gas stream/system (this should be shown in the piping diagrams);
              (iii) An explanation of the conditions that ensure low amounts of sulfur in the fuel gas stream (i.e., control equipment or product specifications) at all times;

              (iv) The supporting test results from sampling the requested fuel gas stream/system demonstrating that the sulfur content is less than 5 ppmv. Sampling data must include, at minimum, 2 weeks of daily monitoring (14 grab samples) for frequently operated fuel gas streams/systems; for infrequently operated fuel gas streams/systems, seven grab samples must be collected unless other additional information would support reduced sampling. The owner or operator shall use detector tubes (“length-of-stain tube” type measurement) following the “Gas Processors Association Standard 2377-86 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17), using tubes with a maximum span between 10 and 40 ppmv inclusive when 1≤N≤10, where N = number of pump strokes, to test the applicant fuel gas stream for H2S; and

              (v) A description of how the 2 weeks (or seven samples for infrequently operated fuel gas streams/systems) of monitoring results compares to the typical range of H2S concentration (fuel quality) expected for the fuel gas stream/system going to the affected fuel gas combustion device (e.g., the 2 weeks of daily detector tube results for a frequently operated loading rack included the entire range of products loaded out, and, therefore, should be representative of typical operating conditions affecting H2S content in the fuel gas stream going to the loading rack flare).
              (2) The effective date of the exemption is the date of submission of the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section).

              (3) No further action is required unless refinery operating conditions change in such a way that affects the exempt fuel gas stream/system (e.g., the stream composition changes). If such a change occurs, the owner or operator will follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(3)(iii) of this section.

              (i) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is still within the range of concentrations included in the original application, the owner or operator shall conduct an H2S test on a grab sample and record the results as proof that the concentration is still within the range.
              (ii) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is outside the range of concentrations included in the original application, the owner or operator may submit new information following the procedures of paragraph (b)(1) of this section within 60 days (or within 30 days after the seventh grab sample is tested for infrequently operated process units).

              (iii) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is outside the range of concentrations included in the original application and the owner or operator chooses not to submit new information to support an exemption, the owner or operator must begin H2S monitoring using daily stain sampling to demonstrate compliance using length-of stain tubes with a maximum span between 200 and 400 ppmv inclusive when 1≤N≤5, where N = number of pump strokes. The owner or operator must begin monitoring according to the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section as soon as practicable but in no case later than 180 days after the operation change. During daily stain tube sampling, a daily sample exceeding 162 ppmv is an exceedance of the 3-hour H2S concentration limit.
              (c) The average coke burn-off rate (Mg (tons) per hour) and hours of operation shall be recorded daily for any fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator subject to § 60.102, § 60.103, or § 60.104(b)(2).
              (d) For any fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator under § 60.102 that uses an incinerator-waste heat boiler to combust the exhaust gases from the catalyst regenerator, the owner or operator shall record daily the rate of combustion of liquid or solid fossil-fuels and the hours of operation during which liquid or solid fossil-fuels are combusted in the incinerator-waste heat boiler.

              (e) For the purpose of reports under § 60.7(c), periods of excess emissions that shall be determined and reported are defined as follows:
              
              
                Note:
                All averages, except for opacity, shall be determined as the arithmetic average of the applicable 1-hour averages, e.g., the rolling 3-hour average shall be determined as the arithmetic average of three contiguous 1-hour averages.
              
              
              (1) Opacity. All 1-hour periods that contain two or more 6-minute periods during which the average opacity as measured by the continuous monitoring system under § 60.105(a)(1) exceeds 30 percent.

              (4) Sulfur dioxide from Claus sulfur recovery plants. (i) All 12-hour periods during which the average concentration of SO2 as measured by the SO2 continuous monitoring system under § 60.105(a)(5) exceeds 250 ppm (dry basis, zero percent excess air); or

              (ii) All 12-hour periods during which the average concentration of reduced sulfur (as SO2) as measured by the reduced sulfur continuous monitoring system under § 60.105(a)(6) exceeds 300 ppm; or

              (iii) All 12-hour periods during which the average concentration of SO2 as measured by the SO2 continuous monitoring system under § 60.105(a)(7) exceeds 250 ppm (dry basis, zero percent excess air).

              (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the CO standard in § 60.103(a) by using the integrated sampling technique of Method 10 to determine the CO concentration (dry basis). The sampling time for each run shall be 60 minutes.

              (e)(1) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the H2S standard in § 60.104(a)(1) as follows: Method 11, 15, 15A, or 16 shall be used to determine the H2S concentration. The gases entering the sampling train should be at about atmospheric pressure. If the pressure in the refinery fuel gas lines is relatively high, a flow control valve may be used to reduce the pressure. If the line pressure is high enough to operate the sampling train without a vacuum pump, the pump may be eliminated from the sampling train. The sample shall be drawn from a point near the centroid of the fuel gas line.

              (i) For Method 11, the sampling time and sample volume shall be at least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf). Two samples of equal sampling times shall be taken at about 1-hour intervals. The arithmetic average of these two samples shall constitute a run. For most fuel gases, sampling times exceeding 20 minutes may result in depletion of the collection solution, although fuel gases containing low concentrations of H2S may necessitate sampling for longer periods of time.
              (ii) For Method 15 or 16, at least three injects over a 1-hour period shall constitute a run.
              (iii) For Method 15A, a 1-hour sample shall constitute a run.
              (2) Where emissions are monitored by § 60.105(a)(3), compliance with § 60.104(a)(1) shall be determined using Method 6 or 6C and Method 3 or 3A. The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 6. A 1-hour sample shall constitute a run. Method 6 samples shall be taken at a rate of approximately 2 liters/min. The ppm correction factor (Method 6) and the sampling location in paragraph (f)(1) of this section apply. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C.

              (f) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the SO2 and the H2S and reduced sulfur standards in § 60.104(a)(2) as follows:
              (1) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO2 concentration. The concentration in mg/dscm obtained by Method 6 or 6C is multiplied by 0.3754 to obtain the concentration in ppm. The sampling point in the duct shall be the centroid of the cross section if the cross-sectional area is less than 5.00 m2 (53.8 ft2) or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.00 m (39.4 in.) if the cross-sectional area is 5.00 m2 or more and the centroid is more than 1 m from the wall. The sampling time and sample volume shall be at least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf) for each sample. Eight samples of equal sampling times shall be taken at about 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average of these eight samples shall constitute a run. For Method 6C, a run shall consist of the arithmetic average of four 1-hour samples. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal to the time it takes for two Method 6 samples. The moisture content from this sample shall be used to correct the corresponding Method 6 samples for moisture. For documenting the oxidation efficiency of the control device for reduced sulfur compounds, Method 15 shall be used following the procedures of paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
              

              (2) Method 15 shall be used to determine the reduced sulfur and H2 S concentrations. Each run shall consist of 16 samples taken over a minimum of 3 hours. The sampling point shall be the same as that described for Method 6 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. To ensure minimum residence time for the sample inside the sample lines, the sampling rate shall be at least 3.0 lpm (0.10 cfm). The SO2 equivalent for each run shall be calculated after being corrected for moisture and oxygen as the arithmetic average of the SO2 equivalent for each sample during the run. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases as the paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal to the time it takes for four Method 15 samples.

              (3) The oxygen concentration used to correct the emission rate for excess air shall be obtained by the integrated sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3 or 3A. The samples shall be taken simultaneously with the SO2, reduced sulfur and H2S, or moisture samples. The SO2, reduced sulfur, and H2S samples shall be corrected to zero percent excess air using the equation in paragraph (h)(6) of this section.
              (g) Each performance test conducted for the purpose of determining compliance under § 60.104(b) shall consist of all testing performed over a 7-day period using Method 6 or 6C and Method 3 or 3A. To determine compliance, the arithmetic mean of the results of all the tests shall be compared with the applicable standard.
              (h) For the purpose of determining compliance with § 60.104(b)(1), the following calculation procedures shall be used:
              (1) Calculate each 1-hour average concentration (dry, zero percent oxygen, ppmv) of sulfur dioxide at both the inlet and the outlet to the add-on control device as specified in § 60.13(h). These calculations are made using the emission data collected under § 60.105(a).
              (2) Calculate a 7-day average (arithmetic mean) concentration of sulfur dioxide for the inlet and for the outlet to the add-on control device using all of the 1-hour average concentration values obtained during seven successive 24-hour periods.

              (3) Calculate the 7-day average percent reduction using the following equation:
              
              Rso2 = 100(Cso2(i) − Cso2(o)) / Cso2(i)
              
              
                where:
                
                Rso2 = 7-day average sulfur dioxide emission reduction, percent
                Cso2(i) = sulfur dioxide emission concentration determined in § 60.106(h)(2) at the inlet to the add-on control device, ppmv
                Cso2(o) = sulfur dioxide emission concentration determined in § 60.106(h)(2) at the outlet to the add-on control device, ppmv
                100 = conversion factor, decimal to percent
              
              

              (4) Outlet concentrations of sulfur dioxide from the add-on control device for compliance with the 50 ppmv standard, reported on a dry, O2-free basis, shall be calculated using the procedures outlined in § 60.106(h)(1) and (2) above, but for the outlet monitor only.
              (5) If supplemental sampling data are used for determining the 7-day averages under paragraph (h) of this section and such data are not hourly averages, then the value obtained for each supplemental sample shall be assumed to represent the hourly average for each hour over which the sample was obtained.

              (6) For the purpose of adjusting pollutant concentrations to zero percent oxygen, the following equation shall be used:
              
              Cadj = Cmeas[20.9c/(20.9−%O2)]
              
              
                where:
                
                Cadj = pollutant concentration adjusted to zero percent oxygen, ppm or g/dscm
                Cmeas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis, ppm or g/dscm
                20.9c = 20.9 percent oxygen−0.0 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis), percent
                20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent
                %O2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent
              
              
              (i) For the purpose of determining compliance with § 60.104(b)(2), the following reference methods and calculation procedures shall be used except as provided in paragraph (i)(12) of this section:

              (1) One 3-hour test shall be performed each day.
              
              (2) For gases released to the atmosphere from the fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator:

              (iv) Method 3 for gas analysis.
              (3) Method 8 shall be modified by the insertion of a heated glass fiber filter between the probe and first impinger. The probe liner and glass fiber filter temperature shall be maintained above 160 °C (320 °F). The isopropanol impinger shall be eliminated. Sample recovery procedures described in Method 8 for container No. 1 shall be eliminated. The heated glass fiber filter also shall be excluded; however, rinsing of all connecting glassware after the heated glass fiber filter shall be retained and included in container No. 2. Sampled volume shall be at least 1 dscm.
              (4) For Method 3, the integrated sampling technique shall be used.
              (5) Sampling time for each run shall be at least 3 hours.

              (6) All testing shall be performed at the same location. Where the gases discharged by the fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator pass through an incinerator-waste heat boiler in which auxiliary or supplemental gaseous, liquid, or solid fossil fuel is burned, testing shall be conducted at a point between the regenerator outlet and the incinerator-waste heat boiler. An alternative sampling location after the waste heat boiler may be used if alternative coke burn-off rate equations, and, if requested, auxiliary/supplemental fuel SOX credits, have been submitted to and approved by the Administrator prior to sampling.
              (7) Coke burn-off rate shall be determined using the procedures specified under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless paragraph (i)(6) of this section applies.

              (8) Calculate the concentration of sulfur oxides as sulfur dioxide using equation 8-3 in Section 6.5 of Method 8 to calculate and report the total concentration of sulfur oxides as sulfur dioxide (Cso x).
              (9) Sulfur oxides emission rate calculated as sulfur dioxide shall be determined for each test run by the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.003
              
              
                Where:
                
                ESOx = sulfur oxides emission rate calculated as sulfur dioxide, kg/hr (lb/hr)
                CSOx = sulfur oxides emission concentration calculated as sulfur dioxide, g/dscm (gr/dscf)
                Qsd = dry volumetric stack gas flow rate corrected to standard conditions, dscm/hr (dscf/hr)
                K = 1,000 g/kg (7,000 gr/lb)
              
              
              (10) Sulfur oxides emissions calculated as sulfur dioxide shall be determined for each test run by the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.004
              
              
                Where:
                
                RSOx = Sulfur oxides emissions calculated as kg sulfur dioxide per Mg (lb/ton) coke burn-off.
                ESOx = Sulfur oxides emission rate calculated as sulfur dioxide, kg/hr (lb/hr).
                Rc = Coke burn-off rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr).
              
              
              (11) Calculate the 7-day average sulfur oxides emission rate as sulfur dioxide per Mg (ton) of coke burn-off by dividing the sum of the individual daily rates by the number of daily rates summed.
              (12) An owner or operator may, upon approval by the Administrator, use an alternative method for determining compliance with § 60.104(b)(2), as provided in § 60.8(b). Any requests for approval must include data to demonstrate to the Administrator that the alternative method would produce results adequate for the determination of compliance.
              (j) For the purpose of determining compliance with § 60.104(b)(3), the following analytical methods and calculation procedures shall be used:
              (1) One fresh feed sample shall be collected once per 8-hour period.

              (2) Fresh feed samples shall be analyzed separately by using any one of the following applicable analytical test methods: ASTM D129-64, 78, or 95, ASTM D1552-83 or 95, ASTM D2622-87, 94, or 98, or ASTM D1266-87, 91, or 98. (These methods are incorporated by reference: see § 60.17.) The applicable range of some of these ASTM methods is not adequate to measure the levels of sulfur in some fresh feed samples. Dilution of samples prior to analysis with verification of the dilution ratio is acceptable upon prior approval of the Administrator.
              (3) If a fresh feed sample cannot be collected at a single location, then the fresh feed sulfur content shall be determined as follows:
              (i) Individual samples shall be collected once per 8-hour period for each separate fresh feed stream charged directly into the riser or reactor of the fluid catalytic cracking unit. For each sample location the fresh feed volumetric flow rate at the time of collecting the fresh feed sample shall be measured and recorded. The same method for measuring volumetric flow rate shall be used at all locations.
              (ii) Each fresh feed sample shall be analyzed separately using the methods specified under paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
              (iii) Fresh feed sulfur content shall be calculated for each 8-hour period using the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.005
              
              
                where:
                
                Sf = fresh feed sulfur content expressed in percent by weight of fresh feed.
                n = number of separate fresh feed streams charged directly to the riser or reactor of the fluid catalytic cracking unit.
                Qf = total volumetric flow rate of fresh feed charged to the fluid catalytic cracking unit.
                Si = fresh feed sulfur content expressed in percent by weight of fresh feed for the “ith” sampling location.
                Qi = volumetric flow rate of fresh feed stream for the “ith” sampling location.
              
              
              (4) Calculate a 7-day average (arithmetic mean) sulfur content of the fresh feed using all of the fresh feed sulfur content values obtained during seven successive 24-hour periods.
              (k) The test methods used to supplement continuous monitoring system data to meet the minimum data requirements in § 60.104(d) will be used as described below or as otherwise approved by the Administrator.
              (1) Methods 6, 6B, or 8 are used. The sampling location(s) are the same as those specified for the monitor.
              (2) For Method 6, the minimum sampling time is 20 minutes and the minimum sampling volume is 0.02 dscm (0.71 dscf) for each sample. Samples are taken at approximately 60-minute intervals. Each sample represents a 1-hour average. A minimum of 18 valid samples is required to obtain one valid day of data.
              (3) For Method 6B, collection of a sample representing a minimum of 18 hours is required to obtain one valid day of data.
              (4) For Method 8, the procedures as outlined in this section are used. The equivalent of 16 hours of sampling is required to obtain one valid day of data.

              Performance test and compliance provisions.
              (a) Section 60.8(d) shall apply to the initial performance test specified under paragraph (c) of this section, but not to the daily performance tests required thereafter as specified in § 60.108(d). Section 60.8(f) does not apply when determining compliance with the standards specified under § 60.104(b). Performance tests conducted for the purpose of determining compliance under § 60.104(b) shall be conducted according to the applicable procedures specified under § 60.106.
              (b) Owners or operators who seek to comply with § 60.104(b)(3) shall meet that standard at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunctions.
              (c) The initial performance test shall consist of the initial 7-day average calculated for compliance with § 60.104(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3).
              (d) After conducting the initial performance test prescribed under § 60.8, the owner or operator of a fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator subject to § 60.104(b) shall conduct a performance test for each successive 24-hour period thereafter. The daily performance tests shall be conducted according to the appropriate procedures specified under § 60.106. In the event that a sample collected under § 60.106(i) or (j) is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the samples must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond the owner or operators' control, compliance may be determined using available data for the 7-day period.
              (e) Each owner or operator subject to § 60.104(b) who has demonstrated compliance with one of the provisions of § 60.104(b) but a later date seeks to comply with another of the provisions of § 60.104(b) shall begin conducting daily performance tests as specified under paragraph (d) of this section immediately upon electing to become subject to one of the other provisions of § 60.104(b). The owner or operator shall furnish the Administrator with a written notification of the change in the semiannual report required by § 60.107(f).

If the discharge pressure exceeds a set point at which the flow to the primary flare would exceed the primary flare's capacity, flow will be diverted to the second flare in the series. Similarly, flow would be diverted to a third (or fourth) flare if the pressure in the flare gas header system exceeds a threshold where the flow to the first two (or three) flares would exceed their capacities.
              
                Co-fired process heater means a process heater that employs burners that are designed to be supplied by both gaseous and liquid fuels on a routine basis. Process heaters that have gas burners with emergency oil back-up burners are not considered co-fired process heaters.
              
                Coke burn-off means the coke removed from the surface of the FCCU catalyst by combustion in the catalyst regenerator. The rate of coke burn-off is calculated by the formula specified in § 60.104a.

                Flare gas header system means all piping and knockout pots, including those in a subheader system, used to collect and transport gas to a flare either from a process unit or a pressure relief valve from the fuel gas system, regardless of whether or not a flare gas recovery system draws gas from the flare gas header system. The flare gas header system includes piping inside the battery limit of a process unit if the purpose of the piping is to transport gas to a flare or knockout pot that is part of the flare.
              
                Flare gas recovery system means a system of one or more compressors, piping and the associated water seal, rupture disk or similar device used to divert gas from the flare and direct the gas to the fuel gas system or to a fuel gas combustion device.
              
                Flexicoking unit means a refinery process unit in which high molecular weight petroleum derivatives are thermally cracked and petroleum coke is continuously produced and then gasified to produce a synthetic fuel gas.

                Forced draft process heater means a process heater in which the combustion air is supplied under positive pressure produced by a fan at any location in the inlet air line prior to the point where the combustion air enters the process heater or air preheat. For the purposes of this subpart, a process heater that uses fans at both the inlet air side and the exhaust air side (i.e., balanced draft system) is considered to be a forced draft process heater.
              
              
                Fuel gas means any gas which is generated at a petroleum refinery and which is combusted. Fuel gas includes natural gas when the natural gas is combined and combusted in any proportion with a gas generated at a refinery. Fuel gas does not include gases generated by catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators, coke calciners (used to make premium grade coke) and fluid coking burners, but does include gases from flexicoking unit gasifiers and other gasifiers. Fuel gas does not include vapors that are collected and combusted in a thermal oxidizer or flare installed to control emissions from wastewater treatment units other than those processing sour water, marine tank vessel loading operations or asphalt processing units (i.e., asphalt blowing stills).
              
                Fuel gas combustion device means any equipment, such as process heaters and boilers, used to combust fuel gas.

                Fuel gas system means a system of compressors, piping, knock-out pots, mix drums, and units used to remove sulfur contaminants from the fuel gas (e.g., amine scrubbers) that collects refinery fuel gas from one or more sources for treatment as necessary prior to combusting in process heaters or boilers. A fuel gas system may have an overpressure vent to a flare but the primary purpose for a fuel gas system is to provide fuel to the refinery.
              
                Natural draft process heater means any process heater in which the combustion air is supplied under ambient or negative pressure without the use of an inlet air (forced draft) fan. For the purposes of this subpart, a natural draft process heater is any process heater that is not a forced draft process heater, including induced draft systems.
              
                Non-emergency flare means any flare that is not an emergency flare as defined in this subpart.
              
                Oxidation control system means an emission control system which reduces emissions from sulfur recovery plants by converting these emissions to sulfur dioxide (SO2) and recycling the SO2 to the reactor furnace or the first-stage catalytic reactor of the Claus sulfur recovery plant or converting the SO2 to a sulfur product.
              
                Petroleum means the crude oil removed from the earth and the oils derived from tar sands, shale, and coal.
              
                Petroleum refinery means any facility engaged in producing gasoline, kerosene, distillate fuel oils, residual fuel oils, lubricants, asphalt (bitumen) or other products through distillation of petroleum or through redistillation, cracking or reforming of unfinished petroleum derivatives. A facility that produces only oil shale or tar sands-derived crude oil for further processing at a petroleum refinery using only solvent extraction and/or distillation to recover diluent is not a petroleum refinery.
              
              
                Primary flare means the first flare in a cascaded flare system.
              
                Process heater means an enclosed combustion device used to transfer heat indirectly to process stream materials (liquids, gases, or solids) or to a heat transfer material for use in a process unit instead of steam.
              
                Process upset gas means any gas generated by a petroleum refinery process unit or by ancillary equipment as a result of startup, shutdown, upset or malfunction.
              
                Purge gas means gas introduced between a flare's water seal and a flare's tip to prevent oxygen infiltration (backflow) into the flare tip. For flares with no water seals, the function of purge gas is performed by sweep gas (i.e., flares without water seals do not use purge gas).
              
                Reduced sulfur compounds means hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbonyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide.
              
                Reduction control system means an emission control system which reduces emissions from sulfur recovery plants by converting these emissions to H2S and either recycling the H2S to the reactor furnace or the first-stage catalytic reactor of the Claus sulfur recovery plant or converting the H2S to a sulfur product.
              
                Refinery process unit means any segment of the petroleum refinery in which a specific processing operation is conducted.
              
                Root cause analysis means an assessment conducted through a process of investigation to determine the primary cause, and any other contributing cause(s), of a discharge of gases in excess of specified thresholds.
              
                Secondary flare means a flare in a cascaded flare system that provides additional flare capacity and pressure relief to a flare gas system when the flare gas flow exceeds the capacity of the primary flare. For purposes of this subpart, a secondary flare is characterized by infrequent use and must maintain a water seal.
              
                Sour water means water that contains sulfur compounds (usually H2S) at concentrations of 10 parts per million by weight or more.
              
              
                Sulfur pit means the storage vessel in which sulfur that is condensed after each Claus catalytic reactor is initially accumulated and stored. A sulfur pit does not include secondary sulfur storage vessels downstream of the initial Claus reactor sulfur pits.
              
                Sulfur recovery plant means all process units which recover sulfur from H2S and/or SO2 from a common source of sour gas produced at a petroleum refinery. The sulfur recovery plant also includes sulfur pits used to store the recovered sulfur product, but it does not include secondary sulfur storage vessels or loading facilities downstream of the sulfur pits. For example, a Claus sulfur recovery plant includes: Reactor furnace and waste heat boiler, catalytic reactors, sulfur pits and, if present, oxidation or reduction control systems or incinerator, thermal oxidizer or similar combustion device. Multiple sulfur recovery units are a single affected facility only when the units share the same source of sour gas. Sulfur recovery plants that receive source gas from completely segregated sour gas treatment systems are separate affected facilities.
              
                Sweep gas means the gas introduced in a flare gas header system to maintain a constant flow of gas to prevent oxygen buildup in the flare header. For flares with no water seals, sweep gas also performs the function of preventing oxygen infiltration (backflow) into the flare tip.

                %O2 = O2 concentration of the air/oxygen mixture supplied to the Claus burner, percent by volume (dry basis). If only ambient air is used in the Claus burner or if the owner or operator elects not to monitor O2 concentration of the air/oxygen mixture used in the Claus burner or for non-Claus sulfur recovery plants, use 20.9% for %O2.

For CO boilers or furnaces that are part of a fluid catalytic cracking unit or fluid coking unit affected facility, the owner or operator shall comply with the fuel gas concentration limit in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) for all fuel gas streams combusted in these units.

              (i) The owner or operator shall not discharge or cause the discharge of any gases into the atmosphere that contain SO2 in excess of 20 ppmv (dry basis, corrected to 0-percent excess air) determined hourly on a 3-hour rolling average basis and SO2 in excess of 8 ppmv (dry basis, corrected to 0-percent excess air), determined daily on a 365 successive calendar day rolling average basis; or

              (B) A description of the low-NOX burner designs and other combustion modifications considered for reducing NOX emissions;
              (C) The combustion modification option selected; and

              (D) The operating conditions (firing rate, heater box temperature and excess oxygen concentration) at which the NOX emission level was established.
              

              (ii) If the request is approved by the Administrator, a facility-specific NOX emissions limit will be established at the NOX emission level demonstrated in the approved request.
              (iii) If the Administrator finds any deficiencies in the request, the request must be revised to address the deficiencies and be re-submitted for approval.

              § 60.103a
              Design, equipment, work practice or operational standards.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, each owner or operator that operates a flare that is subject to this subpart shall develop and implement a written flare management plan no later than the date specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The flare management plan must include the information described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section.
              (1) A listing of all refinery process units, ancillary equipment, and fuel gas systems connected to the flare for each affected flare.
              (2) An assessment of whether discharges to affected flares from these process units, ancillary equipment and fuel gas systems can be minimized. The flare minimization assessment must (at a minimum) consider the items in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section. The assessment must provide clear rationale in terms of costs (capital and annual operating), natural gas offset credits (if applicable), technical feasibility, secondary environmental impacts and safety considerations for the selected minimization alternative(s) or a statement, with justifications, that flow reduction could not be achieved. Based upon the assessment, each owner or operator of an affected flare shall identify the minimization alternatives that it has implemented by the due date of the flare management plan and shall include a schedule for the prompt implementation of any selected measures that cannot reasonably be completed as of that date.
              (i) Elimination of process gas discharge to the flare through process operating changes or gas recovery at the source.
              (ii) Reduction of the volume of process gas to the flare through process operating changes.
              (iii) Installation of a flare gas recovery system or, for facilities that are fuel gas rich, a flare gas recovery system and a co-generation unit or combined heat and power unit.

              (3) A description of each affected flare containing the information in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.
              (i) A general description of the flare, including the information in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) through (G) of this section.
              (A) Whether it is a ground flare or elevated (including height).
              (B) The type of assist system (e.g., air, steam, pressure, non-assisted).
              (C) Whether it is simple or complex flare tip (e.g., staged, sequential).
              (D) Whether the flare is part of a cascaded flare system (and if so, whether the flare is primary or secondary).
              (E) Whether the flare serves as a backup to another flare.
              (F) Whether the flare is an emergency flare or a non-emergency flare.
              (G) Whether the flare is equipped with a flare gas recovery system.
              (ii) Description and simple process flow diagram showing the interconnection of the following components of the flare: flare tip (date installed, manufacturer, nominal and effective tip diameter, tip drawing); knockout or surge drum(s) or pot(s) (including dimensions and design capacities); flare header(s) and subheader(s); assist system; and ignition system.
              (iii) Flare design parameters, including the maximum vent gas flow rate; minimum sweep gas flow rate; minimum purge gas flow rate (if any); maximum supplemental gas flow rate; maximum pilot gas flow rate; and, if the flare is steam-assisted, minimum total steam rate.

              (iv) Description and simple process flow diagram showing all gas lines (including flare, purge (if applicable), sweep, supplemental and pilot gas) that are associated with the flare. For purge, sweep, supplemental and pilot gas, identify the type of gas used. Designate which lines are exempt from sulfur, H2S or flow monitoring and why (e.g., natural gas, inherently low sulfur, pilot gas). Designate which lines are monitored and identify on the process flow diagram the location and type of each monitor.
              (v) For each flow rate, H2S, sulfur content, pressure or water seal monitor identified in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section, provide a detailed description of the manufacturer's specifications, including, but not limited to, make, model, type, range, precision, accuracy, calibration, maintenance and quality assurance procedures.
              (vi) For emergency flares, secondary flares and flares equipped with a flare gas recovery system designed, sized and operated to capture all flows except those resulting from startup, shutdown or malfunction:
              (A) Description of the water seal, including the operating range for the liquid level.
              (B) Designation of the monitoring option elected (flow and sulfur monitoring or pressure and water seal liquid level monitoring).
              (vii) For flares equipped with a flare gas recovery system:

The baseline flow to the flare must be determined after implementing the minimization assessment in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Baseline flows do not include pilot gas flow or purge gas flow (i.e., gas introduced after the flare's water seal) provided these gas flows remain reasonably constant (i.e., separate flow monitors for these streams are not required). Separate baseline flow rates may be established for different operating conditions provided that the management plan includes:
              (i) A primary baseline flow rate that will be used as the default baseline for all conditions except those specifically delineated in the plan;
              (ii) A description of each special condition for which an alternate baseline is established, including the rationale for each alternate baseline, the daily flow for each alternate baseline and the expected duration of the special conditions for each alternate baseline; and
              (iii) Procedures to minimize discharges to the affected flare during each special condition described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, unless procedures are already developed for these cases under paragraph (a)(5) through (7) of this section, as applicable.
              (5) Procedures to minimize or eliminate discharges to the flare during the planned startup and shutdown of the refinery process units and ancillary equipment that are connected to the affected flare, together with a schedule for the prompt implementation of any procedures that cannot reasonably be implemented as of the date of the submission of the flare management plan.

              (6) Procedures to reduce flaring in cases of fuel gas imbalance (i.e., excess fuel gas for the refinery's energy needs), together with a schedule for the prompt implementation of any procedures that cannot reasonably be implemented as of the date of the submission of the flare management plan.
              (7) For flares equipped with flare gas recovery systems, procedures to minimize the frequency and duration of outages of the flare gas recovery system and procedures to minimize the volume of gas flared during such outages, together with a schedule for the prompt implementation of any procedures that cannot reasonably be implemented as of the date of the submission of the flare management plan.

              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, each owner or operator required to develop and implement a written flare management plan as described in paragraph (a) of this section must submit the plan to the Administrator as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator of a newly constructed or reconstructed flare must develop and implement the flare management plan by no later than the date that the flare becomes an affected facility subject to this subpart, except for the selected minimization alternatives in paragraph (a)(2) and/or the procedures in paragraphs (a)(5) though (a)(7) of this section that cannot reasonably be implemented by that date, which the owner or operator must implement in accordance with the schedule in the flare management plan. The owner or operator of a modified flare must develop and implement the flare management plan by no later than November 11, 2015 or upon startup of the modified flare, whichever is later.
              (2) The owner or operator must comply with the plan as submitted by the date specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The plan should be updated periodically to account for changes in the operation of the flare, such as new connections to the flare or the installation of a flare gas recovery system, but the plan need be re-submitted to the Administrator only if the owner or operator adds an alternative baseline flow rate, revises an existing baseline as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, installs a flare gas recovery system or is required to change flare designations and monitoring methods as described in § 60.107a(g). The owner or operator must comply with the updated plan as submitted.

              (3) All versions of the plan submitted to the Administrator shall also be submitted to the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Sector Policies and Programs Division, U.S. EPA Mailroom (E143-01), Attention: Refinery Sector Lead, 109 T.W.

              (1) For a flare:
              (i) Any time the SO2 emissions exceed 227 kilograms (kg) (500 lb) in any 24-hour period; or
              (ii) Any discharge to the flare in excess of 14,160 standard cubic meters (m3) (500,000 standard cubic feet (scf)) above the baseline, determined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, in any 24-hour period; or
              (iii) If the monitoring alternative in § 60.107a(g) is elected, any period when the flare gas line pressure exceeds the water seal liquid depth, except for periods attributable to compressor staging that do not exceed the staging time specified in paragraph (a)(3)(vii)(C) of this section.

              (2) For a fuel gas combustion device, each exceedance of an applicable short-term emissions limit in § 60.102a(g)(1) if the SO2 discharge to the atmosphere is 227 kg (500 lb) greater than the amount that would have been emitted if the emissions limits had been met during one or more consecutive periods of excess emissions or any 24-hour period, whichever is shorter.
              (3) For a sulfur recovery plant, each time the SO2 emissions are more than 227 kg (500 lb) greater than the amount that would have been emitted if the SO2 or reduced sulfur concentration was equal to the applicable emissions limit in § 60.102a(f)(1) or (2) during one or more consecutive periods of excess emissions or any 24-hour period, whichever is shorter.
              (d) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a root cause analysis and corrective action analysis must be completed as soon as possible, but no later than 45 days after a discharge meeting one of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. Special circumstances affecting the number of root cause analyses and/or corrective action analyses are provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.

              (1) If a single continuous discharge meets any of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section for 2 or more consecutive 24-hour periods, a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis may be conducted.
              (2) If a single discharge from a flare triggers a root cause analysis based on more than one of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis may be conducted.
              (3) If the discharge from a flare is the result of a planned startup or shutdown of a refinery process unit or ancillary equipment connected to the affected flare and the procedures in paragraph (a)(5) of this section were followed, a root cause analysis and corrective action analysis is not required; however, the discharge must be recorded as described in § 60.108a(c)(6) and reported as described in § 60.108a(d)(5).
              (4) If both the primary and secondary flare in a cascaded flare system meet any of the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section in the same 24-hour period, a single root cause analysis and corrective action analysis may be conducted.

              (6) For process heaters with a rated heat capacity between 40 and 100 MMBtu/hr that elect to demonstrate continuous compliance with a maximum excess oxygen limit as provided in § 60.107a(c)(6) or (d)(8), the owner or operator shall establish the O2 operating limit or O2 operating curve based on the performance test results according to the requirements in paragraph (i)(6)(i) or (ii) of this section, respectively.
              (i) If a single O2 operating limit will be used:
              (A) Conduct the performance test following the methods provided in paragraphs (i)(1), (2), (3) and (5) of this section when the process heater is firing at no less than 70 percent of the rated heat capacity. For co-fired process heaters, conduct at least one of the test runs while the process heater is being supplied by both fuel gas and fuel oil and conduct at least one of the test runs while the process heater is being supplied solely by fuel gas.

              (B) Each test will consist of three test runs. Calculate the NOX concentration for the performance test as the average of the NOX concentrations from each of the three test runs. If the NOX concentration for the performance test is less than or equal to the numerical value of the applicable NOX emissions limit (regardless of averaging time), then the test is considered to be a valid test.
              (C) Determine the average O2 concentration for each test run of a valid test.
              (D) Calculate the O2 operating limit as the average O2 concentration of the three test runs from a valid test.
              (ii) If an O2 operating curve will be used:

              (A) Conduct a performance test following the methods provided in paragraphs (i)(1), (2), (3) and (5) of this section at a representative condition for each operating range for which different O2 operating limits will be established. Different operating conditions may be defined as different firing rates (e.g., above 50 percent of rated heat capacity and at or below 50 percent of rated heat capacity) and/or, for co-fired process heaters, different fuel mixtures (e.g., primarily gas fired, primarily oil fired, and equally co-fired, i.e., approximately 50 percent of the input heating value is from fuel gas and approximately 50 percent of the input heating value is from fuel oil). Performance tests for different operating ranges may be conducted at different times.

              (B) Each test will consist of three test runs. Calculate the NOX concentration for the performance test as the average of the NOX concentrations from each of the three test runs. If the NOX concentration for the performance test is less than or equal to the numerical value of the applicable NOX emissions limit (regardless of averaging time), then the test is considered to be a valid test.

              (C) If an operating curve is developed for different firing rates, conduct at least one test when the process heater is firing at no less than 70 percent of the rated heat capacity and at least one test under turndown conditions (i.e., when the process heater is firing at 50 percent or less of the rated heat capacity). If O2 operating limits are developed for co-fired process heaters based only on overall firing rates (and not by fuel mixtures), conduct at least one of the test runs for each test while the process heater is being supplied by both fuel gas and fuel oil and conduct at least one of the test runs while the process heater is being supplied solely by fuel gas.
              (D) Determine the average O2 concentration for each test run of a valid test.
              (E) Calculate the O2 operating limit for each operating range as the average O2 concentration of the three test runs from a valid test conducted at the representative conditions for that given operating range.

              (F) Identify the firing rates for which the different operating limits apply. If only two operating limits are established based on firing rates, the O2 operating limits established when the process heater is firing at no less than 70 percent of the rated heat capacity must apply when the process heater is firing above 50 percent of the rated heat capacity and the O2 operating limits established for turndown conditions must apply when the process heater is firing at 50 percent or less of the rated heat capacity.
              (G) Operating limits associated with each interval will be valid for 2 years or until another operating limit is established for that interval based on a more recent performance test specific for that interval, whichever occurs first. Owners and operators must use the operating limits determined for a given interval based on the most recent performance test conducted for that interval.

              (7) The owner or operator of a process heater complying with a NOX limit in terms of lb/MMBtu as provided in § 60.102a(g)(2)(i)(B), (g)(2)(ii)(B), (g)(2)(iii)(B) or (g)(2)(iv)(B) or a process heater with a rated heat capacity between 40 and 100 MMBtu/hr that elects to demonstrate continuous compliance with a maximum excess O2 limit, as provided in § 60.107a(c)(6) or (d)(8), shall determine heat input to the process heater in MMBtu/hr during each performance test run by measuring fuel gas flow rate, fuel oil flow rate (as applicable) and heating value content according to the methods provided in § 60.107a(d)(5), (d)(6), and (d)(4) or (d)(7), respectively.

              (8) The owner or operator shall use Equation 8 of this section to adjust pollutant concentrations to 0-percent O2 or 0- percent excess air.

              (j) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the applicable H2S emissions limit in § 60.102a(g)(1) for a fuel gas combustion device or the concentration requirement in § 60.103a(h) for a flare according to the following test methods and procedures:
              (1)—(3) [Reserved]

              (4) EPA Method 11, 15 or 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60 or EPA Method 16 of appendix A-6 to part 60 for determining the H2S concentration for affected facilities using an H2S monitor as specified in § 60.107a(a)(2). The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60. The owner or operator may demonstrate compliance based on the mixture used in the fuel gas combustion device or flare or for each individual fuel gas stream used in the fuel gas combustion device or flare.

              (i) For Method 11 of appendix A-5 to part 60, the sampling time and sample volume must be at least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf). Two samples of equal sampling times must be taken at about 1-hour intervals. The arithmetic average of these two samples constitutes a run. For most fuel gases, sampling times exceeding 20 minutes may result in depletion of the collection solution, although fuel gases containing low concentrations of H2S may necessitate sampling for longer periods of time.

              (ii) For Method 15 of appendix A-5 to part 60, at least three injects over a 1-hour period constitutes a run.
              
              (iii) For Method 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60, a 1-hour sample constitutes a run. The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60.
              (iv) If monitoring is conducted at a single point in a common source of fuel gas as allowed under § 60.107a(a)(2)(iv), only one performance test is required. That is, performance tests are not required when a new affected fuel gas combustion device or flare is added to a common source of fuel gas that previously demonstrated compliance.

              § 60.107a
              Monitoring of emissions and operations for fuel gas combustion devices and flares.
              (a) Fuel gas combustion devices subject to SO2 or H2S limit and flares subject to H2S concentration requirements. The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device that is subject to § 60.102a(g)(1) and elects to comply with the SO2 emission limits in § 60.102a(g)(1)(i) shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device that is subject to § 60.102a(g)(1) and elects to comply with the H2S concentration limits in § 60.102a(g)(1)(ii) or a flare that is subject to the H2S concentration requirement in § 60.103a(h) shall comply with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

              (1) The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device that elects to comply with the SO2 emissions limits in § 60.102a(g)(1)(i) shall install, operate, calibrate and maintain an instrument for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration (dry basis, 0-percent excess air) of SO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The monitor must include an O2 monitor for correcting the data for excess air.

              (i) The owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain each SO2 monitor according to Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part. The span value for the SO2 monitor is 50 ppmv SO2.

              (ii) The owner or operator shall conduct performance evaluations for the SO2 monitor according to the requirements of § 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part. The owner or operator shall use Methods 6, 6A, or 6C of appendix A-4 to this part for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 6 or 6A of appendix A-4 to this part. Samples taken by Method 6 of appendix A-4 to this part shall be taken at a flow rate of approximately 2 liters/min for at least 30 minutes. The relative accuracy limit shall be 20 percent or 4 ppmv, whichever is greater, and the calibration drift limit shall be 5 percent of the established span value.
              

              (iii) The owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain each O2 monitor according to Performance Specification 3 of appendix B to part 60. The span value for the O2 monitor must be selected between 10 and 25 percent, inclusive.

              (iv) The owner or operator shall conduct performance evaluations for the O2 monitor according to the requirements of § 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 3 of appendix B to part 60. The owner or operator shall use Methods 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A-2 to part 60 for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 3B of appendix A-2 to part 60.

              (v) The owner or operator shall comply with the applicable quality assurance procedures in appendix F to part 60, including quarterly accuracy determinations for SO2 monitors, annual accuracy determinations for O2 monitors, and daily calibration drift tests.

              (vi) Fuel gas combustion devices having a common source of fuel gas may be monitored at only one location (i.e., after one of the combustion devices), if monitoring at this location accurately represents the SO2 emissions into the atmosphere from each of the combustion devices.

              (2) The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device that elects to comply with the H2S concentration limits in § 60.102a(g)(1)(ii) or a flare that is subject to the H2S concentration requirement in § 60.103a(h) shall install, operate, calibrate and maintain an instrument for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration by volume (dry basis) of H2S in the fuel gases before being burned in any fuel gas combustion device or flare.

              (i) The owner or operator shall install, operate and maintain each H2S monitor according to Performance Specification 7 of appendix B to part 60. The span value for this instrument is 300 ppmv H2S.

              (ii) The owner or operator shall conduct performance evaluations for each H2S monitor according to the requirements of § 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 7 of appendix B to part 60. The owner or operator shall use Method 11, 15, or 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60 or Method 16 of appendix A-6 to part 60 for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60.

              (iii) The owner or operator shall comply with the applicable quality assurance procedures in appendix F to part 60 for each H2S monitor.

              (iv) Fuel gas combustion devices or flares having a common source of fuel gas may be monitored at only one location, if monitoring at this location accurately represents the concentration of H2S in the fuel gas being burned in the respective fuel gas combustion devices or flares.

              (v) The owner or operator of a flare subject to § 60.103a(c) through (e) may use the instrument required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the H2S concentration requirement in § 60.103a(h) if the owner or operator complies with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(i) through (iv) and if the instrument has a span (or dual span, if necessary) capable of accurately measuring concentrations between 20 and 300 ppmv. If the instrument required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is used to demonstrate compliance with the H2S concentration requirement, the concentration directly measured by the instrument must meet the numeric concentration in § 60.103a(h).
              (vi) The owner or operator of modified flare that meets all three criteria in paragraphs (a)(2)(vi)(A) through (C) of this section shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v) of this section no later than November 11, 2015. The owner or operator shall comply with the approved alternative monitoring plan or plans pursuant to § 60.13(i) until the flare is in compliance with requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.

              (A) The flare was an affected facility subject to subpart J of this part prior to becoming an affected facility under § 60.100a.
              
              (B) The owner or operator had an approved alternative monitoring plan or plans pursuant to § 60.13(i) for all fuel gases combusted in the flare.

              (C) The flare did not have in place on or before September 12, 2012 an instrument for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration by volume (dry basis) of H2S in the fuel gases that is capable of complying with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
              (3) The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device or flare is not required to comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section for fuel gas streams that are exempt under §§ 60.102a(g)(1)(iii) or 60.103a(h) or, for fuel gas streams combusted in a process heater, other fuel gas combustion device or flare that are inherently low in sulfur content. Fuel gas streams meeting one of the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section will be considered inherently low in sulfur content.
              (i) Pilot gas for heaters and flares.
              (ii) Fuel gas streams that meet a commercial-grade product specification for sulfur content of 30 ppmv or less. In the case of a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) product specification in the pressurized liquid state, the gas phase sulfur content should be evaluated assuming complete vaporization of the LPG and sulfur containing-compounds at the product specification concentration.
              (iii) Fuel gas streams produced in process units that are intolerant to sulfur contamination, such as fuel gas streams produced in the hydrogen plant, catalytic reforming unit, isomerization unit, and HF alkylation process units.
              (iv) Other fuel gas streams that an owner or operator demonstrates are low-sulfur according to the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (4) If the composition of an exempt fuel gas stream changes, the owner or operator must follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (b) Exemption from H
                2
                S monitoring requirements for low-sulfur fuel gas streams. The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device or flare may apply for an exemption from the H2S monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for a fuel gas stream that is inherently low in sulfur content. A fuel gas stream that is demonstrated to be low-sulfur is exempt from the monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section until there are changes in operating conditions or stream composition.
              (1) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a written application for an exemption from monitoring. The application must contain the following information:
              (i) A description of the fuel gas stream/system to be considered, including submission of a portion of the appropriate piping diagrams indicating the boundaries of the fuel gas stream/system and the affected fuel gas combustion device(s) or flare(s) to be considered;

              (ii) A statement that there are no crossover or entry points for sour gas (high H2S content) to be introduced into the fuel gas stream/system (this should be shown in the piping diagrams);
              (iii) An explanation of the conditions that ensure low amounts of sulfur in the fuel gas stream (i.e., control equipment or product specifications) at all times;

              (iv) The supporting test results from sampling the requested fuel gas stream/system demonstrating that the sulfur content is less than 5 ppmv H2S. Sampling data must include, at minimum, 2 weeks of daily monitoring (14 grab samples) for frequently operated fuel gas streams/systems; for infrequently operated fuel gas streams/systems, seven grab samples must be collected unless other additional information would support reduced sampling. The owner or operator shall use detector tubes (“length-of-stain tube” type measurement) following the “Gas Processors Association Standard 2377-86 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17), using tubes with a maximum span between 10 and 40 ppmv inclusive when 1≤N≤10, where N = number of pump strokes, to test the applicant fuel gas stream for H2S; and

              (v) A description of how the 2 weeks (or seven samples for infrequently operated fuel gas streams/systems) of monitoring results compares to the typical range of H2S concentration (fuel quality) expected for the fuel gas stream/system going to the affected fuel gas combustion device or flare (e.g., the 2 weeks of daily detector tube results for a frequently operated loading rack included the entire range of products loaded out and, therefore, should be representative of typical operating conditions affecting H2S content in the fuel gas stream going to the loading rack flare).
              (2) The effective date of the exemption is the date of submission of the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
              (3) No further action is required unless refinery operating conditions change in such a way that affects the exempt fuel gas stream/system (e.g., the stream composition changes). If such a change occurs, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(3)(iii) of this section.

              (i) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is still within the range of concentrations included in the original application, the owner or operator shall conduct an H2S test on a grab sample and record the results as proof that the concentration is still within the range.
              (ii) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is outside the range of concentrations included in the original application, the owner or operator may submit new information following the procedures of paragraph (b)(1) of this section within 60 days (or within 30 days after the seventh grab sample is tested for infrequently operated process units).

              (iii) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is outside the range of concentrations included in the original application and the owner or operator chooses not to submit new information to support an exemption, the owner or operator must begin H2S monitoring using daily stain sampling to demonstrate compliance using length-of-stain tubes with a maximum span between 200 and 400 ppmv inclusive when 1≤N≤5, where N = number of pump strokes. The owner or operator must begin monitoring according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section as soon as practicable, but in no case later than 180 days after the operation change. During daily stain tube sampling, a daily sample exceeding 162 ppmv is an exceedance of the 3-hour H2S concentration limit. The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device must also determine a rolling 365-day average using the stain sampling results; an average H2S concentration of 5 ppmv must be used for days within the rolling 365-day period prior to the operation change.

              (5) The owner or operator shall comply with the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of appendix F to part 60 for each NOX and O2 monitor, including quarterly accuracy determinations for NOX monitors, annual accuracy determinations for O2 monitors, and daily calibration drift tests.

              (6) The owner or operator of a process heater that has a rated heating capacity of less than 100 MMBtu and is equipped with combustion modification-based technology to reduce NOX emissions (i.e., low-NOX burners, ultra-low-NOX burners) may elect to comply with the monitoring requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section or, alternatively, the owner or operator of such a process heater shall conduct biennial performance tests according to the requirements in § 60.104a(i), establish a maximum excess O2 operating limit or operating curve according to the requirements in § 60.104a(i)(6) and comply with the O2 monitoring requirements in paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) of this section to demonstrate compliance.

Different options may be elected for different gas lines. If a monitoring system is in place that is capable of complying with the requirements related to either paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of a modified flare must comply with the requirements related to either paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section upon startup of the modified flare. If a monitoring system is not in place that is capable of complying with the requirements related to either paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of a modified flare must comply with the requirements related to either paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section no later than November 11, 2015 or upon startup of the modified flare, whichever is later.
              (1) Total reduced sulfur monitoring requirements. The owner or operator shall install, operate, calibrate and maintain an instrument or instruments for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration of total reduced sulfur in gas discharged to the flare.
              (i) The owner or operator shall install, operate and maintain each total reduced sulfur monitor according to Performance Specification 5 of appendix B to part 60. The span value should be determined based on the maximum sulfur content of gas that can be discharged to the flare (e.g., roughly 1.1 to 1.3 times the maximum anticipated sulfur concentration), but may be no less than 5,000 ppmv. A single dual range monitor may be used to comply with the requirements of this paragraph and paragraph (a)(2) of this section provided the applicable span specifications are met.

The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 15A of appendix A-5 to this part. The alternative relative accuracy procedures described in section 16.0 of Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part (cylinder gas audits) may be used for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations, except that it is not necessary to include as much of the sampling probe or sampling line as practical.

              (iii) The owner or operator shall comply with the applicable quality assurance procedures in appendix F to part 60 for each H2S monitor.
              (iv) In the first 10 operating days after the date the flare must begin to comply with § 60.103a(c)(1), the owner or operator shall collect representative daily samples of the gas discharged to the flare. The samples may be grab samples or integrated samples. The owner or operator shall take subsequent representative daily samples at least once per week or as required in paragraph (e)(2)(ix) of this section.
              (v) The owner or operator shall analyze each daily sample for total sulfur using either EPA Method 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60, EPA Method 16A of appendix A-6 to part 60, ASTM Method D4468-85 (Reapproved 2006) (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) or ASTM Method D5504-08 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17).

              (i) Flares that can only receive:
              (A) Fuel gas streams that are inherently low in sulfur content as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section; and/or

If the required monitoring systems are not already in place, the owner or operator of a modified flare shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph by no later than November 11, 2015 or upon startup of the modified flare, whichever is later.
              (1) Locate the pressure sensor(s) in a position that provides a representative measurement of the pressure and locate the liquid seal level monitor in a position that provides a representative measurement of the water column height.
              (2) Minimize or eliminate pulsating pressure, vibration and internal and external corrosion.
              (3) Use a pressure sensor and level monitor with a minimum tolerance of 1.27 centimeters of water.
              (4) Using a manometer, check pressure sensor calibration quarterly.
              (5) Conduct calibration checks any time the pressure sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range or install a new pressure sensor.

              (6) In a cascaded flare system that employs multiple secondary flares, pressure and liquid level monitoring is required only on the first secondary flare in the system (i.e., the secondary flare with the lowest pressure release set point).
              (7) This alternative monitoring option may be elected only for flares with four or fewer pressure exceedances required to be reported under § 60.108a(d)(5) (“reportable pressure exceedances”) in any 365 consecutive calendar days.

              Testing and procedures.
              (a) Except as provided in § 60.8(b) compliance with the standard prescribed in § 60.112a shall be determined as follows or in accordance with an equivalent procedure as provided in § 60.114a.

              (1) The owner or operator of each storage vessel to which this subpart applies which has an external floating roof shall meet the following requirements:
              
              (i) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the primary seal and the tank wall and between the secondary seal and the tank wall according to the following frequency:
              (A) For primary seals, gap measurements shall be performed within 60 days of the initial fill with petroleum liquid and at least once every five years thereafter. All primary seal inspections or gap measurements which require the removal or dislodging of the secondary seal shall be accomplished as rapidly as possible and the secondary seal shall be replaced as soon as possible.
              (B) For secondary seals, gap measurements shall be performed within 60 days of the initial fill with petroleum liquid and at least once every year thereafter.
              (C) If any storage vessel is out of service for a period of one year or more, subsequent refilling with petroleum liquid shall be considered initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) and (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
              (D) Keep records of each gap measurement at the plant for a period of at least 2 years following the date of measurement. Each record shall identify the vessel on which the measurement was performed and shall contain the date of the seal gap measurement, the raw data obtained in the measurement process required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section and the calculation required by paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (E) If either the seal gap calculated in accord with paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section or the measured maximum seal gap exceeds the limitations specified by § 60.112a of this subpart, a report shall be furnished to the Administrator within 60 days of the date of measurements. The report shall identify the vessel and list each reason why the vessel did not meet the specifications of § 60.112a. The report shall also describe the actions necessary to bring the storage vessel into compliance with the specifications of § 60.112a.
              (ii) Determine gap widths in the primary and secondary seals individually by the following procedures:
              (A) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
              (B) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the tank in each place where a 1/8″ diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and the tank wall and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
              (C) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section shall be determined by using probes of various widths to accurately measure the actual distance from the tank wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
              (iii) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually. Divide the sum for each seal by the nominal diameter of the tank and compare each ratio to the appropriate ratio in the standard in § 60.112a(a)(1)(i) and § 60.112a(a)(1)(ii).
              (iv) Provide the Administrator 30 days prior notice of the gap measurement to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present.
              (2) The owner or operator of each storage vessel to which this subpart applies which has a vapor recovery and return or disposal system shall provide the following information to the Administrator on or before the date on which construction of the storage vessel commences:
              (i) Emission data, if available, for a similar vapor recovery and return or disposal system used on the same type of storage vessel, which can be used to determine the efficiency of the system. A complete description of the emission measurement method used must be included.
              (ii) The manufacturer's design specifications and estimated emission reduction capability of the system.
              (iii) The operation and maintenance plan for the system.

              § 60.114a
              Alternative means of emission limitation.

              (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions achieved by any requirement in § 60.112a, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement.
              (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section will be published only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
              (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit to the Administrator a written application including:
              (1) An actual emissions test that uses a full-sized or scale-model storage vessel that accurately collects and measures all VOC emissions from a given control device and that accurately simulates wind and accounts for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure.
              (2) An engineering evaluation that the Administrator determines is an accurate method of determining equivalence.
              (d) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the same emissions reduction as specified in § 60.112a.
              (e) The primary vapor-mounted seal in the “Volume-Maximizing Seal” manufactured by R.F.I. Services Corporation is approved as equivalent to the vapor-mounted seal required by § 60.112a(a)(1)(i) and must meet the gap criteria specified in § 60.112a(a)(1)(i)(B). There shall be no gaps between the tank wall and any secondary seal used in conjunction with the primary seal in the “Volume-Maximizing Seal”.

              § 60.113b
              Testing and procedures.

              The owner or operator of each storage vessel as specified in § 60.112b(a) shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section. The applicable paragraph for a particular storage vessel depends on the control equipment installed to meet the requirements of § 60.112b.
              (a) After installing the control equipment required to meet § 60.112b(a)(1) (permanently affixed roof and internal floating roof), each owner or operator shall:
              (1) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service), prior to filling the storage vessel with VOL. If there are holes, tears, or other openings in the primary seal, the secondary seal, or the seal fabric or defects in the internal floating roof, or both, the owner or operator shall repair the items before filling the storage vessel.
              (2) For Vessels equipped with a liquid-mounted or mechanical shoe primary seal, visually inspect the internal floating roof and the primary seal or the secondary seal (if one is in service) through manholes and roof hatches on the fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial fill. If the internal floating roof is not resting on the surface of the VOL inside the storage vessel, or there is liquid accumulated on the roof, or the seal is detached, or there are holes or tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days. If a failure that is detected during inspections required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, a 30-day extension may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report required in § 60.115b(a)(3). Such a request for an extension must document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable and specify a schedule of actions the company will take that will assure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
              (3) For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in § 60.112b(a)(1)(ii)(B):
              (i) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section at least every 5 years; or
              (ii) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (4) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes and sleeve seals (if any) each time the storage vessel is emptied and degassed. If the internal floating roof has defects, the primary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the gaskets no longer close off the liquid surfaces from the atmosphere, or the slotted membrane has more than 10 percent open area, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before refilling the storage vessel with VOL. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of vessels conducting the annual visual inspection as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section and at intervals no greater than 5 years in the case of vessels specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
              (5) Notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to the filling or refilling of each storage vessel for which an inspection is required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(4) of this section to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If the inspection required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance or refilling the tank, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, this notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling.

              (b) After installing the control equipment required to meet § 60.112b(a)(2) (external floating roof), the owner or operator shall:
              (1) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths, between the primary seal and the wall of the storage vessel and between the secondary seal and the wall of the storage vessel according to the following frequency.
              (i) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic testing of the vessel or within 60 days of the initial fill with VOL and at least once every 5 years thereafter.
              (ii) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the secondary seal shall be performed within 60 days of the initial fill with VOL and at least once per year thereafter.
              (iii) If any source ceases to store VOL for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of VOL into the vessel shall be considered an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (2) Determine gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary seals individually by the following procedures:
              (i) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
              (ii) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the tank in each place where a 0.32-cm diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and the wall of the storage vessel and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
              (iii) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the tank wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
              (3) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually and divide the sum for each seal by the nominal diameter of the tank and compare each ratio to the respective standards in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (4) Make necessary repairs or empty the storage vessel within 45 days of identification in any inspection for seals not meeting the requirements listed in (b)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section:
              (i) The accumulated area of gaps between the tank wall and the mechanical shoe or liquid-mounted primary seal shall not exceed 212 cm2 per meter of tank diameter, and the width of any portion of any gap shall not exceed 3.81 cm.
              (A) One end of the mechanical shoe is to extend into the stored liquid, and the other end is to extend a minimum vertical distance of 61 cm above the stored liquid surface.
              (B) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the shoe, seal fabric, or seal envelope.
              (ii) The secondary seal is to meet the following requirements:
              (A) The secondary seal is to be installed above the primary seal so that it completely covers the space between the roof edge and the tank wall except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
              (B) The accumulated area of gaps between the tank wall and the secondary seal shall not exceed 21.2 cm2 per meter of tank diameter, and the width of any portion of any gap shall not exceed 1.27 cm.
              (C) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or seal fabric.
              (iii) If a failure that is detected during inspections required in paragraph (b)(1) of § 60.113b(b) cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, a 30-day extension may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report required in § 60.115b(b)(4). Such extension request must include a demonstration of unavailability of alternate storage capacity and a specification of a schedule that will assure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
              (5) Notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of any gap measurements required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present.

              (6) Visually inspect the external floating roof, the primary seal, secondary seal, and fittings each time the vessel is emptied and degassed.
              
              (i) If the external floating roof has defects, the primary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before filling or refilling the storage vessel with VOL.
              (ii) For all the inspections required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to the filling or refilling of each storage vessel to afford the Administrator the opportunity to inspect the storage vessel prior to refilling. If the inspection required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the tank, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, this notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling.
              (c) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a closed vent system and control device as required in § 60.112b (a)(3) or (b)(2) (other than a flare) is exempt from § 60.8 of the General Provisions and shall meet the following requirements.
              (1) Submit for approval by the Administrator as an attachment to the notification required by § 60.7(a)(1) or, if the facility is exempt from § 60.7(a)(1), as an attachment to the notification required by § 60.7(a)(2), an operating plan containing the information listed below.
              (i) Documentation demonstrating that the control device will achieve the required control efficiency during maximum loading conditions. This documentation is to include a description of the gas stream which enters the control device, including flow and VOC content under varying liquid level conditions (dynamic and static) and manufacturer's design specifications for the control device. If the control device or the closed vent capture system receives vapors, gases, or liquids other than fuels from sources that are not designated sources under this subpart, the efficiency demonstration is to include consideration of all vapors, gases, and liquids received by the closed vent capture system and control device. If an enclosed combustion device with a minimum residence time of 0.75 seconds and a minimum temperature of 816 °C is used to meet the 95 percent requirement, documentation that those conditions will exist is sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph.
              (ii) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to ensure that the control device will be operated in conformance with its design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that parameter (or parameters).
              (2) Operate the closed vent system and control device and monitor the parameters of the closed vent system and control device in accordance with the operating plan submitted to the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the plan was modified by the Administrator during the review process. In this case, the modified plan applies.
              (d) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a closed vent system and a flare to meet the requirements in § 60.112b (a)(3) or (b)(2) shall meet the requirements as specified in the general control device requirements, § 60.18 (e) and (f).

              Monitoring of operations.
              (a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a monitoring device that continually measures and records for each steel production cycle the various rates or levels of exhaust ventilation at each phase of the cycle through each duct of the secondary emission capture system. The monitoring device or devices are to be placed at locations near each capture point of the secondary emission capture system to monitor the exhaust ventilation rates or levels adequately, or in alternative locations approved in advance by the Administrator.
              (b) If a chart recorder is used, the owner or operator shall use chart recorders that are operated at a minimum chart speed of 3.8 cm/hr (1.5 in./hr).
              (c) All monitoring devices required by paragraph (a) of this section are to be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within ±10 percent compared to Method 2 of appendix A of this part. The owner or operator shall recalibrate and check the device(s) annually and at other times as the Administrator may require, in accordance with the written instructions of the manufacturer and by comparing the device against Method 2.

              (d) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall report on a semiannual basis all measurements of exhaust ventilation rates or levels over any 3-hour period that average more than 10 percent below the average rates or levels of exhaust ventilation maintained during the most recent performance test conducted under § 60.8 in which the affected facility demonstrated compliance with the standard under § 60.142a(a)(2). The accuracy of the respective measurements, not to exceed the values specified in paragraph (c) of this section, may be considered when determining the measurement results that must be reported.
              (e) If a scrubber primary emission control device is used to collect secondary emissions, the owner or operator shall report on a semiannual basis all measurements of exhaust ventilation rate over any 3-hour period that average more than 10 percent below the average levels maintained during the most recent performance test conducted under § 60.8 in which the affected facility demonstrated compliance with the standard under § 60.142(a)(1).

              § 60.144a
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).
              (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.142a as follows:
              (1) Start and end times of each steel production cycle during each run shall be recorded (see § 60.145a (c) and (d) for the definitions of start and end times of a cycle).
              (2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration. Sampling shall be conducted only during the steel production cycle and for a sufficient number of steel production cycles to obtain a total sample volume of at least 5.67 dscm (200 dscf) for each run.
              (3) Method 9 and the procedures of § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity, except sections 2.4 and 2.5 of Method 9 shall be replaced with the following instructions for recording observations and reducing data:
              (i) Section 2.4. Opacity observations shall be recorded to the nearest 5 percent at 15-second intervals. During the initial performance test conducted pursuant to § 60.8, observations shall be made and recorded in this manner for a minimum of three steel production cycles. During any subsequent compliance test, observations may be made for any number of steel production cycles, although, where conditions permit, observations will generally be made for a minimum of three steel production cycles.
              (ii) Section 2.5. Opacity shall be determined as an average of 12 consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals. For each steel production cycle, divide the observations recorded into sets of 12 consecutive observations. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and in no case shall two sets overlap. For each set of 12 observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of 12 consecutive observations and dividing this sum by 12.
              (c) In complying with the requirements of § 60.143a(c), the owner or operator shall conduct an initial test as follows:
              (1) For devices that monitor and record the exhaust ventilation rate, compare velocity readings recorded by the monitoring device against the velocity readings obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 readings at a point or points that would properly characterize the monitoring device's performance and that would adequately reflect the various rates of exhaust ventilation. Obtain readings at sufficient intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings for each duct of the secondary emission capture system. Compare the averages of the two sets to determine whether the monitoring device velocity is within ±10 percent of the Method 2 average.

              (2) For devices that monitor the level of exhaust ventilation and record only step changes when a set point rate is reached, compare step changes recorded by the monitoring device against the velocity readings obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 readings at a point or points that would properly characterize the performance of the monitoring device and that would adequately reflect the various rates of exhaust ventilation. Obtain readings at sufficient intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings for each duct of the secondary emission capture system. Compare the averages of the two sets to determine whether the monitoring device step change is within ±10 percent of the setpoint rate.
              (d) To comply with § 60.143a(d) or (e), the owner or operator shall use the monitoring device of § 60.143a(a) to determine the exhaust ventilation rates or levels during the particulate matter runs. Each owner or operator shall then use these rates or levels to determine the 3-hour averages required by § 60.143a(d) and (e).

              § 60.145a
              Compliance provisions.
              (a) When determining compliance with mass and visible emission limits specified in § 60.142a(a) (2) and (3), the owner or operator of a BOPF shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping cycles may elect to operate only one furnace. If an owner or operator chooses to shut down one furnace, he shall be allowed a reasonable time period to adjust his production schedule before the compliance tests are conducted. The owner or operator of an affected facility may also elect to suspend shop operations not subject to this subpart during compliance testing.
              (b) During compliance testing for mass and visible emission standards, if an owner or operator elects to shut down one furnace in a shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping cycles, the owner or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system for the furnace being tested at exhaust ventilation rates or levels for each duct of the secondary emission control system that are appropriate for single-furnace operation. Following the compliance test, the owner or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system at exhaust ventilation rates or levels for each duct of the system that are no lower than 90 percent of the exhaust ventilation values established during the most recent compliance test.
              (c) For the purpose of determining compliance with visible and mass emission standards, a steel production cycle begins when the scrap or hot metal is charged to the vessel (whichever operation occurs first) and terminates 3 minutes after slag is emptied from the vessel into the slag pot. Consecutive steel production cycles are not required for the purpose of determining compliance. Where a hot metal transfer or skimming station is an affected facility, the steel production cycle also includes the hot metal transfer or skimming operation for the next steel production cycle for the affected vessel. Visible emission observations for both hot metal transfer and skimming operations begin with the start of the operation and terminate 3 minutes after completion of the operation.
              (d) For the purpose of determining compliance with visible emission standards specified in § 60.142a(a) (1) and (3), the starting and stopping times of regulated process operations shall be determined and the starting and stopping times of visible emissions data sets shall be determined accordingly.
              (e) To determine compliance with § 60.142a(a)(1), select the data sets yielding the highest and second highest 3-minute average opacities for each steel production cycle. Compliance is achieved if the highest 3-minute average for each cycle observed is less than 20 percent and the second highest 3-minute average is 10 percent or less.
              (f) To determine compliance with § 60.142(a)(2), determine the concentration of particulate matter in exhaust gases exiting the secondary emission collection device with Method 5. Compliance is achieved if the concentration of particulate matter does not exceed 23 mg/dscm (0.010 gr/dscf).
              (g) To determine compliance with § 60.142a(a)(3), construct consecutive 3-minute averages for each steel production cycle. Compliance is achieved if no 3-minute average is more than 5 percent.

              (1) The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system (CMS) that continuously measures and permanently records the pressure at the gas stream inlet and outlet of the absorber. The pressure at the gas stream inlet of the absorber may be measured using amperage on the blower if a correlation between pressure and amperage is established.
              
              (2) The CMS must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over the normal range measured or 0.12 kilopascals (0.5 inches of water column), whichever is greater.
              (3) The owner or operator shall establish an allowable range for the pressure drop through the absorber. The allowable range is ±20 percent of the arithmetic average of the three test runs conducted during the performance test required in § 60.8. The Administrator retains the right to reduce the ±20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard. However, the adjustment must not be reduced to less than ±10 percent under any instance.
              (4) The owner or operator shall demonstrate continuous compliance by maintaining the daily average pressure drop through the absorber to within the allowable range established in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The daily average pressure drop through the absorber for each operating day shall be calculated using the data recorded by the monitoring system. If the emissions unit operation is continuous, the operating day is a 24-hour period. If the emissions unit operation is not continuous, the operating day is the total number of hours of control device operation per 24-hour period. Valid data points must be available for 75 percent of the operating hours in an operating day to compute the daily average.

              (a) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged in to the atmosphere from any electric submerged arc furnace any gases which contain, on a dry basis, 20 or greater volume percent of carbon monoxide. Combustion of such gases under conditions acceptable to the Administrator constitutes compliance with this section. Acceptable conditions include, but are not limited to, flaring of gases or use of gases as fuel for other processes.
            
            
              § 60.264
              Emission monitoring.
              (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous monitoring system for measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s).

              § 60.265
              Monitoring of operations.
              (a) The owner or operator of any electric submerged arc furnace subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain daily records of the following information:
              (1) Product being produced.
              (2) Description of constituents of furnace charge, including the quantity, by weight.
              (3) Time and duration of each tapping period and the identification of material tapped (slag or product.)
              (4) All furnace power input data obtained under paragraph (b) of this section.
              (5) All flow rate data obtained under paragraph (c) of this section or all fan motor power consumption and pressure drop data obtained under paragraph (e) of this section.

              (b) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to measure and continuously record the furnace power input. The furnace power input may be measured at the output or input side of the transformer. The device must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over its operating range.
              
              (c) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously measures and records the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood of the capture system, except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section. The owner or operator of an electric submerged arc furnace that is equipped with a water cooled cover which is designed to contain and prevent escape of the generated gas and particulate matter shall monitor only the volumetric flow rate through the capture system for control of emissions from the tapping station. The owner or operator may install the monitoring device(s) in any appropriate location in the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will result. The flow rate monitoring device must have an accuracy of ±10 percent over its normal operating range and must be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring device relative to Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A to this part.
              (d) When performance tests are conducted under the provisions of § 60.8 of this part to demonstrate compliance with the standards under §§ 60.262(a) (4) and (5), the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood of the capture system must be determined using the monitoring device required under paragraph (c) of this section. The volumetric flow rates must be determined for furnace power input levels at 50 and 100 percent of the nominal rated capacity of the electric submerged arc furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc furnace is operated, the owner or operator shall maintain the volumetric flow rate at or above the appropriate levels for that furnace power input level determined during the most recent performance test. If emissions due to tapping are captured and ducted separately from emissions of the electric submerged arc furnace, during each tapping period the owner or operator shall maintain the exhaust flow rates through the capture system over the tapping station at or above the levels established during the most recent performance test. Operation at lower flow rates may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request that these flow rates be reestablished by conducting new performance tests under § 60.8 of this part.
              (e) The owner or operator may as an alternative to paragraph (c) of this section determine the volumetric flow rate through each fan of the capture system from the fan power consumption, pressure drop across the fan and the fan performance curve. Only data specific to the operation of the affected electric submerged arc furnace are acceptable for demonstration of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph. The owner or operator shall maintain on file a permanent record of the fan performance curve (prepared for a specific temperature) and shall:
              (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to continuously measure and record the power consumption of the fan motor (measured in kilowatts), and
              (2) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to continuously measure and record the pressure drop across the fan. The fan power consumption and pressure drop measurements must be synchronized to allow real time comparisions of the data. The monitoring devices must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over their normal operating ranges.

              (f) The volumetric flow rate through each fan of the capture system must be determined from the fan power consumption, fan pressure drop, and fan performance curve specified under paragraph (e) of this section, during any performance test required under § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with the standards under §§ 60.262(a)(4) and (5). The owner or operator shall determine the volumetric flow rate at a representative temperature for furnace power input levels of 50 and 100 percent of the nominal rated capacity of the electric submerged arc furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc furnace is operated, the owner or operator shall maintain the fan power consumption and fan pressure drop at levels such that the volumetric flow rate is at or above the levels established during the most recent performance test for that furnace power input level. If emissions due to tapping are captured and ducted separately from emissions of the electric submerged arc furnace, during each tapping period the owner or operator shall maintain the fan power consumption and fan pressure drop at levels such that the volumetric flow rate is at or above the levels established during the most recent performance test. Operation at lower flow rates may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request that these flow rates be reestablished by conducting new performance tests under § 60.8. The Administrator may require the owner or operator to verify the fan performance curve by monitoring necessary fan operating parameters and determining the gas volume moved relative to Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A to this part.
              (g) All monitoring devices required under paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section are to be checked for calibration annually in accordance with the procedures under § 60.13(b).
            
            
              § 60.266
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) During any performance test required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall not allow gaseous diluents to be added to the effluent gas stream after the fabric in an open pressurized fabric filter collector unless the total gas volume flow from the collector is accurately determined and considered in the determination of emissions.
              (b) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).
              (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.262 as follows:

              (2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration (csi) and volumetric flow rate (Qsdi) of the effluent gas, except that the heating systems specified in sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.6 are not to be used when the carbon monoxide content of the gas stream exceeds 10 percent by volume, dry basis. If a flare is used to comply with § 60.263, the sampling site shall be upstream of the flare. The sampling time shall include an integral number of furnace cycles.
              (i) When sampling emissions from open electric submerged arc furnaces with wet scrubber control devices, sealed electric submerged arc furnaces, or semienclosed electric arc furnaces, the sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 1.80 dscm (63.6 dscf).
              (ii) When sampling emissions from other types of installations, the sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 200 minutes and 5.66 dscm (200 dscf).
              (3) The measurement device of § 60.265(b) shall be used to determine the average furnace power input (P) during each run.
              (4) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
              (5) The emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine the CO concentration. The sample shall be taken simultaneously with each particulate matter sample.

              (d) During the particulate matter run, the maximum open hood area (in hoods with segmented or otherwise moveable sides) under which the process is expected to be operated and remain in compliance with all standards shall be recorded. Any future operation of the hooding system with open areas in excess of the maximum is not permitted.
              (e) To comply with § 60.265 (d) or (f), the owner or operator shall use the monitoring devices in § 60.265 (c) or (e) to make the required measurements as determined during the performance test.

              § 60.273
              Emission monitoring.
              (a) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (b) For the purpose of reports under § 60.7(c), all six-minute periods during which the average opacity is three percent or greater shall indicate a period of excess emission, and shall be reported to the Administrator semi-annually.

              (c) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s) is not required on any modular, multi-stack, negative-pressure or positive-pressure fabric filter if observations of the opacity of the visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible emission observer; or on any single-stack fabric filter if visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible emission observer and the owner installs and continuously operates a bag leak detection system according to paragraph (e) of this section. Visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once per day for at least three 6-minute periods when the furnace is operating in the melting and refining period. All visible emissions observations shall be conducted in accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to this part. If visible emissions occur from more than one point, the opacity shall be recorded for any points where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of the visible emission, only one set of three 6-minute observations will be required. In that case, the Method 9 observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average that is in excess of the emission limit specified in § 60.272(a).
              (d) A furnace static pressure monitoring device is not required on any EAF equipped with a DEC system if observations of shop opacity are performed by a certified visible emission observer as follows: Shop opacity observations shall be conducted at least once per day when the furnace is operating in the meltdown and refining period. Shop opacity shall be determined as the arithmetic average of 24 or more consecutive 15-second opacity observations of emissions from the shop taken in accordance with Method 9. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any point(s) where visible emissions are observed in proximity to an affected EAF. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of visible emissions, only one observation of shop opacity will be required. In this case, the shop opacity observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident.
              (e) A bag leak detection system must be installed and continuously operated on all single-stack fabric filters if the owner or operator elects not to install and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section. In addition, the owner or operator shall meet the visible emissions observation requirements in paragraph (c) of this section. The bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this section.
              (1) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.

              (2) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative particulate matter loadings and the owner or operator shall continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger.)
              (3) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loading is detected over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
              (4) For each bag leak detection system required by paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated authority, for approval, a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the items identified in paragraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph (e)(4). For each bag leak detection system that operates based on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan shall be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance” (EPA-454/R-98-015). The owner or operator shall operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. The plan shall describe:
              (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
              (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system including how the alarm set-point will be established;
              (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality assurance procedures;
              (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list; and
              (v) How the bag leak detection system output shall be recorded and stored.

              (5) The initial adjustment of the system shall, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time (if applicable).
              (6) Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator shall not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as provided for in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects including temperature and humidity according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required under paragraphs (e)(4) of this section.
              (ii) If opacities greater than zero percent are observed over four consecutive 15-second observations during the daily opacity observations required under paragraph (c) of this section and the alarm on the bag leak detection system does not sound, the owner or operator shall lower the alarm set point on the bag leak detection system to a point where the alarm would have sounded during the period when the opacity observations were made.
              (7) For negative pressure, induced air baghouses, and positive pressure baghouses that are discharged to the atmosphere through a stack, the bag leak detection sensor must be installed downstream of the baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.
              (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
              (f) For each bag leak detection system installed according to paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall initiate procedures to determine the cause of all alarms within 1 hour of an alarm. Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, the cause of the alarm must be alleviated within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:
              (1) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in particulate emissions;
              (2) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
              (3) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device;
              (4) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment;
              (5) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system; or
              (6) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.
              (g) In approving the site-specific monitoring plan required in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners or operators more than 3 hours to alleviate specific conditions that cause an alarm if the owner or operator identifies the condition that could lead to an alarm in the monitoring plan, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate the condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred, and demonstrates that the requested additional time will ensure alleviation of the condition as expeditiously as practicable.

              § 60.274
              Monitoring of operations.
              (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain records daily of the following information:
              (1) Time and duration of each charge;
              (2) Time and duration of each tap;
              (3) All flow rate data obtained under paragraph (b) of this section, or equivalent obtained under paragraph (d) of this section; and
              (4) All pressure data obtained under paragraph (f) of this section.

              (b) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall check and record on a once-per-shift basis furnace static pressure (if a DEC system is in use, and a furnace static pressure gauge is installed according to paragraph (f) of this section) and either: check and record the control system fan motor amperes and damper positions on a once-per-shift basis; install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood; or install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the control device inlet and check and record damper positions on a once-per-shift basis. The monitoring device(s) may be installed in any appropriate location in the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will result. The flow rate monitoring device(s) shall have an accuracy of ±10 percent over its normal operating range and shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring device(s) relative to Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A of this part.
              (c) When the owner or operator of an affected facility is required to demonstrate compliance with the standards under § 60.272(a)(3) and at any other time that the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the CAA, as amended) either: the control system fan motor amperes and all damper positions, the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood, or the volumetric flow rate at the control device inlet and all damper positions shall be determined during all periods in which a hood is operated for the purpose of capturing emissions from the affected facility subject to paragraph (b) of this section. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of these parameters whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon which the parameters were previously established are no longer applicable. The values of these parameters as determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at the appropriate level for each applicable period. Operation at other than baseline values may be subject to the requirements of § 60.276(a).
              (d) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to approve any alternative method that will provide a continuous record of operation of each emission capture system.
              (e) The owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches). This inspection shall include observations of the physical appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of hole in ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in ductwork, and fan erosion). Any deficiencies shall be noted and proper maintenance performed.
              (f) Except as provided for under § 60.273(d), where emissions during any phase of the heat time are controlled by use of a direct shell evacuation system, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the pressure in the free space inside the EAF. The pressure shall be recorded as 15-minute integrated averages. The monitoring device may be installed in any appropriate location in the EAF or DEC duct prior to the introduction of ambient air such that reproducible results will be obtained. The pressure monitoring device shall have an accuracy of ±5 mm of water gauge over its normal operating range and shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions.

              (g) Except as provided for under § 60.273(d), when the owner or operator of an EAF is required to demonstrate compliance with the standard under § 60.272(a)(3) and at any other time the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the Act, as amended), the pressure in the free space inside the furnace shall be determined during the meltdown and refining period(s) using the monitoring device under paragraph (f) of this section. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of the 15-minute integrated average pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon which the pressures were previously established are no longer applicable. The pressure determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at all times the EAF is operating in a meltdown and refining period. Operation at higher pressures may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility.
              (h) Where the capture system is designed and operated such that all emissions are captured and ducted to a control device, the owner or operator shall not be subject to the requirements of this section.
              (i) During any performance test required under § 60.8, and for any report thereof required by § 60.276(c) of this subpart or to determine compliance with § 60.272(a)(3) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor the following information for all heats covered by the test:
              (1) Charge weights and materials, and tap weights and materials;
              (2) Heat times, including start and stop times, and a log of process operation, including periods of no operation during testing and the pressure inside the furnace where direct-shell evacuation systems are used;
              (3) Control device operation log; and
              (4) Continuous opacity monitor or Method 9 data.

              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) During performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall not add gaseous diluent to the effluent gas after the fabric in any pressurized fabric collector, unless the amount of dilution is separately determined and considered in the determination of emissions.
              (b) When emissions from any EAF(s) are combined with emissions from facilities not subject to the provisions of this subpart but controlled by a common capture system and control device, the owner or operator shall use either or both of the following procedures during a performance test (see also § 60.276(b)):
              (1) Determine compliance using the combined emissions.
              (2) Use a method that is acceptable to the Administrator and that compensates for the emissions from the facilities not subject to the provisions of this subpart.

The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 4 hours and 4.5 dscm (160 dscf) and, when a single EAF is sampled, the sampling time shall include an integral number of heats.
              (2) When more than one control device serves the EAF(s) being tested, the concentration of particulate matter shall be determined using the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.013
              
              
                where:
                
                cst = average concentration of particulate matter, mg/dscm (gr/dscf).
                csi = concentration of particulate matter from control device “i”, mg/dscm (gr/dscf).
                n = total number of control devices tested.
                Qsdi = volumetric flow rate of stack gas from control device “i”, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
              
              

              (3) Method 9 and the procedures of § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
              
              (4) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.272(a) (1), (2), and (3), the Method 9 test runs shall be conducted concurrently with the particulate matter test runs, unless inclement weather interferes.
              (f) To comply with § 60.274 (c), (f), (g), and (i), the owner or operator shall obtain the information in these paragraphs during the particulate matter runs.

              (1) Base compliance on control of the combined emissions.
              (2) Utilize a method acceptable to the Administrator which compensates for the emissions from the facilities not subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (3) Any combination of the criteria of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.

              (3) Any combination of the criteria of paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section.
              (i) If visible emissions observations are made in lieu of using a continuous opacity monitoring system, as allowed for by § 60.273(c), visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once per day for at least three 6-minute periods when the furnace is operating in the melting and refining period. All visible emissions observations shall be conducted in accordance with Method 9. If visible emissions occur from more than one point, the opacity shall be recorded for any points where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of the visible emission, only one set of three 6-minute observations will be required. In that case, the Method 9 observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average that is in excess of the emission limit specified in § 60.272(a).
              (j) Unless the presence of inclement weather makes concurrent testing infeasible, the owner or operator shall conduct concurrently the performance tests required under § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with § 60.272(a) (1), (2), and (3) of this subpart.

              § 60.272a
              Standard for particulate matter.
              (a) On and after the date of which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from an EAF or an AOD vessel any gases which:
              (1) Exit from a control device and contain particulate matter in excess of 12 mg/dscm (0.0052 gr/dscf);
              (2) Exit from a control device and exhibit 3 percent opacity or greater; and

              (b) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the dust-handling system any gases that exhibit 10 percent opacity or greater.
            
            
              § 60.273a
              Emission monitoring.
              (a) Except as provided under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (b) No continuous monitoring system shall be required on any control device serving the dust-handling system.
              (c) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s) is not required on any modular, multi-stack, negative-pressure or positive-pressure fabric filter if observations of the opacity of the visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible emission observer; or on any single-stack fabric filter if visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible emission observer and the owner installs and continuously operates a bag leak detection system according to paragraph (e) of this section. Visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once per day for at least three 6-minute periods when the furnace is operating in the melting and refining period. All visible emissions observations shall be conducted in accordance with Method 9. If visible emissions occur from more than one point, the opacity shall be recorded for any points where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of the visible emission, only one set of three 6-minute observations will be required. In that case, the Method 9 observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average that is in excess of the emission limit specified in § 60.272a(a).
              (d) A furnace static pressure monitoring device is not required on any EAF equipped with a DEC system if observations of shop opacity are performed by a certified visible emission observer as follows: Shop opacity observations shall be conducted at least once per day when the furnace is operating in the meltdown and refining period. Shop opacity shall be determined as the arithmetic average of 24 consecutive 15-second opacity observations of emissions from the shop taken in accordance with Method 9. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any point(s) where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of visible emissions, only one observation of shop opacity will be required. In this case, the shop opacity observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident.

              (e) A bag leak detection system must be installed and continuously operated on all single-stack fabric filters if the owner or operator elects not to install and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section. In addition, the owner or operator shall meet the visible emissions observation requirements in paragraph (c) of this section. The bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (8) of this section.
              (1) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.

              (2) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative particulate matter loadings and the owner or operator shall continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger.)
              (3) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loading is detected over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
              (4) For each bag leak detection system required by paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall develop and submit to the Administrator or delegated authority, for approval, a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the items identified in paragraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph (e)(4). For each bag leak detection system that operates based on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan shall be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance” (EPA-454/R-98-015). The owner or operator shall operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. The plan shall describe the following:
              (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
              (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system including how the alarm set-point will be established;
              (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality assurance procedures;
              (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list; and
              (v) How the bag leak detection system output shall be recorded and stored.
              (5) The initial adjustment of the system shall, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time (if applicable).
              (6) Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator shall not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as provided for in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects including temperature and humidity according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required under paragraphs (e)(4) of this section.
              (ii) If opacities greater than zero percent are observed over four consecutive 15-second observations during the daily opacity observations required under paragraph (c) of this section and the alarm on the bag leak detection system does not sound, the owner or operator shall lower the alarm set point on the bag leak detection system to a point where the alarm would have sounded during the period when the opacity observations were made.
              (7) For negative pressure, induced air baghouses, and positive pressure baghouses that are discharged to the atmosphere through a stack, the bag leak detection sensor must be installed downstream of the baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.
              (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.

              (f) For each bag leak detection system installed according to paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall initiate procedures to determine the cause of all alarms within 1 hour of an alarm. Except as provided for under paragraph (g) of this section, the cause of the alarm must be alleviated within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
              (1) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in particulate emissions;
              (2) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
              (3) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device;
              (4) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment;
              (5) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system; and
              (6) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.
              (g) In approving the site-specific monitoring plan required in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the Administrator or delegated authority may allow owners or operators more than 3 hours to alleviate specific conditions that cause an alarm if the owner or operator identifies the condition that could lead to an alarm in the monitoring plan, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate the condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred, and demonstrates that the requested additional time will ensure alleviation of the condition as expeditiously as practicable.

              § 60.274a
              Monitoring of operations.
              (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain records of the following information:
              (1) All data obtained under paragraph (b) of this section; and
              (2) All monthly operational status inspections performed under paragraph (c) of this section.
              (b) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall check and record on a once-per-shift basis the furnace static pressure (if DEC system is in use, and a furnace static pressure gauge is installed according to paragraph (f) of this section) and either: check and record the control system fan motor amperes and damper position on a once-per-shift basis; install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood; or install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the control device inlet and check and record damper positions on a once-per-shift basis. The monitoring device(s) may be installed in any appropriate location in the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will result. The flow rate monitoring device(s) shall have an accuracy of ±10 percent over its normal operating range and shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring device(s) relative to Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A of this part.

              (c) When the owner or operator of an affected facility is required to demonstrate compliance with the standards under § 60.272a(a)(3) and at any other time that the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the CAA, as amended) either: the control system fan motor amperes and all damper positions, the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood, or the volumetric flow rate at the control device inlet and all damper positions shall be determined during all periods in which a hood is operated for the purpose of capturing emissions from the affected facility subject to paragraph (b) of this section. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of these parameters whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected facility operating conditions upon which the parameters were previously established are no longer applicable. The values of these parameters as determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at the appropriate level for each applicable period. Operation at other than baseline values may be subject to the requirements of § 60.276a(c).

              (d) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches). This inspection shall include observations of the physical appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in ductwork, and fan erosion). Any deficiencies shall be noted and proper maintenance performed.
              (e) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to approve any alternative to either the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section or the monthly operational status inspections specified in paragraph (d) of this section if the alternative will provide a continuous record of operation of each emission capture system.
              (f) Except as provided for under § 60.273a(d), if emissions during any phase of the heat time are controlled by the use of a DEC system, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that allows the pressure in the free space inside the EAF to be monitored. The pressure shall be recorded as 15-minute integrated averages. The monitoring device may be installed in any appropriate location in the EAF or DEC duct prior to the introduction of ambient air such that reproducible results will be obtained. The pressure monitoring device shall have an accuracy of ±5 mm of water gauge over its normal operating range and shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions.
              (g) Except as provided for under § 60.273a(d), when the owner or operator of an EAF controlled by a DEC is required to demonstrate compliance with the standard under § 60.272a(a)(3), and at any other time the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, as amended), the pressure in the free space inside the furnace shall be determined during the meltdown and refining period(s) using the monitoring device required under paragraph (f) of this section. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of the pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon which the pressures were previously established are no longer applicable. The pressure determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at all times when the EAF is operating in a meltdown and refining period. Operation at higher pressures may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility.
              (h) During any performance test required under § 60.8, and for any report thereof required by § 60.276a(f) of this subpart, or to determine compliance with § 60.272a(a)(3) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor the following information for all heats covered by the test:
              (1) Charge weights and materials, and tap weights and materials;
              (2) Heat times, including start and stop times, and a log of process operation, including periods of no operation during testing and the pressure inside an EAF when direct-shell evacuation control systems are used;
              (3) Control device operation log; and
              (4) Continuous opacity monitor or Method 9 data.

              (3) Method 9 and the procedures of § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
              (4) To demonstrate compliance with § 60.272a(a) (1), (2), and (3), the Method 9 test runs shall be conducted concurrently with the particulate matter test runs, unless inclement weather interferes.
              (f) To comply with § 60.274a (c), (f), (g), and (h), the owner or operator shall obtain the information required in these paragraphs during the particulate matter runs.
              (g) Any control device subject to the provisions of the subpart shall be designed and constructed to allow measurement of emissions using applicable test methods and procedures.

              (i) Where emissions from any EAF(s) or AOD vessel(s) are combined with emissions from facilities not subject to the provisions of this subpart, determinations of compliance with § 60.272a(a)(3) will only be based upon emissions originating from the affected facility(ies).
              (j) Unless the presence of inclement weather makes concurrent testing infeasible, the owner or operator shall conduct concurrently the performance tests required under § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with § 60.272a(a) (1), (2), and (3) of this subpart.

              (b) Each owner or operator shall submit a written report of exceedances of the control device opacity to the Administrator semi-annually. For the purposes of these reports, exceedances are defined as all 6-minute periods during which the average opacity is 3 percent or greater.
              (c) Operation at a furnace static pressure that exceeds the value established under § 60.274a(g) and either operation of control system fan motor amperes at values exceeding ±15 percent of the value established under § 60.274a(c) or operation at flow rates lower than those established under § 60.274a(c) may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. Operation at such values shall be reported to the Administrator semiannually.
              (d) The requirements of this section remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this section, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.

              (1) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart must, except where the provisions of § 60.283a(a)(1)(iii) or (iv) apply, perform the following:
              (i) Calculate and record on a daily basis 12-hour average TRS concentrations for the two consecutive periods of each operating day. Each 12-hour average must be determined as the arithmetic mean of the appropriate 12 contiguous 1-hour average TRS concentrations provided by each continuous monitoring system installed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (ii) Calculate and record on a daily basis 12-hour average oxygen concentrations for the two consecutive periods of each operating day for the recovery furnace and lime kiln. These 12- hour averages must correspond to the 12-hour average TRS concentrations under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and must be determined as an arithmetic mean of the appropriate 12 contiguous 1-hour average oxygen concentrations provided by each continuous monitoring system installed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

              (iii) Using the following equation, correct all 12-hour average TRS concentrations to 10 volume percent oxygen, except that all 12-hour average TRS concentrations from a recovery furnace must be corrected to 8 volume percent oxygen instead of 10 percent, and all 12-hour average TRS concentrations from a facility to which the provisions of § 60.283a(a)(1)(v) apply must not be corrected for oxygen content:
              
              Ccorr = Cmeas × (21−X/21−Y)
              
              
                Where:
                
                Ccorr = the concentration corrected for oxygen.
                Cmeas = the 12-hour average of the measured concentrations uncorrected for oxygen.
                X = the volumetric oxygen concentration in percentage to be corrected to (8 percent for recovery furnaces and 10 percent for lime kilns, incinerators, or other devices).
                Y = the 12-hour average of the measured volumetric oxygen concentration.
              
              

              (2) Record at least once each successive 5-minute period all measurements obtained from the continuous monitoring devices installed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Calculate 3-hour block averages from the recorded measurements of incinerator temperature. Temperature measurements recorded when no TRS emissions are fired in the incinerator (e.g., during incinerator warm-up and cool-down periods when no TRS emissions are generated or an alternative control device is used) may be omitted from the block average calculation.
              (3) Record at least once each successive 15-minute period all measurements obtained from the continuous monitoring devices installed under paragraph (b)(2) through (4) of this section and reduce the data as follows:
              (i) Calculate 12-hour block averages from the recorded measurements of wet scrubber pressure drop (or smelt dissolving tank scrubber fan amperage) and liquid flow rate (or liquid supply pressure), as applicable.
              (ii) Calculate semiannual averages from the recorded measurements of ESP parameters (secondary voltage and secondary current, or total secondary power) for ESP-controlled recovery furnaces or lime kilns that measure opacity in addition to ESP parameters.
              (iii) Calculate 12-hour block averages from the recorded measurements of ESP parameters (secondary voltage and secondary current, or total secondary power) for recovery furnaces or lime kilns with combination ESP/wet scrubber controls.
              (4) During the initial performance test required in § 60.285a, the owner or operator must establish site-specific operating limits for the monitoring parameters in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section by continuously monitoring the parameters and determining the arithmetic average value of each parameter during the performance test. The arithmetic average of the measured values for the three test runs establishes your minimum site-specific operating limit for each wet scrubber or ESP parameter. Multiple performance tests may be conducted to establish a range of parameter values. The owner or operator may establish replacement operating limits for the monitoring parameters during subsequent performance tests using the test methods in § 60.285a.
              (5) You must operate the continuous monitoring systems required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section to collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected facility is operating except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments.
              (6) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating limits. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
              (7) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required quality monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments), failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements.
              (d) Excess emissions are defined for this subpart as follows:

              (3) The 12-hour average TRS concentration uncorrected for oxygen may be considered when determining compliance with the excess emission provisions in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (iii) of this section during periods of startup or shutdown when the 12-hour average stack oxygen percentage approaches ambient conditions. If the 12-hour average TRS concentration uncorrected for oxygen is less than the applicable limit (5 ppm for recovery furnaces or 8 ppm for lime kilns) during periods of startup or shutdown when the 12-hour average stack oxygen concentration is 15 percent or greater, then the Administrator will consider the TRS average to be in compliance. This provision only applies during periods of affected facility startup and shutdown.
              (f) The procedures under § 60.13 must be followed for installation, evaluation, and operation of the continuous monitoring systems required under this section.

Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (f) of this section. Section 60.8(c) must be read as follows for purposes of this subpart: Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to the plant operator based on representative performance of the affected facility. The owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.
              (b) The owner or operator must determine compliance with the filterable particulate matter standards in § 60.282a(a)(1), (2), (5) and (6) as follows:
              (1) Method 5 of appendix A-3 of this part must be used to determine the filterable particulate matter concentration. The sampling time and sample volume for each run must be at least 60 minutes and 0.90 dscm (31.8 dscf). Water must be used as the cleanup solvent instead of acetone in the sample recovery procedure. The particulate concentration must be corrected to the appropriate oxygen concentration according to § 60.284a(c)(3).
              (2) The emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B of appendix A-2 of this part must be used to determine the oxygen concentration. The gas sample must be taken at the same time and at the same traverse points as the particulate sample.

              (3) Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11 must be used to determine opacity. Opacity measurement is not required for recovery furnaces or lime kilns operating with a wet scrubber alone or a wet scrubber in combination with an ESP.
              
              (4) In addition to the initial performance test required by this subpart and § 60.8(a), you must conduct repeat performance tests for filterable particulate matter at intervals no longer than 5 years following the previous performance test using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

              E = csQsd/BLS
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = emission rate of filterable particulate matter, g/kg (lb/ton) of BLS.
                cs = Concentration of filterable particulate matter, g/dscm (lb/dscf).
                Qsd = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dry standard cubic meter per hour (dscm/hr) (dry standard cubic feet per hour (dscf/hr)).
                BLS = black liquor solids (dry weight) feed rate, kg/hr (ton/hr).
              
              

              (2) Method 5 of appendix A-3 of this part must be used to determine the filterable particulate matter concentration (cs) and the volumetric flow rate (Qsd) of the effluent gas.

                2
                CO
                3)
              
              
                Where:
                
                GLS = green liquor sulfidity, percent.

                  S = concentration of Na2S as Na2O, milligrams per liter (mg/L) (grains per gallon (gr/gal)).
                CNaOH = concentration of NaOH as Na2O, mg/L (gr/gal).
                CNa
                  2
                  CO
                  3 = concentration of Na2CO3 as Na2O, mg/L (gr/gal).
              
              
              (4) For recovery furnaces and lime kilns, in addition to the initial performance test required in this subpart and § 60.8(a), you must conduct repeat TRS performance tests at intervals no longer than 5 years following the previous performance test using the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

              (e) The owner or operator must determine compliance with the TRS standards in § 60.283a(a)(1)(vi) and (4) as follows:
              

              (1) The emission rate (E) of TRS must be computed for each run using the following equation:
              
              E = CTRS F Qsd/P
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = emission rate of TRS, g/kg (lb/ton) of BLS or ADP.
                CTRS = average combined concentration of TRS, ppm.
                F = conversion factor, 0.001417 g H2S/cubic meter (m3)-ppm (8.846 × 10-8 lb H2S/cubic foot (ft3)-ppm).
                Qsd = volumetric flow rate of stack gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
                P = black liquor solids feed or pulp production rate, kg/hr (ton/hr).
              
              

              (2) Method 16 of appendix A-6 of this part must be used to determine the TRS concentration (CTRS).

              (1) In place of Method 5 of appendix A-3 of this part, Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part may be used if a constant value of 0.009 g/dscm (0.004 gr/dscf) is added to the results of Method 17 and the stack temperature is no greater than 204 °C (400 °F).
              (2) In place of Method 16 of appendix A-6 of this part, Method 16A, 16B, or 16C of appendix A-6 of this part may be used.
              (3) In place of Method 3B of appendix A-2 of this part, ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) may be used.
            
            
              § 60.286a
              Affirmative defense for violations of emission standards during malfunction.
              In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in §§ 60.282a and 60.283a, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at § 60.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense must not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
              (a) Assertion of affirmative defense. To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, you must timely meet the reporting requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (1) The violation:
              (i) Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
              (ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
              (iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
              (iv) Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
              (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation occurred; and
              (3) The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and
              (4) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
              (5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and
              (6) All emission monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and

              (7) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
              
              (8) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
              (9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis must also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
              (b) Report. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense must submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation that explains how it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. This affirmative defense report must be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.

              (2) Records of actions taken during periods of malfunction to minimize emissions in accordance with § 60.11(d), including corrective actions to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control and monitoring equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation.
            
            
              § 60.288a
              Reporting.
              (a) For the purpose of reports required under § 60.7(c), any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart must report semiannually periods of excess emissions defined in § 60.284a(d).

              (b) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (defined in § 60.8) as required by this subpart you must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, required by this subpart to the EPA as follows. You must use the latest version of the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html) existing at the time of the performance test to generate a submission package file, which documents performance test data. You must then submit the file generated by the ERT through the EPA's Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI), which can be accessed by logging in to the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (https://cdx.epa.gov/). Only data collected using test methods supported by the ERT as listed on the ERT Web site are subject to the requirement to submit the performance test data electronically. Owners or operators who claim that some of the information being submitted for performance tests is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk, flash drive, or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (b). At the discretion of the delegated authority, you must also submit these reports, including the CBI, to the delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated authority. For any performance test conducted using test methods that are not listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 60.4.
              (c) Within 60 days after the date of completing each CEMS performance evaluation test as defined in § 60.13, you must submit relative accuracy test audit (RATA) data to the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) by using CEDRI in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Only RATA pollutants that can be documented with the ERT (as listed on the ERT Web site) are subject to this requirement. For any performance evaluations with no corresponding RATA pollutants listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance evaluation to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 60.4.
              (d) If a malfunction occurred during the reporting period, you must submit a report that contains the following:

              (b) The owner or operator of any stationary gas turbine that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification after October 3, 1977, but before July 8, 2004, and which uses water or steam injection to control NOX emissions may, as an alternative to operating the continuous monitoring system described in paragraph (a) of this section, install, certify, maintain, operate, and quality-assure a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) consisting of NOX and O2 monitors. As an alternative, a CO2 monitor may be used to adjust the measured NOX concentrations to 15 percent O2 by either converting the CO2 hourly averages to equivalent O2 concentrations using Equation F-14a or F-14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter and making the adjustments to 15 percent O2, or by using the CO2 readings directly to make the adjustments, as described in Method 20. If the option to use a CEMS is chosen, the CEMS shall be installed, certified, maintained and operated as follows:

              (1) Each CEMS must be installed and certified according to PS 2 and 3 (for diluent) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, except the 7-day calibration drift is based on unit operating days, not calendar days. Appendix F, Procedure 1 is not required. The relative accuracy test audit (RATA) of the NOX and diluent monitors may be performed individually or on a combined basis, i.e., the relative accuracy tests of the CEMS may be performed either:
              (i) On a ppm basis (for NOX) and a percent O2 basis for oxygen; or
              (ii) On a ppm at 15 percent O2 basis; or
              (iii) On a ppm basis (for NOX) and a percent CO2 basis (for a CO2 monitor that uses the procedures in Method 20 to correct the NOX data to 15 percent O2).

              (2) As specified in § 60.13(e)(2), during each full unit operating hour, each monitor must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute quadrant of the hour, to validate the hour. For partial unit operating hours, at least one valid data point must be obtained for each quadrant of the hour in which the unit operates. For unit operating hours in which required quality assurance and maintenance activities are performed on the CEMS, a minimum of two valid data points (one in each of two quadrants) are required to validate the hour.
              (3) For purposes of identifying excess emissions, CEMS data must be reduced to hourly averages as specified in § 60.13(h).

              (i) For each unit operating hour in which a valid hourly average, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is obtained for both NOX and diluent, the data acquisition and handling system must calculate and record the hourly NOX emissions in the units of the applicable NOX emission standard under § 60.332(a), i.e., percent NOX by volume, dry basis, corrected to 15 percent O2 and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard conditions (if required as given in § 60.335(b)(1)). For any hour in which the hourly average O2 concentration exceeds 19.0 percent O2, a diluent cap value of 19.0 percent O2 may be used in the emission calculations.

              (ii) A worst case ISO correction factor may be calculated and applied using historical ambient data. For the purpose of this calculation, substitute the maximum humidity of ambient air (Ho), minimum ambient temperature (Ta), and minimum combustor inlet absolute pressure (Po) into the ISO correction equation.
              (iii) If the owner or operator has installed a NOX CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, and is continuing to meet the ongoing requirements of part 75 of this chapter, the CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, except that the missing data substitution methodology provided for at 40 CFR part 75, subpart D, is not required for purposes of identifying excess emissions. Instead, periods of missing CEMS data are to be reported as monitor downtime in the excess emissions and monitoring performance report required in § 60.7(c).

              (c) For any turbine that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification after October 3, 1977, but before July 8, 2004, and which does not use steam or water injection to control NOX emissions, the owner or operator may, but is not required to, for purposes of determining excess emissions, use a CEMS that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Also, if the owner or operator has previously submitted and received EPA, State, or local permitting authority approval of a procedure for monitoring compliance with the applicable NOX emission limit under § 60.332, that approved procedure may continue to be used.

              (d) The owner or operator of any new turbine constructed after July 8, 2004, and which uses water or steam injection to control NOX emissions may elect to use either the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section for continuous water or steam to fuel ratio monitoring or may use a NOX CEMS installed, certified, operated, maintained, and quality-assured as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

              (e) The owner or operator of any new turbine that commences construction after July 8, 2004, and which does not use water or steam injection to control NOX emissions, may, but is not required to, elect to use a NOX CEMS installed, certified, operated, maintained, and quality-assured as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Other acceptable monitoring approaches include periodic testing approved by EPA or the State or local permitting authority or continuous parameter monitoring as described in paragraph (f) of this section.

              (f) The owner or operator of a new turbine that commences construction after July 8, 2004, which does not use water or steam injection to control NOX emissions may, but is not required to, perform continuous parameter monitoring as follows:

              (1) For a diffusion flame turbine without add-on selective catalytic reduction controls (SCR), the owner or operator shall define at least four parameters indicative of the unit's NOX formation characteristics and shall monitor these parameters continuously.

              (2) For any lean premix stationary combustion turbine, the owner or operator shall continuously monitor the appropriate parameters to determine whether the unit is operating in low-NOX mode.
              (3) For any turbine that uses SCR to reduce NOX emissions, the owner or operator shall continuously monitor appropriate parameters to verify the proper operation of the emission controls.

              (4) For affected units that are also regulated under part 75 of this chapter, if the owner or operator elects to monitor NOX emission rate using the methodology in appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, or the low mass emissions methodology in § 75.19 of this chapter, the requirements of this paragraph (f) may be met by performing the parametric monitoring described in section 2.3 of appendix E or in § 75.19(c)(1)(iv)(H) of this chapter.

              (g) The steam or water to fuel ratio or other parameters that are continuously monitored as described in paragraphs (a), (d) or (f) of this section shall be monitored during the performance test required under § 60.8, to establish acceptable values and ranges. The owner or operator may supplement the performance test data with engineering analyses, design specifications, manufacturer's recommendations and other relevant information to define the acceptable parametric ranges more precisely. The owner or operator shall develop and keep on-site a parameter monitoring plan which explains the procedures used to document proper operation of the NOX emission controls. The plan shall include the parameter(s) monitored and the acceptable range(s) of the parameter(s) as well as the basis for designating the parameter(s) and acceptable range(s). Any supplemental data such as engineering analyses, design specifications, manufacturer's recommendations and other relevant information shall be included in the monitoring plan. For affected units that are also subject to part 75 of this chapter and that use the low mass emissions methodology in § 75.19 of this chapter or the NOX emission measurement methodology in appendix E to part 75, the owner or operator may meet the requirements of this paragraph by developing and keeping on-site (or at a central location for unmanned facilities) a quality-assurance plan, as described in § 75.19 (e)(5) or in section 2.3 of appendix E and section 1.3.6 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.
              (h) The owner or operator of any stationary gas turbine subject to the provisions of this subpart:
              (1) Shall monitor the total sulfur content of the fuel being fired in the turbine, except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section. The sulfur content of the fuel must be determined using total sulfur methods described in § 60.335(b)(10). Alternatively, if the total sulfur content of the gaseous fuel during the most recent performance test was less than 0.4 weight percent (4000 ppmw), ASTM D4084-82, 94, D5504-01, D6228-98, or Gas Processors Association Standard 2377-86 (all of which are incorporated by reference-see § 60.17), which measure the major sulfur compounds may be used; and

              (2) Shall monitor the nitrogen content of the fuel combusted in the turbine, if the owner or operator claims an allowance for fuel bound nitrogen (i.e., if an F-value greater than zero is being or will be used by the owner or operator to calculate STD in § 60.332). The nitrogen content of the fuel shall be determined using methods described in § 60.335(b)(9) or an approved alternative.
              (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the owner or operator may elect not to monitor the total sulfur content of the gaseous fuel combusted in the turbine, if the gaseous fuel is demonstrated to meet the definition of natural gas in § 60.331(u), regardless of whether an existing custom schedule approved by the administrator for subpart GG requires such monitoring. The owner or operator shall use one of the following sources of information to make the required demonstration:
              (i) The gas quality characteristics in a current, valid purchase contract, tariff sheet or transportation contract for the gaseous fuel, specifying that the maximum total sulfur content of the fuel is 20.0 grains/100 scf or less; or

              (ii) Representative fuel sampling data which show that the sulfur content of the gaseous fuel does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf. At a minimum, the amount of fuel sampling data specified in section 2.3.1.4 or 2.3.2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter is required.
              
              (4) For any turbine that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification after October 3, 1977, but before July 8, 2004, and for which a custom fuel monitoring schedule has previously been approved, the owner or operator may, without submitting a special petition to the Administrator, continue monitoring on this schedule.
              (i) The frequency of determining the sulfur and nitrogen content of the fuel shall be as follows:
              (1) Fuel oil. For fuel oil, use one of the total sulfur sampling options and the associated sampling frequency described in sections 2.2.3, 2.2.4.1, 2.2.4.2, and 2.2.4.3 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter (i.e., flow proportional sampling, daily sampling, sampling from the unit's storage tank after each addition of fuel to the tank, or sampling each delivery prior to combining it with fuel oil already in the intended storage tank). If an emission allowance is being claimed for fuel-bound nitrogen, the nitrogen content of the oil shall be determined and recorded once per unit operating day.
              (2) Gaseous fuel. Any applicable nitrogen content value of the gaseous fuel shall be determined and recorded once per unit operating day. For owners and operators that elect not to demonstrate sulfur content using options in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, and for which the fuel is supplied without intermediate bulk storage, the sulfur content value of the gaseous fuel shall be determined and recorded once per unit operating day.
              (3) Custom schedules. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i)(2) of this section, operators or fuel vendors may develop custom schedules for determination of the total sulfur content of gaseous fuels, based on the design and operation of the affected facility and the characteristics of the fuel supply. Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) and (i)(3)(ii) of this section, custom schedules shall be substantiated with data and shall be approved by the Administrator before they can be used to comply with the standard in § 60.333.
              (i) The two custom sulfur monitoring schedules set forth in paragraphs (i)(3)(i)(A) through (D) and in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section are acceptable, without prior Administrative approval:
              (A) The owner or operator shall obtain daily total sulfur content measurements for 30 consecutive unit operating days, using the applicable methods specified in this subpart. Based on the results of the 30 daily samples, the required frequency for subsequent monitoring of the fuel's total sulfur content shall be as specified in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(B), (C), or (D) of this section, as applicable.
              (B) If none of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total sulfur content exceeds 0.4 weight percent (4000 ppmw), subsequent sulfur content monitoring may be performed at 12 month intervals. If any of the samples taken at 12-month intervals has a total sulfur content between 0.4 and 0.8 weight percent (4000 and 8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C) of this section. If any measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section.
              (C) If at least one of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total sulfur content is between 0.4 and 0.8 weight percent (4000 and 8000 ppmw), but none exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), then:
              (1) Collect and analyze a sample every 30 days for three months. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Otherwise, follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C)(2) of this section.
              (2) Begin monitoring at 6-month intervals for 12 months. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Otherwise, follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C)(3) of this section.
              (3) Begin monitoring at 12-month intervals. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Otherwise, continue to monitor at this frequency.

              (D) If a sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), immediately begin daily monitoring according to paragraph (i)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Daily monitoring shall continue until 30 consecutive daily samples, each having a sulfur content no greater than 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), are obtained. At that point, the applicable procedures of paragraph (i)(3)(i)(B) or (C) of this section shall be followed.
              (ii) The owner or operator may use the data collected from the 720-hour sulfur sampling demonstration described in section 2.3.6 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter to determine a custom sulfur sampling schedule, as follows:

              (A) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from the 720 hourly samples does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf (i.e., the maximum total sulfur content of natural gas as defined in § 60.331(u)), no additional monitoring of the sulfur content of the gas is required, for the purposes of this subpart.
              (B) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from any of the 720 hourly samples exceeds 20 grains/100 scf, but none of the sulfur content values (when converted to weight percent sulfur) exceeds 0.4 weight percent (4000 ppmw), then the minimum required sampling frequency shall be one sample at 12 month intervals.
              (C) If any sample result exceeds 0.4 weight percent sulfur (4000 ppmw), but none exceeds 0.8 weight percent sulfur (8000 ppmw), follow the provisions of paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C) of this section.
              (D) If the sulfur content of any of the 720 hourly samples exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the provisions of paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section.
              (j) For each affected unit that elects to continuously monitor parameters or emissions, or to periodically determine the fuel sulfur content or fuel nitrogen content under this subpart, the owner or operator shall submit reports of excess emissions and monitor downtime, in accordance with § 60.7(c). Excess emissions shall be reported for all periods of unit operation, including startup, shutdown and malfunction. For the purpose of reports required under § 60.7(c), periods of excess emissions and monitor downtime that shall be reported are defined as follows:
              (1) Nitrogen oxides.
              (i) For turbines using water or steam to fuel ratio monitoring:
              (A) An excess emission shall be any unit operating hour for which the average steam or water to fuel ratio, as measured by the continuous monitoring system, falls below the acceptable steam or water to fuel ratio needed to demonstrate compliance with § 60.332, as established during the performance test required in § 60.8. Any unit operating hour in which no water or steam is injected into the turbine shall also be considered an excess emission.
              (B) A period of monitor downtime shall be any unit operating hour in which water or steam is injected into the turbine, but the essential parametric data needed to determine the steam or water to fuel ratio are unavailable or invalid.
              (C) Each report shall include the average steam or water to fuel ratio, average fuel consumption, ambient conditions (temperature, pressure, and humidity), gas turbine load, and (if applicable) the nitrogen content of the fuel during each excess emission. You do not have to report ambient conditions if you opt to use the worst case ISO correction factor as specified in § 60.334(b)(3)(ii), or if you are not using the ISO correction equation under the provisions of § 60.335(b)(1).
              (ii) If the owner or operator elects to take an emission allowance for fuel bound nitrogen, then excess emissions and periods of monitor downtime are as described in paragraphs (j)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
              (A) An excess emission shall be the period of time during which the fuel-bound nitrogen (N) is greater than the value measured during the performance test required in § 60.8 and used to determine the allowance. The excess emission begins on the date and hour of the sample which shows that N is greater than the performance test value, and ends with the date and hour of a subsequent sample which shows a fuel nitrogen content less than or equal to the performance test value.

              (B) A period of monitor downtime begins when a required sample is not taken by its due date. A period of monitor downtime also begins on the date and hour that a required sample is taken, if invalid results are obtained. The period of monitor downtime ends on the date and hour of the next valid sample.
              (iii) For turbines using NOX and diluent CEMS:

              (A) An hour of excess emissions shall be any unit operating hour in which the 4-hour rolling average NOX concentration exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 60.332(a)(1) or (2). For the purposes of this subpart, a “4-hour rolling average NOX concentration” is the arithmetic average of the average NOX concentration measured by the CEMS for a given hour (corrected to 15 percent O2 and, if required under § 60.335(b)(1), to ISO standard conditions) and the three unit operating hour average NOX concentrations immediately preceding that unit operating hour.

              (B) A period of monitor downtime shall be any unit operating hour in which sufficient data are not obtained to validate the hour, for either NOX concentration or diluent (or both).
              (C) Each report shall include the ambient conditions (temperature, pressure, and humidity) at the time of the excess emission period and (if the owner or operator has claimed an emission allowance for fuel bound nitrogen) the nitrogen content of the fuel during the period of excess emissions. You do not have to report ambient conditions if you opt to use the worst case ISO correction factor as specified in § 60.334(b)(3)(ii), or if you are not using the ISO correction equation under the provisions of § 60.335(b)(1).

              (iv) For owners or operators that elect, under paragraph (f) of this section, to monitor combustion parameters or parameters that document proper operation of the NOX emission controls:
              (A) An excess emission shall be a 4-hour rolling unit operating hour average in which any monitored parameter does not achieve the target value or is outside the acceptable range defined in the parameter monitoring plan for the unit.
              (B) A period of monitor downtime shall be a unit operating hour in which any of the required parametric data are either not recorded or are invalid.
              (2) Sulfur dioxide. If the owner or operator is required to monitor the sulfur content of the fuel under paragraph (h) of this section:
              (i) For samples of gaseous fuel and for oil samples obtained using daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling from the unit's storage tank, an excess emission occurs each unit operating hour included in the period beginning on the date and hour of any sample for which the sulfur content of the fuel being fired in the gas turbine exceeds 0.8 weight percent and ending on the date and hour that a subsequent sample is taken that demonstrates compliance with the sulfur limit.

              (ii) If the option to sample each delivery of fuel oil has been selected, the owner or operator shall immediately switch to one of the other oil sampling options (i.e., daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling from the unit's storage tank) if the sulfur content of a delivery exceeds 0.8 weight percent. The owner or operator shall continue to use one of the other sampling options until all of the oil from the delivery has been combusted, and shall evaluate excess emissions according to paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section. When all of the fuel from the delivery has been burned, the owner or operator may resume using the as-delivered sampling option.
              (iii) A period of monitor downtime begins when a required sample is not taken by its due date. A period of monitor downtime also begins on the date and hour of a required sample, if invalid results are obtained. The period of monitor downtime shall include only unit operating hours, and ends on the date and hour of the next valid sample.
              (3) Ice fog. Each period during which an exemption provided in § 60.332(f) is in effect shall be reported in writing to the Administrator quarterly. For each period the ambient conditions existing during the period, the date and time the air pollution control system was deactivated, and the date and time the air pollution control system was reactivated shall be reported. All quarterly reports shall be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter.
              
              (4) Emergency fuel. Each period during which an exemption provided in § 60.332(k) is in effect shall be included in the report required in § 60.7(c). For each period, the type, reasons, and duration of the firing of the emergency fuel shall be reported.
              (5) All reports required under § 60.7(c) shall be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each 6-month period.
              [44 FR 52798, Sept. 10, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 3770, Jan. 27, 1982; 65 FR 61759, Oct. 17, 2000; 69 FR 41360, July 8, 2004; 71 FR 9457, Feb. 24, 2006]
            
            
              § 60.335
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance tests required in § 60.8, using either
              (1) EPA Method 20,
              (2) ASTM D6522-00 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or

              (3) EPA Method 7E and either EPA Method 3 or 3A in appendix A to this part, to determine NOX and diluent concentration.
              (4) Sampling traverse points are to be selected following Method 20 or Method 1, (non-particulate procedures) and sampled for equal time intervals. The sampling shall be performed with a traversing single-hole probe or, if feasible, with a stationary multi-hole probe that samples each of the points sequentially. Alternatively, a multi-hole probe designed and documented to sample equal volumes from each hole may be used to sample simultaneously at the required points.
              (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the owner or operator may test at few points than are specified in Method 1 or Method 20 if the following conditions are met:
              (i) You may perform a stratification test for NOX and diluent pursuant to
              (A) [Reserved]
              (B) The procedures specified in section 6.5.6.1(a) through (e) appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.
              (ii) Once the stratification sampling is completed, the owner or operator may use the following alternative sample point selection criteria for the performance test:
              (A) If each of the individual traverse point NOX concentrations, normalized to 15 percent O2, is within 10 percent of the mean normalized concentration for all traverse points, then you may use 3 points (located either 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the way across the stack or duct, or, for circular stacks or ducts greater than 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the wall). The 3 points shall be located along the measurement line that exhibited the highest average normalized NOX concentration during the stratification test; or
              (B) If each of the individual traverse point NOX concentrations, normalized to 15 percent O2, is within 5 percent of the mean normalized concentration for all traverse points, then you may sample at a single point, located at least 1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid.
              (6) Other acceptable alternative reference methods and procedures are given in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the applicable nitrogen oxides emission limitation in § 60.332 and shall meet the performance test requirements of § 60.8 as follows:

              (1) For each run of the performance test, the mean nitrogen oxides emission concentration (NOXo) corrected to 15 percent O2 shall be corrected to ISO standard conditions using the following equation. Notwithstanding this requirement, use of the ISO correction equation is optional for: Lean premix stationary combustion turbines; units used in association with heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) equipped with duct burners; and units equipped with add-on emission control devices:
              
              NOX = (NOXo)(Pr/Po)0.5 e19 (Ho−0.00633) (288 °K/Ta)1.53
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                NOX = emission concentration of NOX at 15 percent O2 and ISO standard ambient conditions, ppm by volume, dry basis,
                NOXo = mean observed NOX concentration, ppm by volume, dry basis, at 15 percent O2,
                Pr = reference combustor inlet absolute pressure at 101.3 kilopascals ambient pressure. Alternatively, you may use 760 mm Hg (29.92 in Hg),
                Po = observed combustor inlet absolute pressure at test, mm Hg. Alternatively, you may use the barometric pressure for the date of the test,
                Ho = observed humidity of ambient air, g H2O/g air,
                
                e = transcendental constant, 2.718, and
                Ta = ambient temperature, °K.
              
              
              (2) The 3-run performance test required by § 60.8 must be performed within 5 percent at 30, 50, 75, and 90-to-100 percent of peak load or at four evenly-spaced load points in the normal operating range of the gas turbine, including the minimum point in the operating range and 90-to-100 percent of peak load, or at the highest achievable load point if 90-to-100 percent of peak load cannot be physically achieved in practice. If the turbine combusts both oil and gas as primary or backup fuels, separate performance testing is required for each fuel. Notwithstanding these requirements, performance testing is not required for any emergency fuel (as defined in § 60.331).

              (3) For a combined cycle turbine system with supplemental heat (duct burner), the owner or operator may elect to measure the turbine NOX emissions after the duct burner rather than directly after the turbine. If the owner or operator elects to use this alternative sampling location, the applicable NOX emission limit in § 60.332 for the combustion turbine must still be met.
              (4) If water or steam injection is used to control NOX with no additional post-combustion NOX control and the owner or operator chooses to monitor the steam or water to fuel ratio in accordance with § 60.334(a), then that monitoring system must be operated concurrently with each EPA Method 20, ASTM D6522-00 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or EPA Method 7E run and shall be used to determine the fuel consumption and the steam or water to fuel ratio necessary to comply with the applicable § 60.332 NOX emission limit.
              (5) If the owner operator elects to claim an emission allowance for fuel bound nitrogen as described in § 60.332, then concurrently with each reference method run, a representative sample of the fuel used shall be collected and analyzed, following the applicable procedures described in § 60.335(b)(9). These data shall be used to determine the maximum fuel nitrogen content for which the established water (or steam) to fuel ratio will be valid.
              (6) If the owner or operator elects to install a CEMS, the performance evaluation of the CEMS may either be conducted separately (as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) or as part of the initial performance test of the affected unit.

              (7) If the owner or operator elects to install and certify a NOX CEMS under § 60.334(e), then the initial performance test required under § 60.8 may be done in the following alternative manner:
              (i) Perform a minimum of 9 reference method runs, with a minimum time per run of 21 minutes, at a single load level, between 90 and 100 percent of peak (or the highest physically achievable) load.

              (ii) Use the test data both to demonstrate compliance with the applicable NOX emission limit under § 60.332 and to provide the required reference method data for the RATA of the CEMS described under § 60.334(b).
              (iii) The requirement to test at three additional load levels is waived.

              (8) If the owner or operator elects under § 60.334(f) to monitor combustion parameters or parameters indicative of proper operation of NOX emission controls, the appropriate parameters shall be continuously monitored and recorded during each run of the initial performance test, to establish acceptable operating ranges, for purposes of the parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit, as specified in § 60.334(g).
              (9) To determine the fuel bound nitrogen content of fuel being fired (if an emission allowance is claimed for fuel bound nitrogen), the owner or operator may use equipment and procedures meeting the requirements of:

              (i) For liquid fuels, ASTM D2597-94 (Reapproved 1999), D6366-99, D4629-02, D5762-02 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see § 60.17); or
              (ii) For gaseous fuels, shall use analytical methods and procedures that are accurate to within 5 percent of the instrument range and are approved by the Administrator.

              (10) If the owner or operator is required under § 60.334(i)(1) or (3) to periodically determine the sulfur content of the fuel combusted in the turbine, a minimum of three fuel samples shall be collected during the performance test. Analyze the samples for the total sulfur content of the fuel using:

              (i) For liquid fuels, ASTM D129-00, D2622-98, D4294-02, D1266-98, D5453-00 or D1552-01 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see § 60.17); or
              (ii) For gaseous fuels, ASTM D1072-80, 90 (Reapproved 1994); D3246-81, 92, 96; D4468-85 (Reapproved 2000); or D6667-01 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). The applicable ranges of some ASTM methods mentioned above are not adequate to measure the levels of sulfur in some fuel gases. Dilution of samples before analysis (with verification of the dilution ratio) may be used, subject to the prior approval of the Administrator.
              (11) The fuel analyses required under paragraphs (b)(9) and (b)(10) of this section may be performed by the owner or operator, a service contractor retained by the owner or operator, the fuel vendor, or any other qualified agency.
              (c) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
              (1) Instead of using the equation in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, manufacturers may develop ambient condition correction factors to adjust the nitrogen oxides emission level measured by the performance test as provided in § 60.8 to ISO standard day conditions.

              § 60.386
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).
              (b) The owner or operator shall determine complance with the particulate matter standards § 60.382 as follows:
              (1) Method 5 or 17 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration. The sample volume for each run shall be at least 1.70 dscm (60 dscf). The sampling probe and filter holder of Method 5 may be operated without heaters if the gas stream being sampled is at ambient temperature. For gas streams above ambient temperature, the Method 5 sampling train shall be operated with a probe and filter temperature slightly above the effluent temperature (up to a maximum filter temperature of 121 °C (250 °F)) in order to prevent water condensation on the filter.
              (2) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity from stack emissions and process fugitive emissions. The observer shall read opacity only when emissions are clearly identified as emanating solely from the affected facility being observed. A single visible emission observer may conduct visible emission observations for up to three fugitive, stack, or vent emission points within a 15-second interval. This option is subject to the following limitations:
              (i) No more than three emission points are read concurrently;
              (ii) All three emission points must be within a 70° viewing sector or angle in front of the observer such that the proper sun position can be maintained for all three points; and
              (iii) If an opacity reading for any one of the three emission points is within 5 percent opacity of the application standard, then the observer must stop taking readings for the other two points and continue reading just that single point.
              (c) To comply with § 60.385(c), the owner or operator shall use the monitoring devices in § 60.384(a) and (b) to determine the pressure loss of the gas stream through the scrubber and scrubbing liquid flow rate at any time during each particulate matter run, and the average of the three determinations shall be computed.

              (i) Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids for each calendar month for each affected facility. The owner or operator shall determine the composition of the coatings by formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or from data determined by an analysis of each coating, as received, by Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating to determine data used in the calculation of the VOC content of coatings by Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative method. The owner or operator shall determine from company records on a monthly basis the volume of coating consumed, as received, and the mass of solvent used for thinning purposes. The volume weighted average of the total mass of VOC per volume of coating solids used each calendar month will be determined by the following procedures.
              (A) Calculate the mass of VOC used in each calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation where “n” is the total number of coatings used and “m” is the total number of VOC solvents used:

              Then calculate or select the appropriate limit according to § 60.392(a).
              (ii) If the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of applied coating solids (G), calculated on a calendar month basis, is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit specified in § 60.392, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test for the purpose of this subpart.
              (2) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility which uses a capture system and a control device that destroys VOC (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under § 60.392.

              Performance test and compliance provisions.
              (a) The owner or operator of any affected facility (or facilities) shall conduct performance tests in accordance with § 60.8, under the following conditions:
              (1) The performance averaging period for each test is 30 consecutive calendar days and not an average of three separate runs as prescribed under § 60.8(f).
              (2) Except as provided under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, if affected facilities routinely share the same raw ink storage/handling system with existing facilities, then temporary measurement procedures for segregating the raw inks, related coatings, VOC solvent, and water used at the affected facilities must be employed during the test. For this case, an overall emission percentage for the combined facilities as well as for only the affected facilities must be calculated during the test.
              (3) For the purpose of measuring bulk storage tank quantities of each color of raw ink and each related coating used, the owner or operator of any affected facility shall install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate during the test one or more:
              (i) Non-resettable totalizer metering device(s) for indicating the cumulative liquid volumes used at each affected facility; or
              (ii) Segregated storage tanks for each affected facility to allow determination of the liquid quantities used by measuring devices other than the press meters required under item (i) of this article; or
              (iii) Storage tanks to serve more than one facility with the liquid quantities used determined by measuring devices other than press meters, if facilities are combined as decribed under paragraph (d), (f), or (g) of this section.
              (4) The owner or operator may choose to install an automatic temperature compensator with any liquid metering device used to measure the raw inks, related coatings, water, or VOC solvent used, or VOC solvent recovered.
              (5) Records of the measured amounts used at the affected facility and the liquid temperature at which the amounts were measured are maintained for each shipment of all purchased material on at least a weekly basis for:
              (i) The raw inks and related coatings used;
              (ii) The VOC and water content of each raw ink and related coating used as determined according to § 60.435;
              (iii) The VOC solvent and water added to the inks used;
              (iv) The VOC solvent used as a cleaning agent; and
              (v) The VOC solvent recovered.
              (6) The density variations with temperature of the raw inks, related coatings, VOC solvents used, and VOC solvent recovered are determined by the methods stipulated in § 60.435(d).
              (7) The calculated emission percentage may be reported as rounded-off to the nearest whole number.
              (8) Printing press startups and shutdowns are not included in the exemption provisions under § 60.8(c). Frequent periods of press startups and shutdowns are normal operations and constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.
              (b) If an affected facility uses waterborne ink systems or a combination of waterborne and solvent-borne ink systems with a solvent recovery system, compliance is determined by the following procedures, except as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section:

              (c) If an affected facility controlled by a solvent recovery system uses only solvent-borne ink systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine compliance on a direct mass or a density-corrected liquid volume basis. Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, compliance is determined as follows:

              (1) On a direct mass basis, compliance is determined according to paragraph (b) of this section, except that the water term, Mv, does not apply.
              (2) On a density-corrected liquid volume basis, compliance is determined by the following procedures:

              (d) If two or more affected facilities are controlled by the same solvent recovery system, compliance is determined by the procedures specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, whichever applies, except that (Lt)a and (Lr)a, (Mt)a, (Mr)a, and (Mv)a, are the collective amounts of VOC solvent and water corresponding to all the affected facilities controlled by that solvent recovery system. The average VOC emission percentage for each of the affected facilities controlled by that same solvent recovery system is assumed to be equal.
              (e) Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, if an existing facility (or facilities) and an affected facility (or facilities) are controlled in common by the same solvent recovery system, the owner or operator shall determine compliance by conducting a separate emission test on the existing facility (or facilities) and then conducting a performance test on the combined facilities as follows:
              (1) Before the initial startup of the affected facility (or facilities) and at any other time as requested by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall conduct emission test(s) on the existing facility (or facilities) controlled by the subject solvent recovery system. The solvent recovery system must handle VOC emissions from only the subject existing facility (or facilities), not from affected facilities, during the emission test.

On a direct mass basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined by the equation presented in article (i) of this paragraph. On a density-corrected liquid volume basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined by the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.026
              
              
                where the VOC solvent amounts pertain to only existing facilities.
              
              
              (6) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the results of the emission test.
              (7) After completion of the separate emission test on the existing facility (or facilities), the owner or operator shall conduct performance test(s) on the combined facilities with the solvent recovery system handling VOC emissions from both the existing and affected facilities.

              (8) During performance test(s), the emission percentage for the existing facility (or facilities), Pe, is assumed to be equal to that determined in the latest emission test. The administrator may request additional emission tests if any physical or operational changes occur to any of the subject existing facilities.
              (9) The emission percentage for the affected facility (or facilities) during performance test(s) with both existing and affected facilities connected to the solvent recovery system is determined by one of the following procedures:
              (i) If any of the combined facilities uses both waterborne and solvent-borne ink systems, the average VOC emission percentage must be determined on a direct mass basis according to paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, whichever applies, with the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.027
              
              
                where (Mt)b and (Mr)b are the collective VOC solvent amounts pertaining to all the combined facilities.
              
              
              (ii) If all of the combined facilities use only solvent-borne ink systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance of the affected facility (or facilities) either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected liquid volume basis according to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, whichever applies.

On a density-corrected liquid volume basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined by the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.028
              
              
                where (Lt)b and (Lr)b are the collective VOC solvent amounts pertaining to all the combined facilities.
              
              
              (f) The owner or operator may choose to show compliance of the combined performance of existing and affected facilities controlled in common by the same solvent recovery system. A separate emission test for existing facilities is not required for this option. The combined performance is determined by one of the following procedures:
              (1) If any of the combined facilities uses both waterborne and solvent-borne ink systems, the combined average VOC emission percentage must be determined on a direct mass basis according to paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, whichever applies, with the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.308
              

              (2) If all of the combined facilities use only solvent-borne ink systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected liquid volume basis according to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, whichever applies. On a direct mass basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined by the equation presented in article (i) of this paragraph. On a density-corrected liquid volume basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined by the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.029
              
              (g) If all existing and affected facilities located within the same plant boundary use waterborne ink systems or solvent-borne ink systems with solvent recovery systems, the owner or operator may choose to show compliance on a plantwide basis for all the existing and affected facilities together. No separate emission tests on existing facilities and no temporary segregated liquid measurement procedures for affected facilities are required for this option. The plantwide performance is determined by one of the following procedures:
              (1) If any of the facilities use waterborne ink systems, the total plant average VOC emission percentage must be determined on a direct mass basis according to paragraph (b) of this section with the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.030
              
              
                Where (Mt)f and (Mv)f are the collective VOC solvent and water amounts used at all the subject plant facilities during the performance test.
              
              
              (2) If all of the plant facilities use only solvent-borne ink systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected liquid volume basis according to paragraph (c) of this section. On a direct mass basis, the total plant average VOC emission percentage is determined by the equation presented in article (i) of this paragraph. On a density-corrected liquid volume basis, the total plant average VOC emission percentage is determined by the following equation:
              
                EC01JN92.031
              
              
                Where (Lt)f is the collective VOC solvent amount used at all the subject plant facilities during the performance test.

Separate emission percentages for only the affected facilities are not required in this case. The combined emission percentage is compared to the overall average for the existing and affected facilities' emission percentage determined during the most recent performance test.
              (3) Except as provided in article (4) of this paragraph, temperatures and liquid densities determined during the most recent performance test are used to calculate corrected volumes and mass quantities.
              (4) The owner or operator may choose to measure temperatures for determination of actual liquid densities during each performance averaging period. A different base temperature may be used for each performance averaging period if desired by the owner or operator.
              (5) The emission percentage is calculated according to the procedures under § 60.433 (b) through (g), whichever applies, or by a comparable calculation which compares the total solvent recovered to the total solvent used at the affected facility.

              § 60.442
              Standard for volatile organic compounds.

              (a) On and after the date on which the performance test required by § 60.8 has been completed each owner or operator subject to this subpart shall:
              
              (1) Cause the discharge into the atmosphere from an affected facility not more than 0.20 kg VOC/kg of coating solids applied as calculated on a weighted average basis for one calendar month; or
              (2) Demonstrate for each affected facility;

              § 60.443
              Compliance provisions.
              (a) To determine compliance with § 60.442 the owner or operator of the affected facility shall calculate a weighted average of the mass of solvent used per mass of coating solids applied for a one calendar month period according to the following procedures:
              (1) Determine the weight fraction of organics and the weight fraction of solids of each coating applied by using Reference Method 24 or by the coating manufacturer's formulation data.
              (2) Compute the weighted average by the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.032
              
              (3) For each affected facility where the value of G is less than or equal to 0.20 kg VOC per kg of coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance with § 60.442(a)(1).
              (b) To determine compliance with § 60.442(a)(2), the owner or operator shall calculate the required overall VOC emission reduction according to the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.033
              
              If Rq is less than or equal to 90 percent, then the required overall VOC emission reduction is Rq. If Rq is greater than 90 percent, then the required overall VOC emission reduction is 90 percent.
              (c) Where compliance with the emission limits specified in § 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent recovery system, the owner or operator shall determine the overall VOC emission reduction for a one calendar month period by the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.034
              
              If the R value is equal to or greater than the Rq value specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then compliance with § 60.442(a)(2) is demonstrated.
              (d) Where compliance with the emission limit specified in § 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent destruction device, the owner or operator shall determine calendar monthly compliance by comparing the monthly required overall VOC emission reduction specified in paragraph (b) of this section to the overall VOC emission reduction demonstrated in the most recent performance test which complied with § 60.442(a)(2). If the monthly required overall VOC emission reduction is less than or equal to the overall VOC reduction of the most recent performance test, the affected facility is in compliance with § 60.442(a)(2).

              (e) Where compliance with § 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent destruction device, the owner or operator shall continuously record the destruction device combustion temperature during coating operations for thermal incineration destruction devices or the gas temperature upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed during coating operations for catalytic incineration destruction devices. For thermal incineration destruction devices the owner or operator shall record all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average temperature of the device is more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average temperature of the device during the most recent performance test complying with § 60.442(a)(2). For catalytic incineration destruction devices, the owner or operator shall record all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average temperature of the device immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average temperature of the device during the most recent performance test complying with § 60.442(a)(2), and all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the device during the most recent performance test complying with § 60.442(a)(2).
              (f) After the initial performance test required for all affected facilities under § 60.8, compliance with the VOC emission limitation and percentage reduction requirements under § 60.442 is based on the average emission reduction for one calendar month. A separate compliance test is completed at the end of each calendar month after the initial performance test, and a new calendar month's average VOC emission reduction is calculated to show compliance with the standard.
              (g) If a common emission control device is used to recover or destroy solvent from more than one affected facility, the performance of that control device is assumed to be equal for each of the affected facilities. Compliance with § 60.442(a)(2) is determined by the methods specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and is performed simultaneously on all affected facilities.
              (h) If a common emission control device is used to recover solvent from an existing facility (or facilities) as well as from an affected facility (or facilities), the overall VOC emission reduction for the affected facility (or facilities), for the purpose of compliance, shall be determined by the following procedures:
              (1) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) shall determine the mass of solvent recovered for a calendar month period from the existing facility (or facilities) prior to the connection of the affected facility (or facilities) to the emission control device.
              (2) The affected facility (or facilities) shall then be connected to the emission control device.
              (3) The owner or operator shall determine the total mass of solvent recovered from both the existing and affected facilities over a calendar month period. The mass of solvent determined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section from the existing facility shall be subtracted from the total mass of recovered solvent to obtain the mass of solvent recovered from the affected facility (or facilities). The overall VOC emission reduction of the affected facility (or facilities) can then be determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (i) If a common emission control device(s) is used to destruct solvent from an existing facility (or facilities) as well as from an affected facility (or facilities), the overall VOC emission reduction for the affected facility (or facilities), for the purpose of compliance, shall be determined by the following procedures:
              (1) The owner or operator shall operate the emission control device with both the existing and affected facilities connected.
              (2) The concentration of VOC (in parts per million by volume) after the common emission control device shall be determined as specified in § 60.444(c). This concentration is used in the calculation of compliance for both the existing and affected facilities.
              (3) The volumetric flow out of the common control device attributable to the affected facility (or facilities) shall be calculated by first determining the ratio of the volumetric flow entering the common control device attributable to the affected facility (facilities) to the total volumetric flow entering the common control device from both existing and affected facilities. The multiplication of this ratio by the total volumetric flow out of the common control device yields the flow attributable to the affected facility (facilities). Compliance is determined by the use of the equation specified in § 60.444(c).
              (j) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source category. Emissions from these operations are to be included when determining if the standard specified at § 60.442(a)(2) is being attained.

              (2) Determine for each affected facility prior to each test run the weighted average mass of VOC per mass of coating solids applied being used at the facility. The weighted average shall be determined as specified in § 60.443(a). In this application the quantities of Woi, Wsi, and Mci shall be determined for the time period of each test run and not a calendar month as specified in § 60.441.

              (ii) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall construct a temporary total enclosure around the coating line applicator and flashoff area during the performance test for the purpose of capturing fugitive VOC emissions. If a permanent total enclosure exists in the affected facility prior to the performance test and the Administrator is satisfied that the enclosure is totally capturing fugitive VOC emissions, then no additional total enclosure will be required for the performance test.

              (iii) For each affected facility where the value of R is greater than or equal to the value of Rq calculated in § 60.443(b), compliance with § 60.442(a)(2) is demonstrated.

In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24 test and manufacturers' formulation data, the Method 24 test will govern. The Administrator may require an owner or operator to perform Method 24 tests during such months as he deems appropriate. For Method 24, the coating sample must be a one liter sample taken into a one liter container at a point where the sample will be representative of the coating applied to the web substrate.
              (b) Method 25 shall be used to determine the VOC concentration, in parts per million by volume, of each effluent gas stream entering and exiting the solvent destruction device or its equivalent, and each effluent gas stream emitted directly to the atmosphere.

For Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs must be at least 1 hour. The minimum sampling volume must be 0.003 dscm except that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variables or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator.
              (c) If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that testing of representative stacks yields results comparable to those that would be obtained by testing all stacks, the Administrator will approve testing of representative stacks on a case-by-case basis.

              On or after the date on which the performance test required by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of this subpart shall discharge or cause the discharge of VOC emissions that exceed 0.90 kilogram of VOC's per liter of applied coating solids from any surface coating operation on a large appliance surface coating line.
            
            
              § 60.453
              Performance test and compliance provisions.
              (a) Sections 60.8 (d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test procedures required by this subpart.
              (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8(a) and thereafter a performance test each calendar month for each affected facility according to the procedures in this paragraph.

              (1) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for any affected facility that does not use a capture system and control device to comply with the emissions limit specified under § 60.452. The owner or operator shall determine the composition of the coatings by formulation data supplied by the coating manufacturer or by analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the coating manufacturer to determine the VOC content of coatings using Method 24. The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent used for thinning purposes from company records on a monthly basis. If a common coating distribution system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and existing facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of coatings used at each facility, by using the average dry weight of coating and the surface area coated by each affected and existing facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.
              (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied each calendar month will be determined as follows.
              (A) Calculate the mass of VOC's consumed (Mo + Md) during the calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.035
              
              (ΣLdjDdj will be 0 if no VOC-solvent is added to the coatings, as received)
              
              
                where:
                
                n is the number of different coatings used during the calendar month, and
                m is the number of different VOC-solvents added to coatings during the calendar month.
              
              

              (B) Calculate the total volume of coating solids used (Ls) in the calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.036
              
              
                where n is the number of different coatings used during the calendar month.
              
              
              (C) Select the appropriate transfer efficiency from table 1. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown are appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case basis. Transfer efficiencies for application methods not listed shall be determined by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient data for the Administrator to judge the accuracy of the transfer efficiency claims.

              (ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions to the atmosphere (N) during the calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:
              
                EC16NO91.039
              
              (iii) Where the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's discharged to the atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) is equal to or less than 0.90 kilogram per liter, the affected facility is in compliance.
              (iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a VOC content, as received, which when divided by the lowest transfer efficiency at which the coating is applied, results in a value equal to or less than 0.90 kilogram per liter, the affected facility is in compliance, provided no VOC's are added to the coating during distribution or application.
              (2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for any affected facility that uses a capture system and a control device that destroys VOC's (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit specified under § 60.452.
              (i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture system and control device.

              (iv) If the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is equal to or less than 0.90 kilogram per liter of applied coating solids, the affected facility is in compliance.

              (3) An owner or operator shall use the following procedure for any affected facility that uses a control device for VOC recovery (e.g., carbon adsorber) to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under § 60.452.

              (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8(a) and thereafter a performance test for each calendar month for each affected facility according to the procedures in this section.

              (c) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for determining monthly volume-weighted average emissions of VOC's in kg/l of coating solids applied.

              (1) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility that does not use a capture system and control device to comply with the emission limit specified under § 60.462(a)(1). The owner or operator shall determine the composition of the coatings by formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or by an analysisof each coating, as received, using Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coatings to determine the VOC content of coatings using Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative method. The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent added to coatings from company records on a monthly basis. If a common coating distribution system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and existing facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of coating used at each affected facility by using the average dry weight of coating and the surface area coated by each affected and existing facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.
              (i) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied during each calendar month for each affected facility, except as provided under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.

              (iii) Where the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's discharged to the atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) is equal to or less than 0.28 kg/l, the affected facility is in compliance.

              (iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a VOC content, as received, that is equal to or less than 0.28 kg/l of coating solids, the affected facility is in compliance provided no VOC's are added to the coatings during distribution or application.
              (2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility that continuously uses a capture system and a control device that destroys VOC's (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit specified under § 60.462(a) (2) or (3).

                m is the number of gas streams leaving the control device and entering the atmosphere.
              
              
              The owner or operator of the affected facility shall construct the VOC emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 60.466. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall construct a temporary enclosure around the coating applicator and flashoff area during the performance test for the purpose of evaluating the capture efficiency of the system. The enclosure must be maintained at a negative pressure to ensure that all VOC emissions are measurable. If a permanent enclosure exists in the affected facility prior to the performance test and the Administrator is satisfied that the enclosure is adequately containing VOC emissions, no additional enclosure is required for the performance test.

              (a) Where compliance with the numerical limit specified in § 60.462(a) (1), (2), or (4) is achieved through the use of low VOC-content coatings without emission control devices or through the use of higher VOC-content coatings in conjunction with emission control devices, each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall include in the initial compliance report required by § 60.8 the weighted average of the VOC content of coatings used during a period of one calendar month for each affected facility. Where compliance with § 60.462(a)(4) is achieved through the intermittent use of a control device, reports shall include separate values of the weighted average VOC content of coatings used with and without the control device in operation.
              (b) Where compliance with § 60.462(a)(2), (3), or (4) is achieved through the use of an emission control device that destroys VOC's, each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall include the following data in the initial compliance report required by § 60.8:
              (1) The overall VOC destruction rate used to attain compliance with § 60.462(a)(2), (3), or (4) and the calculated emission limit used to attain compliance with § 60.462(a)(4); and
              (2) The combustion temperature of the thermal incinerator or the gas temperature, both upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed, used to attain compliance with § 60.462(a)(2), (3), or (4).
              (c) Following the initial performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall identify, record, and submit a written report to the Administrator every calendar quarter of each instance in which the volume-weighted average of the local mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere per volume of applied coating solids (N) is greater than the limit specified under § 60.462. If no such instances have occurred during a particular quarter, a report stating this shall be submitted to the Administrator semiannually.
              (d) The owner or operator of each affected facility shall also submit reports at the frequency specified in § 60.7(c) when the incinerator temperature drops as defined under § 60.464(c). If no such periods occur, the owner or operator shall state this in the report.

              (e) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain at the source, for a period of at least 2 years, records of all data and calculations used to determine monthly VOC emissions from each affected facility and to determine the monthly emission limit, where applicable. Where compliance is achieved through the use of thermal incineration, each owner or operator shall maintain, at the source, daily records of the incinerator combustion temperature. If catalytic incineration is used, the owner or operator shall maintain at the source daily records of the gas temperature, both upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed.

              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) The reference methods in appendix A to this part, except as provided under § 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with § 60.462 as follows:
              (1) Method 24, or data provided by the formulator of the coating, shall be used for determining the VOC content of each coating as applied to the surface of the metal coil. In the event of a dispute, Method 24 shall be the reference method. When VOC content of waterborne coatings, determined by Method 24, is used to determine compliance of affected facilities, the results of the Method 24 analysis shall be adjusted as described in Section 12.6 of Method 24;
              (2) Method 25, both for measuring the VOC concentration in each gas stream entering and leaving the control device on each stack equipped with an emission control device and for measuring the VOC concentration in each gas stream emitted directly to the atmosphere;
              (3) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses;
              (4) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rate;
              (5) Method 3 for gas analysis; and
              (6) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.
              (b) For Method 24, the coating sample must be at least a 1-liter sample taken at a point where the sample will be representative of the coating as applied to the surface of the metal coil.
              (c) For Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs is to be at least 60 minutes, and the minimum sampling volume is to be at least 0.003 dscm (0.11 dscf); however, shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variables or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator.
              (d) The Administrator will approve testing of representative stacks on a case-by-case basis if the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that testing of representative stacks yields results comparable to those that would be obtained by testing all stacks.

              Monitoring of operations.
              (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart, and using either an electrostatic precipitator or a high velocity air filter to meet the emission limit in § 60.472(a)(1) and/or (b)(1) shall continuously monitor and record the temperature of the gas at the inlet of the control device. The temperature monitoring instrument shall have an accuracy of ±15 °C (±25 °F) over its range.
              (b) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart and using an afterburner to meet the emission limit in § 60.472(a)(1) and/or (b)(1) shall continuously monitor and record the temperature in the combustion zone of the afterburner. The monitoring instrument shall have an accuracy of ±10 °C (±18 °F) over its range.
              (c) An owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart and using a control device not mentioned in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall provide to the Administrator information describing the operation of the control device and the process parameter(s) which would indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device.

              § 60.474
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) For saturators, the owner or operator shall conduct performance tests required in § 60.8 as follows:
              (1) If the final product is shingle or mineral-surfaced roll roofing, the tests shall be conducted while 106.6-kg (235-lb) shingle is being produced.
              (2) If the final product is saturated felt or smooth-surfaced roll roofing, the tests shall be conducted while 6.8-kg (15-lb) felt is being produced.
              (3) If the final product is fiberglass shingle, the test shall be conducted while a nominal 100-kg (220-lb) shingle is being produced.

              (b) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).
              
              (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.472 as follows:

              (1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter shall be computed for each run using the following equation:
              
              E = (cs Qsd)/(PK)
              
              
                where:
                
                E = emission rate of particulate matter, kg/Mg (lb/ton).
                cs = concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
                Qsd = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
                P = asphalt roofing production rate or asphalt charging rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr).
                K = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg [7000 (gr/lb)].
              
              

              (2) Method 5A shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration (cs) and volumetric flow rate (Qsd) of the effluent gas. For a saturator, the sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 120 minutes and 3.00 dscm (106 dscf), and for the blowing still, at least 90 minutes or the duration of the coating blow or non-coating blow, whichever is greater, and 2.25 dscm (79.4 dscf).
              (3) For the saturator, the asphalt roofing production rate (P) for each run shall be determined as follows: The amount of asphalt roofing produced on the shingle or saturated felt process lines shall be obtained by direct measurement. The asphalt roofing production rate is the amount produced divided by the time taken for the run.

              (4) For the blowing still, the asphalt charging rate (P) shall be computed for each run using the following equation:
              
              P = (Vd)/(K′ θ)
              
              
                where:
                
                P = asphalt charging rate to blowing still, Mg/hr (ton/hr).
                V = volume of asphalt charged, m3 (ft3).
                d = density of asphalt, kg/m3 (lb/ft3).
                K′ = conversion factor, 1000 kg/Mg (2000 lb/ton).
                θ = duration of test run, hr.
              
              
              (i) The volume (V) of asphalt charged shall be measured by any means accurate to within 10 percent.
              (ii) The density (d) of the asphalt shall be computed using the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.015
              
              
                Where:
                
                d = Density of the asphalt, kg/m3 (lb/ft3)
                K1 = 1056.1 kg/m3 (metric units)
                 = 64.70 lb/ft3 (English Units)
                K2 = 0.6176 kg/(m3 °C) (metric units)
                 = 0.0694 lb/(ft3 °F) (English Units)
                Ti = temperature at the start of the blow, °C ( deg;F)
              
              
              (5) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
              (d) The Administrator will determine compliance with the standards in § 60.472(a)(3) by using Method 22, modified so that readings are recorded every 15 seconds for a period of consecutive observations during representative conditions (in accordance with § 60.8(c)) totaling 60 minutes. A performance test shall consist of one run.
              (e) The owner or operator shall use the monitoring device in § 60.473 (a) or (b) to monitor and record continuously the temperature during the particulate matter run and shall report the results to the Administrator with the performance test results.
              (f) If at a later date the owner or operator believes that the emission limits in § 60.472(a) and (b) are being met even though one of the conditions listed in this paragraph exist, he may submit a written request to the Administrator to repeat the performance test and procedure outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (1) The temperature measured in accordance with § 60.473(a) is exceeding that measured during the performance test.
              (2) The temperature measured in accordance with § 60.473(b) is lower than that measured during the performance test.

              (g) If fuel oil is to be used to fire an afterburner used to control emissions from a blowing still, the owner or operator may petition the Administrator in accordance with § 60.11(e) of the General Provisions to establish an opacity standard for the blowing still that will be the opacity standard when fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. To obtain this opacity standard, the owner or operator must request the Administrator to determine opacity during an initial, or subsequent, performance test when fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. Upon receipt of the results of the performance test, the Administrator will make a finding concerning compliance with the mass standard for the blowing still. If the Administrator finds that the facility was in compliance with the mass standard during the performance test but failed to meet the zero opacity standard, the Administrator will establish and promulgate in the Federal Register an opacity standard for the blowing still that will be the opacity standard when fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. When the afterburner is fired with natural gas, the zero percent opacity remains the applicable opacity standard.

              (g) If the storage vessel is shared with multiple process units, the process unit with the greatest annual amount of stored materials (predominant use) is the process unit the storage vessel is assigned to. If the storage vessel is shared equally among process units, and one of the process units has equipment subject to subpart VVa of this part, the storage vessel is assigned to that process unit. If the storage vessel is shared equally among process units, none of which have equipment subject to subpart VVa of this part, the storage vessel is assigned to any process unit subject to this subpart. If the predominant use of the storage vessel varies from year to year, then the owner or operator must estimate the predominant use initially and reassess every 3 years. The owner or operator must keep records of the information and supporting calculations that show how predominant use is determined. All equipment on the storage vessel must be monitored when in VOC service.

              (3) Is tested for compliance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section initially upon designation, annually, and at other times requested by the Administrator.
              (g) Any valve that is designated, as described in § 60.486a(f)(1), as an unsafe-to-monitor valve is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if:
              (1) The owner or operator of the valve demonstrates that the valve is unsafe to monitor because monitoring personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with paragraph (a) of this section, and
              (2) The owner or operator of the valve adheres to a written plan that requires monitoring of the valve as frequently as practicable during safe-to-monitor times.
              (h) Any valve that is designated, as described in § 60.486a(f)(2), as a difficult-to-monitor valve is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if:

              (1) The owner or operator demonstrates that emissions of purged material resulting from immediate repair are greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of repair, and
              (2) When repair procedures are effected, the purged material is collected and destroyed or recovered in a control device complying with § 60.482-10a.
              (d) Delay of repair for pumps will be allowed if:
              (1) Repair requires the use of a dual mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system, and
              (2) Repair is completed as soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the leak was detected.
              (e) Delay of repair beyond a process unit shutdown will be allowed for a valve, if valve assembly replacement is necessary during the process unit shutdown, valve assembly supplies have been depleted, and valve assembly supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted. Delay of repair beyond the next process unit shutdown will not be allowed unless the next process unit shutdown occurs sooner than 6 months after the first process unit shutdown.
              (f) When delay of repair is allowed for a leaking pump, valve, or connector that remains in service, the pump, valve, or connector may be considered to be repaired and no longer subject to delay of repair requirements if two consecutive monthly monitoring instrument readings are below the leak definition.

              Standards: Connectors in gas/vapor service and in light liquid service.
              (a) The owner or operator shall initially monitor all connectors in the process unit for leaks by the later of either 12 months after the compliance date or 12 months after initial startup. If all connectors in the process unit have been monitored for leaks prior to the compliance date, no initial monitoring is required provided either no process changes have been made since the monitoring or the owner or operator can determine that the results of the monitoring, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. If required to monitor because of a process change, the owner or operator is required to monitor only those connectors involved in the process change.
              (b) Except as allowed in § 60.482-1a(c), § 60.482-10a, or as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors in gas and vapor and light liquid service as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) of this section.
              (1) The connectors shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method specified in § 60.485a(b) and, as applicable, § 60.485a(c).
              (2) If an instrument reading greater than or equal to 500 ppm is measured, a leak is detected.
              (3) The owner or operator shall perform monitoring, subsequent to the initial monitoring required in paragraph (a) of this section, as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, and shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iv) and (v) of this section. The required period in which monitoring must be conducted shall be determined from paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section using the monitoring results from the preceding monitoring period. The percent leaking connectors shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (i) If the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was greater than or equal to 0.5 percent, then monitor within 12 months (1 year).
              (ii) If the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was greater than or equal to 0.25 percent but less than 0.5 percent, then monitor within 4 years. An owner or operator may comply with the requirements of this paragraph by monitoring at least 40 percent of the connectors within 2 years of the start of the monitoring period, provided all connectors have been monitored by the end of the 4-year monitoring period.
              (iii) If the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was less than 0.25 percent, then monitor as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section and either paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) or (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, as appropriate.
              (A) An owner or operator shall monitor at least 50 percent of the connectors within 4 years of the start of the monitoring period.
              (B) If the percent of leaking connectors calculated from the monitoring results in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is greater than or equal to 0.35 percent of the monitored connectors, the owner or operator shall monitor as soon as practical, but within the next 6 months, all connectors that have not yet been monitored during the monitoring period. At the conclusion of monitoring, a new monitoring period shall be started pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, based on the percent of leaking connectors within the total monitored connectors.
              (C) If the percent of leaking connectors calculated from the monitoring results in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is less than 0.35 percent of the monitored connectors, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors that have not yet been monitored within 8 years of the start of the monitoring period.
              (iv) If, during the monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, a connector is found to be leaking, it shall be re-monitored once within 90 days after repair to confirm that it is not leaking.

              (v) The owner or operator shall keep a record of the start date and end date of each monitoring period under this section for each process unit.

              (c) For use in determining the monitoring frequency, as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) of this section, the percent leaking connectors as used in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) of this section shall be calculated by using the following equation:
              
              %CL = CL / Ct * 100
              
              
                Where:
                
                %CL = Percent of leaking connectors as determined through periodic monitoring required in paragraphs (a) and (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                CL = Number of connectors measured at 500 ppm or greater, by the method specified in § 60.485a(b).
                Ct = Total number of monitored connectors in the process unit or affected facility.
              
              
              (d) When a leak is detected pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in § 60.482-9a. A first attempt at repair as defined in this subpart shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after the leak is detected.
              (e) Any connector that is designated, as described in § 60.486a(f)(1), as an unsafe-to-monitor connector is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if:
              (1) The owner or operator of the connector demonstrates that the connector is unsafe-to-monitor because monitoring personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; and
              (2) The owner or operator of the connector has a written plan that requires monitoring of the connector as frequently as practicable during safe-to-monitor times but not more frequently than the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise applicable, and repair of the equipment according to the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section if a leak is detected.
              (f) Inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connectors. (1) Any connector that is inaccessible or that is ceramic or ceramic-lined (e.g., porcelain, glass, or glass-lined), is exempt from the monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, from the leak repair requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, and from the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of §§ 63.1038 and 63.1039. An inaccessible connector is one that meets any of the provisions specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, as applicable:
              (i) Buried;
              (ii) Insulated in a manner that prevents access to the connector by a monitor probe;
              (iii) Obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the connector by a monitor probe;
              (iv) Unable to be reached from a wheeled scissor-lift or hydraulic-type scaffold that would allow access to connectors up to 7.6 meters (25 feet) above the ground;
              (v) Inaccessible because it would require elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters (7 feet) above a permanent support surface or would require the erection of scaffold; or
              (vi) Not able to be accessed at any time in a safe manner to perform monitoring. Unsafe access includes, but is not limited to, the use of a wheeled scissor-lift on unstable or uneven terrain, the use of a motorized man-lift basket in areas where an ignition potential exists, or access would require near proximity to hazards such as electrical lines, or would risk damage to equipment.
              (2) If any inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connector is observed by visual, audible, olfactory, or other means to be leaking, the visual, audible, olfactory, or other indications of a leak to the atmosphere shall be eliminated as soon as practical.
              (g) Except for instrumentation systems and inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connectors meeting the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, identify the connectors subject to the requirements of this subpart. Connectors need not be individually identified if all connectors in a designated area or length of pipe subject to the provisions of this subpart are identified as a group, and the number of connectors subject is indicated.

              Equivalence of means of emission limitation.
              (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart may apply to the Administrator for determination of equivalence for any means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of VOC at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of VOC achieved by the controls required in this subpart.
              (b) Determination of equivalence to the equipment, design, and operational requirements of this subpart will be evaluated by the following guidelines:

              (1) Each owner or operator applying for an equivalence determination shall be responsible for collecting and verifying test data to demonstrate equivalence of means of emission limitation.
              (2) The Administrator will compare test data for demonstrating equivalence of the means of emission limitation to test data for the equipment, design, and operational requirements.
              (3) The Administrator may condition the approval of equivalence on requirements that may be necessary to assure operation and maintenance to achieve the same emission reduction as the equipment, design, and operational requirements.

              § 60.485a
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).
              (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standards in §§ 60.482-1a through 60.482-11a, 60.483a, and 60.484a as follows:
              (1) Method 21 shall be used to determine the presence of leaking sources. The instrument shall be calibrated before use each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 of this part. The following calibration gases shall be used:
              (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); and

              (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration no more than 2,000 ppm greater than the leak definition concentration of the equipment monitored. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple calibration scales, then the lower scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is no higher than 2,000 ppm above the concentration specified as a leak, and the highest scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is approximately equal to 10,000 ppm. If only one scale on an instrument will be used during monitoring, the owner or operator need not calibrate the scales that will not be used during that day's monitoring.
              (2) A calibration drift assessment shall be performed, at a minimum, at the end of each monitoring day. Check the instrument using the same calibration gas(es) that were used to calibrate the instrument before use. Follow the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 of this part, Section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to the calibration gas value. Record the instrument reading for each scale used as specified in § 60.486a(e)(7). Calculate the average algebraic difference between the three meter readings and the most recent calibration value. Divide this algebraic difference by the initial calibration value and multiply by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage. If any calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then all equipment monitored since the last calibration with instrument readings below the appropriate leak definition and above the leak definition multiplied by (100 minus the percent of negative drift/divided by 100) must be re-monitored. If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at the owner/operator's discretion, all equipment since the last calibration with instrument readings above the appropriate leak definition and below the leak definition multiplied by (100 plus the percent of positive drift/divided by 100) may be re-monitored.
              (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the no-detectable-emission standards in §§ 60.482-2a(e), 60.482-3a(i), 60.482-4a, 60.482-7a(f), and 60.482-10a(e) as follows:
              (1) The requirements of paragraph (b) shall apply.
              (2) Method 21 of appendix A-7 of this part shall be used to determine the background level. All potential leak interfaces shall be traversed as close to the interface as possible. The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 500 ppm for determining compliance.
              (d) The owner or operator shall test each piece of equipment unless he demonstrates that a process unit is not in VOC service, i.e., that the VOC content would never be reasonably expected to exceed 10 percent by weight. For purposes of this demonstration, the following methods and procedures shall be used:
              (1) Procedures that conform to the general methods in ASTM E260-73, 91, or 96, E168-67, 77, or 92, E169-63, 77, or 93 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the percent VOC content in the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a piece of equipment.
              (2) Organic compounds that are considered by the Administrator to have negligible photochemical reactivity may be excluded from the total quantity of organic compounds in determining the VOC content of the process fluid.
              (3) Engineering judgment may be used to estimate the VOC content, if a piece of equipment had not been shown previously to be in service. If the Administrator disagrees with the judgment, paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
              (e) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that a piece of equipment is in light liquid service by showing that all the following conditions apply:

              (1) The vapor pressure of one or more of the organic components is greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 °C (1.2 in. H2O at 68 °F). Standard reference texts or ASTM D2879-83, 96, or 97 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the vapor pressures.

              (2) The total concentration of the pure organic components having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 °C (1.2 in. H2O at 68 °F) is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight.
              (3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.
              (f) Samples used in conjunction with paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of this section shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment or the gas being combusted in the flare.
              (g) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standards of flares as follows:
              (1) Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part shall be used to determine visible emissions.
              (2) A thermocouple or any other equivalent device shall be used to monitor the presence of a pilot flame in the flare.

              (3) The maximum permitted velocity for air assisted flares shall be computed using the following equation:
              
              Vmax = K1 + K2HT
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                Vmax = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec (ft/sec).
                HT = Net heating value of the gas being combusted, MJ/scm (Btu/scf).
                K1 = 8.706 m/sec (metric units) = 28.56 ft/sec (English units).
                K2 = 0.7084 m4/(MJ-sec) (metric units) = 0.087 ft4/(Btu-sec) (English units).
              
              

              (4) The net heating value (HT) of the gas being combusted in a flare shall be computed using the following equation:
              
              
                ER16NO07.038
              
              
                Where:
                
                K = Conversion constant, 1.740 × 10−7 (g-mole)(MJ)/(ppm-scm-kcal) (metric units) = 4.674 × 10−6 [(g-mole)(Btu)/(ppm-scf-kcal)] (English units).
                Ci = Concentration of sample component “i,” ppm
                Hi = net heat of combustion of sample component “i” at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg (77 °F and 14.7 psi), kcal/g-mole.
              
              
              (5) Method 18 of appendix A-6 of this part or ASTM D6420-99 (2004) (where the target compound(s) are those listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99, and the target concentration is between 150 parts per billion by volume and 100 ppmv) and ASTM D2504-67, 77, or 88 (Reapproved 1993) (incorporated by reference-see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the concentration of sample component “i.”
              (6) ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by reference-see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the net heat of combustion of component “i” if published values are not available or cannot be calculated.
              (7) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A-7 of this part, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the actual exit velocity of a flare. If needed, the unobstructed (free) cross-sectional area of the flare tip shall be used.
              (h) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with § 60.483-1a or § 60.483-2a as follows:

              (1) The percent of valves leaking shall be determined using the following equation:
              
              %VL = (VL / VT) * 100
              
              
                Where:
                
                %VL = Percent leaking valves.
                VL = Number of valves found leaking.
                VT = The sum of the total number of valves monitored.
              
              
              (2) The total number of valves monitored shall include difficult-to-monitor and unsafe-to-monitor valves only during the monitoring period in which those valves are monitored.
              (3) The number of valves leaking shall include valves for which repair has been delayed.
              (4) Any new valve that is not monitored within 30 days of being placed in service shall be included in the number of valves leaking and the total number of valves monitored for the monitoring period in which the valve is placed in service.
              (5) If the process unit has been subdivided in accordance with § 60.482-7a(c)(1)(ii), the sum of valves found leaking during a monitoring period includes all subgroups.
              (6) The total number of valves monitored does not include a valve monitored to verify repair.

              Applicability and designation of affected facility.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to the following affected facilities in beverage can surface coating lines: each exterior base coat operation, each overvarnish coating operation, and each inside spray coating operation.
              (b) The provisions of this subpart apply to each affected facility which is identified in paragraph (a) of this section and commences construction, modification, or reconstruction after November 26, 1980.
            
            
              § 60.491
              Definitions.
              (a) All terms which are used in this subpart and are not defined below are given the same meaning as in the Act and subpart A of this part.
              (1) Beverage can means any two-piece steel or aluminum container in which soft drinks or beer, including malt liquor, are packaged. The definition does not include containers in which fruit or vegetable juices are packaged.
              (2) Exterior base coating operation means the system on each beverage can surface coating line used to apply a coating to the exterior of a two-piece beverage can body. The exterior base coat provides corrosion resistance and a background for lithography or printing operations. The exterior base coat operation consists of the coating application station, flashoff area, and curing oven. The exterior base coat may be pigmented or clear (unpigmented).
              (3) Inside spray coating operation means the system on each beverage can surface coating line used to apply a coating to the interior of a two-piece beverage can body. This coating provides a protective film between the contents of the beverage can and the metal can body. The inside spray coating operation consists of the coating application station, flashoff area, and curing oven. Multiple applications of an inside spray coating are considered to be a single coating operation.
              (4) Overvarnish coating operation means the system on each beverage can surface coating line used to apply a coating over ink which reduces friction for automated beverage can filling equipment, provides gloss, and protects the finished beverage can body from abrasion and corrosion. The overvarnish coating is applied to two-piece beverage can bodies. The overvarnish coating operation consists of the coating application station, flashoff area, and curing oven.
              
              (5) Two-piece can means any beverage can that consists of a body manufactured from a single piece of steel or aluminum and a top. Coatings for a two-piece can are usually applied after fabrication of the can body.
              (6) VOC content means all volatile organic compounds (VOC) that are in a coating. VOC content is expressed in terms of kilograms of VOC per liter of coating solids.

              Performance test and compliance provisions.
              (a) Section 60.8(d) does not apply to monthly performance tests and § 60.8(f) does not apply to the performance test procedures required by this subpart.
              (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8(a) and thereafter a performance test each calendar month for each affected facility.

              (1) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility that does not use a capture system and a control device to comply with the emission limit specified under § 60.492. The owner or operator shall determine the VOC-content of the coatings from formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or by an analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating to determine the VOC content of coatings using Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative method. The owner or operator shall determine from company records the volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent added to coatings. If a common coating distribution system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and exiting facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of coating used at each facility by using the average dry weight of coating, number of cans, and size of cans being processed by each affected and existing facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.
              (i) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC per volume of coating solids used during the calendar month for each affected facility, except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. The volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC per volume of coating solids used each calendar month will be determined by the following procedures.
              (A) Calculate the mass of VOC used (Mo + Md) during the calendar month for the affected facility by the following equation:

                EC16NO91.061
              
              (iii) Where the value of the volume-weighted average mass of VOC per volume of solids discharged to the atmosphere (N) is equal to or less than the applicable emission limit specified under § 60.492, the affected facility is in compliance.
              (iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a VOC content equal to or less than the limit specified under § 60.492, the affected facility is in compliance provided no VOC-solvents are added to the coating during distribution or application.
              (2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility that uses a capture system and a control device that destroys VOC (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit specified under § 60.492.
              (i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture system and control device.

              For the initial performance test, the overall reduction efficiency (R) shall be determined as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of this section. In subsequent months, the owner or operator may use the most recently determined overall reduction efficiency for the performance test providing control device and capture system operating conditions have not changed. The procedure in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (A), (B), and (C) of this section, shall be repeated when directed by the Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the control device or capture system at conditions different from the initial performance test.

              § 60.495
              Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
              (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall include the following data in the initial compliance report required under § 60.8(a).
              (1) Where only coatings which individually have a VOC content equal to or less than the limits specified under § 60.492 are used, and no VOC is added to the coating during the application or distribution process, the owner or operator shall provide a list of the coatings used for each affected facility and the VOC content of each coating calculated from data determined using Method 24 or supplied by the manufacturers of the coatings.
              (2) Where one or more coatings which individually have a VOC content greater than the limits specified under § 60.492 are used or where VOC are added or used in the coating process, the owner or operator shall report for each affected facility the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC per volume of coating solids.
              (3) Where compliance is achieved through the use of incineration, the owner or operator shall include in the initial performance test required under § 60.8(a) the combustion temperature (or the gas temperature upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed), the total mass of VOC per volume of coating solids before and after the incinerator, capture efficiency, and the destruction efficiency of the incinerator used to attain compliance with the applicable emission limit specified under § 60.492. The owner or operator shall also include a description of the method used to establish the amount of VOC captured by the capture system and sent to the control device.
              (b) Following the initial performance test, each owner or operator shall identify, record, and submit quarterly reports to the Administrator of each instance in which the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC per volume of coating solids, after the control device, if capture devices and control systems are used, is greater than the limit specified under § 60.492. If no such instances occur during a particular quarter, a report stating this shall be submitted to the Administrator semiannually.
              (c) Following the initial performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall identify, record, and submit at the frequency specified in § 60.7(c) the following:
              (1) Where compliance with § 60.492 is achieved through the use of thermal incineration, each 3-hour period when cans are processed, during which the average temperature of the device was more than 28 °C below the average temperature of the device during the most recent performance test at which destruction efficiency was determined as specified under § 60.493.

              (2) Where compliance with § 60.492 is achieved through the use of catalytic incineration, each 3-hour period when cans are being processed, during which the average temperature of the device immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 °C below the average temperature of the device immediately before the catalyst bed during the most recent performance test at which destruction efficiency was determined as specified under § 60.493 and all 3-hour periods, when cans are being processed, during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed during the most recent performance test at which destruction efficiency was determined as specified under § 60.494.
              (3) For thermal and catalytic incinerators, if no such periods as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section occur, the owner or operator shall state this in the report.
              (d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain at the source, for a period of at least 2 years, records of all data and calculations used to determine VOC emissions from each affected facility in the initial and monthly performance tests. Where compliance is achieved through the use of thermal incineration, each owner or operator shall maintain, at the source, daily records of the incinerator combustion chamber temperature. If catalytic incineration is used, the owner or operator shall maintain at the source daily records of the gas temperature, both upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed. Where compliance is achieved through the use of a solvent recovery system, the owner or operator shall maintain at the source daily records of the amount of solvent recovered by the system for each affected facility.
              (e) The requirements of this section remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected facilities within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this subsection, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.

              § 60.496
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) The reference methods in appendix A to this part, except as provided in § 60.8, shall be used to conduct performance tests.
              (1) Method 24, an equivalent or alternative method approved by the Administrator, or manufacturers' formulation data from which the VOC content of the coatings used for each affected facility can be calculated. In the event of a dispute, Method 24 data shall govern. When VOC content of water-borne coatings, determined from data generated by Method 24, is used to determine compliance of affected facilities, the results of the Method 24 analysis shall be adjusted as described in Section 12.6 of Method 24.
              (2) Method 25 or an equivalent or alternative method for the determination of the VOC concentration in the effluent gas entering and leaving the control device for each stack equipped with an emission control device. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days in advance of any State test using Method 25. The following reference methods are to be used in conjunction with Method 25:
              (i) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses,
              (ii) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rate,
              (iii) Method 3 for gas analysis, and
              (iv) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.
              (b) For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-litre sample collected in a 1-litre container at a point where the sample will be representative of the coating material.
              (c) For Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs must be at least 1 hour. The minimum sample volume must be 0.003 dscm except that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variables or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator. The Administrator will approve the sampling of representative stacks on a case-by-case basis if the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the testing of representative stacks would yield results comparable to those that would be obtained by testing all stacks.
