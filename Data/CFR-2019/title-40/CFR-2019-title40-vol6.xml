      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

These performance requirements and the specific test(s) for them will be determined by Administrator for each specific candidate method or type of candidate method and may be similar to or based on corresponding tests and requirements set forth in subpart F of this part or may be special requirements and tests tailored by the Administrator to the specific nature, design, and operational characteristics of the candidate method. For example, a candidate method with an inlet design deviating substantially from the design of the reference method inlet would likely be subject to an inlet aspiration test similar to that set forth in § 53.63. Similarly, a candidate method having an inertial fractionation system substantially different from that of the reference method would likely be subject to a static fractionation test and a loading test similar to those set forth in §§ 53.64 and 53.65, respectively. A candidate method <PRTPAGE P="11"/>with more extensive or profound deviations from the design and function of the reference method may be subject to other tests, full wind-tunnel tests similar to those described in § 53.62, or to special tests adapted or developed individually to accommodate the specific type of measurement or operation of the candidate method.</P>

              <P>(2) Determine that it is inappropriate to propose a revision of the appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question, determine whether the candidate method is a reference or equivalent method, and send notice of the determinations, including a statement of reasons for the determination not to propose a revision, to the applicant.</P>
              <P>(3) Send notice to the applicant that additional information must be submitted before a determination can be made and specify the additional information that is needed (in such cases, the 120-day period shall commence upon receipt of the additional information).</P>

              <P>(A) To revise the appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question.</P>
              <P>(B) Where the appendix specifies a measurement principle and calibration procedure, to cancel reference method designations based on the appendix.</P>
              <P>(C) To cancel equivalent method designations based on the existing reference method(s).</P>

              <P>(ii) The notice of proposed rulemaking will include the terms or substance of the proposed revision, will indicate what period(s) of time the Administrator proposes to allow for replacement of existing methods under <PRTPAGE P="20"/>section 2.3 of appendix C to part 58 of this chapter, and will solicit public comments on the proposal with particular reference to the considerations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The test procedures given in this subpart shall be used to test the performance of candidate automated methods against the performance requirement specifications given in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53. A test analyzer representative of the candidate automated method must exhibit performance better than, or not outside, the specified limit or limits for each such performance parameter specified (except range) to satisfy the requirements of this subpart. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the measurement range of the candidate method must be the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 to satisfy the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Measurement ranges.</E> For a candidate method having more than one selectable measurement range, one range must be the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53, and a test analyzer representative of the method must pass the tests required by this subpart while operated in that range.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Higher ranges.</E> The tests may be repeated for one or more higher (broader) ranges (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> ranges extending to higher <PRTPAGE P="22"/>concentrations) than the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53, provided that the range does not extend to concentrations more than four times the upper range limit of the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53. For such higher ranges, only the tests for range (calibration), noise at 80% of the upper range limit, and lag, rise and fall time are required to be repeated. For the purpose of testing a higher range, the test procedure of § 53.23(e) may be abridged to include only those components needed to test lag, rise and fall time.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lower ranges.</E> The tests may be repeated for one or more lower (narrower) ranges (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> ones extending to lower concentrations) than the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53. For methods for some pollutants, table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 specifies special performance limit requirements for lower ranges. If special low-range performance limit requirements are not specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53, then the performance limit requirements for the standard range apply. For lower ranges for any method, only the tests for range (calibration), noise at 0% of the measurement range, lower detectable limit, (and nitric oxide interference for SO<E T="52">2</E> UVF methods) are required to be repeated, provided the tests for the standard range shows the applicable limit specifications are met for the other test parameters.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the tests are conducted and passed only for the specified standard range, any FRM or FEM determination with respect to the method will be limited to that range. If the tests are passed for both the specified range and one or more higher or lower ranges, any such determination will include the additional higher or lower range(s) as well as the specified standard range. Appropriate test data shall be submitted for each range sought to be included in a FRM or FEM method determination under this paragraph (b).</P>
              <P>(c) For each performance parameter (except range), the test procedure shall be initially repeated seven (7) times to yield 7 test results. Each result shall be compared with the corresponding performance limit specification in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53; a value higher than or outside the specified limit or limits constitutes a failure. These 7 results for each parameter shall be interpreted as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Zero (0) failures: The candidate method passes the test for the performance parameter.</P>
              <P>(2) Three (3) or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for the performance parameter.</P>
              <P>(3) One (1) or two (2) failures: Repeat the test procedures for the performance parameter eight (8) additional times yielding a total of fifteen (15) test results. The combined total of 15 test results shall then be interpreted as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) One (1) or two (2) failures: The candidate method passes the test for the performance parameter.</P>
              <P>(ii) Three (3) or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for the performance parameter.</P>
              <P>(d) The tests for <E T="03">zero drift, span drift, lag time, rise time, fall time,</E> and <E T="03">precision</E> shall be carried out in a single integrated procedure conducted at various line voltages and ambient temperatures specified in § 53.23(e). A temperature-controlled environmental test chamber large enough to contain the test analyzer is recommended for this test. The tests for <E T="03">noise, lower detectable limit,</E> and <E T="03">interference equivalent</E> shall be conducted at any ambient temperature between 20 °C and 30 °C, at any normal line voltage between 105 and 125 volts, and shall be conducted such that not more than three (3) test results for each parameter are obtained in any 24-hour period.</P>
              <P>(e) If necessary, all measurement response readings to be recorded shall be converted to concentration units or adjusted according to the calibration curve constructed in accordance with § 53.21(b).</P>
              <P>(f) All recorder chart tracings (or equivalent data plots), records, test data and other documentation obtained from or pertinent to these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and submitted.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test conditions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Set-up and start-up</E> of the test analyzer shall be in strict accordance with the operating instructions specified in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). Allow adequate warm-up or stabilization time as indicated in the operating instructions before beginning the tests. The test procedures assume that the test analyzer has a conventional analog measurement signal output that is connected to a suitable strip chart recorder of the servo, null-balance type. This recorder shall have a chart width of at least 25 centimeters, chart speeds up to 10 cm per hour, a response time of 1 second or less, a deadband of not more than 0.25 percent of full scale, and capability either of reading measurements at least 5 percent below zero or of offsetting the zero by at least 5 percent. If the test analyzer does not have an analog signal output, or if a digital or other type of measurement data output is used for the tests, an alternative measurement data recording device (or devices) may be used for recording the test data, provided that the device is reasonably suited to the nature and purposes of the tests, and an analog representation of the analyzer measurements for each test can be plotted or otherwise generated that is reasonably similar to the analog measurement recordings that would be produced by a conventional chart recorder connected to a conventional analog signal output.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Calibration</E> of the test analyzer shall be carried out prior to conducting the tests described in this subpart. The calibration shall be as indicated in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3) and as follows: If the chart recorder or alternative data recorder does not have below zero capability, adjust either the controls of the test analyzer or the chart or data recorder to obtain a + 5% offset zero reading on the recorder chart to facilitate observing negative response or drift. If the candidate method is not capable of negative response, the test analyzer (not the data recorder) shall be operated with a similar offset zero. Construct and submit a calibration curve showing a plot of recorder scale readings or other measurement output readings (vertical or y-axis) against pollutant concentrations presented to the analyzer for measurement (horizontal or x-axis). If applicable, a plot of base analog output units (volts, millivolts, milliamps, <E T="03">etc.</E>) against pollutant concentrations shall also be obtained and submitted. All such calibration plots shall consist of at least seven (7) approximately equally spaced, identifiable points, including 0 and 90 ±5 percent of the upper range limit (URL).</P>
              <P>(c) Once the test analyzer has been set up and calibrated and the tests started, manual adjustment or normal periodic maintenance is permitted only every 3 days. Automatic adjustments which the test analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time. The submitted records shall show clearly when any manual adjustment or periodic maintenance was made during the tests and describe the specific operations performed.</P>
              <P>(d) If the test analyzer should malfunction during any of the performance tests, the tests for that parameter shall be repeated. A detailed explanation of the malfunction, remedial action taken, and whether recalibration was necessary (along with all pertinent records and charts) shall be submitted. If more than one malfunction occurs, all performance test procedures for all parameters shall be repeated.</P>
              <P>(e) Tests for all performance parameters shall be completed on the same test analyzer; however, use of multiple test analyzers to accelerate testing is permissible for testing additional ranges of a multi-range candidate method.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Generation of test atmospheres.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Table B-2 to subpart B of part 53 specifies preferred methods for generating test atmospheres and suggested methods of verifying their concentrations. Only one means of establishing the concentration of a test atmosphere is normally required, provided that that means is adequately accurate and credible. If the method of generation can produce accurate, reproducible concentrations, verification is optional. If the method of generation is <PRTPAGE P="24"/>not reproducible or reasonably quantifiable, then establishment of the concentration by some credible verification method is required.</P>
              <P>(b) The test atmosphere delivery system shall be designed and constructed so as not to significantly alter the test atmosphere composition or concentration during the period of the test. The system shall be vented to insure that test atmospheres are presented to the test analyzer at very nearly atmospheric pressure. The delivery system shall be fabricated from borosilicate glass, FEP Teflon, or other material that is inert with regard to the gas or gases to be used.</P>
              <P>(c) The output of the test atmosphere generation system shall be sufficiently stable to obtain stable response readings from the test analyzer during the required tests. If a permeation device is used for generation of a test atmosphere, the device, as well as the air passing over it, shall be controlled to 0.1 °C.</P>
              <P>(d) All diluent air shall be zero air free of contaminants likely to react with the test atmospheres or cause a detectable response on the test analyzer.</P>
              <P>(e) The concentration of each test atmosphere used shall be quantitatively established and/or verified before or during each series of tests. Samples for verifying test concentrations shall be collected from the test atmosphere delivery system as close as feasible to the sample intake port of the test analyzer.</P>

              <P>(f) The accuracy of all flow measurements used to calculate test atmosphere concentrations shall be documented and referenced to a primary flow rate or volume standard (such as a spirometer, bubble meter, <E T="03">etc.</E>). Any corrections shall be clearly shown. All flow measurements given in volume units shall be standardized to 25 °C and 760 mm Hg.</P>
              <P>(g) Schematic drawings, photos, descriptions, and other information showing complete procedural details of the test atmosphere generation, verification, and delivery system shall be provided. All pertinent calculations shall be clearly indicated.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> The test analyzer shall be tested for all substances likely to cause a detectable response. The test analyzer shall be challenged, in turn, with each potential interfering agent (interferent) specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53. In the event that there are substances likely to cause a significant interference which have not been specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53, these substances shall also be tested, in a manner similar to that for the specified interferents, at a concentration substantially higher than that likely to be found in the ambient air. The interference may be either positive or negative, depending on whether the test analyzer's measurement response is increased or decreased by the presence of the interferent. Interference equivalents shall be determined by mixing each interferent, one at a time, with the pollutant at an interferent test concentration not lower than the test concentration specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53 (or as otherwise required for unlisted interferents), and comparing the test analyzer's measurement response to the response caused by the pollutant alone. Known gas-phase reactions that might occur between a listed interferent and the pollutant are designated by footnote 3 in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53. In these cases, the interference equivalent shall be determined without mixing with the pollutant.<PRTPAGE P="26"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Allow sufficient time for warm-up and stabilization of the test analyzer.</P>

              <P>(ii) For a candidate method using a prefilter or scrubber device based upon a chemical reaction to derive part of its specificity and which device requires periodic service or maintenance, the test analyzer shall be “conditioned” prior to conducting each interference test series. This requirement includes conditioning for the NO<E T="52">2</E> converter in chemiluminescence NO/NO<E T="52">2</E>/NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzers and for the ozone scrubber in UV-absorption ozone analyzers. Conditioning is as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Service or perform the indicated maintenance on the scrubber or prefilter device, as if it were due for such maintenance, as directed in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(B) Before testing for each potential interferent, allow the test analyzer to sample through the prefilter or scrubber device a test atmosphere containing the interferent at a concentration not lower than the value specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53 (or, for unlisted potential interferents, at a concentration substantially higher than likely to be found in ambient air). Sampling shall be at the normal flow rate and shall be continued for 6 continuous hours prior to the interference test series. Conditioning for all applicable interferents prior to any of the interference tests is permissible. Also permissible is simultaneous conditioning with multiple interferents, provided no interferent reactions are likely to occur in the conditioning system.</P>
              <P>(iii) Generate three test atmosphere streams as follows:</P>

              <P>(B) The concentration of the pollutant in test atmosphere <E T="03">P</E> shall be adjusted such that when <E T="03">P</E> is mixed (diluted) with either test atmosphere <E T="03">I</E> or <E T="03">Z,</E> the resulting concentration of pollutant shall be as specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53.</P>

              <P>(C) The concentration of the interferent in test atmosphere <E T="03">I</E> shall be adjusted such that when <E T="03">I</E> is mixed (diluted) with test atmosphere <E T="03">P,</E> the resulting concentration of interferent shall be not less than the value specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53 (or as otherwise required for unlisted potential interferents).</P>

              <P>(D) To minimize concentration errors due to flow rate differences between <E T="03">I</E> and <E T="03">Z,</E> it is recommended that, when possible, the flow rate of <E T="03">P</E> be from 10 to 20 times larger than the flow rates of <E T="03">I</E> and <E T="03">Z.</E>

              <P>(xi) For those potential interferents which cannot be mixed with the pollutant, as indicated by footnote (3) in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53, adjust the concentration of test atmosphere <E T="03">I</E> to the specified value without being mixed or diluted by the pollutant test atmosphere.

              <P>(2) Tests for these performance parameters shall be accomplished over a period of seven (7) or fifteen (15) test days. During this time, the line voltage supplied to the test analyzer and the ambient temperature surrounding the analyzer shall be changed from day to day, as required in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. One test result for each performance parameter shall be obtained each test day, for seven (7) or fifteen (15) test days, as determined from the test results of the first seven days. The tests for each test day are performed in a single integrated procedure.</P>
              <P>(3) The 24-hour test day may begin at any clock hour. The first approximately 12 hours of each test day are required for testing 12-hour zero drift. Tests for the other parameters shall be conducted any time during the remaining 12 hours.</P>

              <P>(4) Table B-4 to subpart B of part 53 specifies the line voltage and room temperature to be used for each test day. The applicant may elect to specify a wider temperature range (minimum and maximum temperatures) than the range specified in table B-4 to subpart B of part 53 and to conduct these tests over that wider temperature range in lieu of the specified temperature range. If the test results show that all test parameters of this section § 53.23(e) are passed over this wider temperature range, a subsequent FRM or FEM designation for the candidate method based in part on this test shall indicate approval for operation of the method over such wider temperature range. The line voltage and temperature shall be changed to the specified values (or to the alternative, wider temperature values, if applicable) at the start of each test day (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> at the start of the 12-hour zero test). Initial adjustments (day zero) shall be made at a line voltage of 115 volts (rms) and a room temperature of 25 °C.</P>

              <P>(5) The tests shall be conducted in blocks consisting of 3 test days each until 7 (or 15, if necessary) test results have been obtained. (The final block may contain fewer than three test days.) Test days need not be contiguous days, but during any idle time between tests or test days, the test analyzer must operate continuously and measurements must be recorded continuously at a low chart speed (or <PRTPAGE P="28"/>equivalent data recording) and included with the test data. If a test is interrupted by an occurrence other than a malfunction of the test analyzer, only the block during which the interruption occurred shall be repeated.</P>
              <P>(6) During each test block, manual adjustments to the electronics, gas, or reagent flows or periodic maintenance shall not be permitted. Automatic adjustments that the test analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time.</P>
              <P>(7) At least 4 hours prior to the start of the first test day of each test block, the test analyzer may be adjusted and/or serviced according to the periodic maintenance procedures specified in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). If a new block is to immediately follow a previous block, such adjustments or servicing may be done immediately after completion of the day's tests for the last day of the previous block and at the voltage and temperature specified for that day, but only on test days 3, 6, 9, and 12.</P>

              </NOTE>
              <P>(8) All measurement response readings to be recorded shall be converted to concentration units or adjusted (if necessary) according to the calibration curve. Whenever a test atmosphere is to be measured but a stable reading is not required, the test atmosphere shall be sampled and measured long enough to cause a change in measurement response of at least 10% of full scale. Identify all readings and other pertinent data on the strip chart (or equivalent test data record). (See Figure B-1 to subpart B of part 53 illustrating the pattern of the required readings.)</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination of comparability.</E> The test procedures prescribed in this subpart shall be used to determine if a candidate method is comparable to a reference method when both methods measure pollutant concentrations in ambient air. Minor deviations in testing requirements and acceptance requirements set forth in this subpart, in connection with any documented extenuating circumstances, may be determined by the Administrator to be acceptable, at the discretion of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Selection of test sites.</E> (1) Each test site shall be in an area which can be shown to have at least moderate concentrations of various pollutants. Each site shall be clearly identified and shall be justified as an appropriate test site with suitable supporting evidence such as a description of the surrounding <PRTPAGE P="40"/>area, characterization of the sources and pollutants typical in the area, maps, population density data, vehicular traffic data, emission inventories, pollutant measurements from previous years, concurrent pollutant measurements, meteorological data, and other information useful in supporting the suitability of the site for the comparison test or tests.</P>
              <P>(2) If approval of one or more proposed test sites is desired prior to conducting the tests, a written request for approval of the test site or sites must be submitted to the address given in § 53.4. The request should include information identifying the type of candidate method and one or more specific proposed test sites along with a justification for each proposed specific site as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The EPA will evaluate each proposed site and approve the site, disapprove the site, or request more information about the site. Any such pre-test approval of a test site by the EPA shall indicate only that the site meets the applicable test site requirements for the candidate method type; it shall not indicate, suggest, or imply that test data obtained at the site will necessarily meet any of the applicable data acceptance requirements. The Administrator may exercise discretion in selecting a different site (or sites) for any additional tests the Administrator decides to conduct.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test atmosphere.</E> Ambient air sampled at an appropriate test site or sites shall be used for these tests. Simultaneous concentration measurements shall be made in each of the concentration ranges specified in tables C-1, C-3, or C-4 of this subpart, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Sampling or sample collection.</E> All test concentration measurements or samples shall be taken in such a way that both the candidate method and the reference method obtain air samples that are alike or as nearly identical as practical.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Operation.</E> Set-up and start-up of the test analyzer(s), test sampler(s), and reference method analyzers or samplers shall be in strict accordance with the applicable operation manual(s).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Calibration.</E> The reference method shall be calibrated according to the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter (if it is a manual method) or according to the applicable operation manual(s) (if it is an automated method). A candidate method (or portion thereof) shall be calibrated according to the applicable operation manual(s), if such calibration is a part of the method.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Submission of test data and other information.</E> All recorder charts, calibration data, records, test results, procedural descriptions and details, and other documentation obtained from (or pertinent to) these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and submitted. For candidate methods for PM <E T="52">2.5</E> and PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E>, all submitted information must meet the requirements of the ANSI/ASQC E4 Standard, sections 6 (reference 1 of appendix A of this subpart).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Comparability.</E> Comparability is shown for SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO, O<E T="52">3</E>, and NO<E T="52">2</E> methods when the differences between:</P>
              <P>(1) Measurements made by a candidate manual method or by a test analyzer representative of a candidate automated method, and;</P>
              <P>(2) Measurements made simultaneously by a reference method are less than or equal to the values for maximum discrepancy specified in table C-1 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Test measurements.</E> All test measurements are to be made at the same test site. If necessary, the concentration of pollutant in the sampled ambient air may be augmented with artificially generated pollutant to facilitate measurements in the specified ranges, as described under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for measurements or samples.</E> All test measurements made or test samples collected by means of a sample manifold as specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section shall be at a room temperature between 20° and 30 °C, and at a line voltage between 105 and 125 volts. All methods shall be calibrated as specified in § 53.30(f) prior to initiation of the tests.<PRTPAGE P="41"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Set-up and start-up.</E> (1) Set-up and start-up of the test analyzer, test sampler(s), and reference method shall be in strict accordance with the applicable operation manual(s). If the test analyzer does not have an integral strip chart or digital data recorder, connect the analyzer output to a suitable strip chart or digital data recorder. This recorder shall have a chart width of at least 25 centimeters, a response time of 1 second or less, a deadband of not more than 0.25 percent of full scale, and capability of either reading measurements at least 5 percent below zero or offsetting the zero by at least 5 percent. Digital data shall be recorded at appropriate time intervals such that trend plots similar to a strip chart recording may be constructed with a similar or suitable level of detail.</P>
              <P>(2) Other data acquisition components may be used along with the chart recorder during the conduct of these tests. Use of the chart recorder is intended only to facilitate visual evaluation of data submitted.</P>
              <P>(3) Allow adequate warmup or stabilization time as indicated in the applicable operation manual(s) before beginning the tests.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Range.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each method shall be operated in the range specified for the reference method in the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter (for manual reference methods), or specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part (for automated reference methods).</P>

              <P>(2) For a candidate method having more than one selectable range, one range must be that specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, and a test analyzer representative of the method must pass the tests required by this subpart while operated on that range. The tests may be repeated for one or more broader ranges (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> ones extending to higher concentrations) than the one specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, provided that such a range does not extend to concentrations more than four times the upper range limit specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part and that the test analyzer has passed the tests required by subpart B of this part (if applicable) for the broader range. If the tests required by this subpart are conducted or passed only for the range specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, any equivalent method determination with respect to the method will be limited to that range. If the tests are passed for both the specified range and a broader range (or ranges), any such determination will include the broader range(s) as well as the specified range. Appropriate test data shall be submitted for each range sought to be included in such a determination.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Operation of automated methods.</E> (1) Once the test analyzer has been set up and calibrated and tests started, manual adjustment or normal periodic maintenance, as specified in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3), is permitted only every 3 days. Automatic adjustments which the test analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time. The submitted records shall show clearly when manual adjustments were made and describe the operations performed.</P>
              <P>(2) All test measurements shall be made with the same test analyzer; use of multiple test analyzers is not permitted. The test analyzer shall be operated continuously during the entire series of test measurements.</P>
              <P>(3) If a test analyzer should malfunction during any of these tests, the entire set of measurements shall be repeated, and a detailed explanation of the malfunction, remedial action taken, and whether recalibration was necessary (along with all pertinent records and charts) shall be submitted.</P>

              <P>(4) Ambient air shall be sampled from a common intake and distribution manifold designed to deliver homogenous air samples to both methods. Precautions shall be taken in the design and construction of this manifold to minimize the removal of particulate matter and trace gases, and to insure that identical samples reach the two methods. If necessary, the concentration of pollutant in the sampled ambient air may be augmented with artificially generated pollutant. However, at all times the air sample measured by the candidate and reference methods under test shall consist of not less than 80 percent ambient air by volume. <PRTPAGE P="42"/>Schematic drawings, physical illustrations, descriptions, and complete details of the manifold system and the augmentation system (if used) shall be submitted.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Tests.</E> (1) Conduct the first set of simultaneous measurements with the candidate and reference methods:</P>
              <P>(i) Table C-1 of this subpart specifies the type (1-or 24-hour) and number of measurements to be made in each of the three test concentration ranges.</P>
              <P>(ii) The pollutant concentration must fall within the specified range as measured by the reference method.</P>
              <P>(iii) The measurements shall be made in the sequence specified in table C-2 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) For each pair of measurements, determine the difference (discrepancy) between the candidate method measurement and reference method measurement. A discrepancy which exceeds the discrepancy specified in table C-1 of this subpart constitutes a failure. Figure C-1 of this subpart contains a suggested format for reporting the test results.</P>
              <P>(3) The results of the first set of measurements shall be interpreted as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero failures: The candidate method passes the test for comparability.</P>
              <P>(ii) Three or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for comparability.</P>
              <P>(iii) One or two failures: Conduct a second set of simultaneous measurements as specified in table C-1 of this subpart. The results of the combined total of first-set and second-set measurements shall be interpreted as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) One or two failures: The candidate method passes the test for comparability.</P>
              <P>(B) Three or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for comparability.</P>
              <P>(iv) For SO<E T="52">2</E>, the 1-hour and 24-hour measurements shall be interpreted separately, and the candidate method must pass the tests for both 1- and 24-hour measurements to pass the test for comparability.</P>
              <P>(4) A 1-hour measurement consists of the integral of the instantaneous concentration over a 60-minute continuous period divided by the time period. Integration of the instantaneous concentration may be performed by any appropriate means such as chemical, electronic, mechanical, visual judgment, or by calculating the mean of not less than 12 equally-spaced instantaneous readings. Appropriate allowances or corrections shall be made in cases where significant errors could occur due to characteristic lag time or rise/fall time differences between the candidate and reference methods. Details of the means of integration and any corrections shall be submitted.</P>
              <P>(5) A 24-hour measurement consists of the integral of the instantaneous concentration over a 24-hour continuous period divided by the time period. This integration may be performed by any appropriate means such as chemical, electronic, mechanical, or by calculating the mean of twenty-four (24) sequential 1-hour measurements.</P>
              <P>(6) For O<E T="52">3</E> and CO, no more than six 1-hour measurements shall be made per day. For SO<E T="52">2</E>, no more than four 1-hour measurements or one 24-hour measurement shall be made per day. One-hour measurements may be made concurrently with 24-hour measurements if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(7) For applicable methods, control or calibration checks may be performed once per day without adjusting the test analyzer or method. These checks may be used as a basis for a linear interpolation-type correction to be applied to the measurements to correct for drift. If such a correction is used, it shall be applied to all measurements made with the method, and the correction procedure shall become a part of the method.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test Procedure for Methods for Lead (Pb).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The reference method for Pb in TSP includes two parts, the reference method for high-volume sampling of TSP as specified in 40 CFR 50, appendix B and the analysis method for Pb in TSP as specified in 40 CFR 50, appendix G. Correspondingly, the reference method for Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E> includes the reference method for low-volume <PRTPAGE P="43"/>sampling of PM <E T="52">10</E> in 40 CFR 50, appendix O and the analysis method of Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E> as specified in 40 CFR 50, appendix Q. This section explains the procedures for demonstrating the equivalence of either a candidate method for Pb in TSP to the high-volume reference methods, or a candidate method for Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E> to the low-volume reference methods.</P>
              <P>(1) Pb in TSP—A candidate method for Pb in TSP specifies reporting of Pb concentrations in terms of standard temperature and pressure. Comparisons of candidate methods to the reference method in 40 CFR 50, appendix G must be made in a consistent manner with regard to temperature and pressure.</P>
              <P>(2) Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E>—A candidate method for Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E> must specify reporting of Pb concentrations in terms of local conditions of temperature and pressure, which will be compared to similarly reported concentrations from the reference method in 40 CFR 50 appendix Q.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Comparability.</E> Comparability is shown for Pb methods when the differences between:</P>
              <P>(1) Measurements made by a candidate method, and</P>
              <P>(2) Measurements made by the reference method on simultaneously collected Pb samples (or the same sample, if applicable), are less than or equal to the values specified in table C-3 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test measurements.</E> Test measurements may be made at any number of test sites. Augmentation of pollutant concentrations is not permitted, hence an appropriate test site or sites must be selected to provide Pb concentrations in the specified range.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Collocated samplers.</E> The ambient air intake points of all the candidate and reference method collocated samplers shall be positioned at the same height above the ground level, and between 2 meters (1 meter for samplers with flow rates less than 200 liters per minute (L/min)) and 4 meters apart. The samplers shall be oriented in a manner that will minimize spatial and wind directional effects on sample collection.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Sample collection.</E> Collect simultaneous 24-hour samples of Pb at the test site or sites with both the reference and candidate methods until at least 10 sample pairs have been obtained.</P>
              <P>(1) A candidate method for Pb in TSP which employs a sampler and sample collection procedure that are identical to the sampler and sample collection procedure specified in the reference method in 40 CFR part 50, Appendix B, but uses a different analytical procedure than specified in 40 CFR Appendix G, may be tested by analyzing pairs of filter strips taken from a single TSP reference sampler operated according to the procedures specified by that reference method.</P>
              <P>(2) A candidate method for Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E> which employs a sampler and sample collection procedure that are identical to the sampler and sample collection procedure specified in the reference method in 40 CFR part 50, Appendix O, but uses a different analytical procedure than specified in 40 CFR Appendix Q, requires the use of two PM <E T="52">10</E> reference samplers because a single 46.2-mm filter from a reference sampler may not be divided prior to analysis. It is possible to analyze a 46.2-mm filter first with the non-destructive X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) FRM and subsequently extract the filter for other analytical techniques. If the filter is subject to XRF with subsequent extraction for other analyses, then a single PM <E T="52">10</E> reference sampler may be used for sample collection.</P>
              <P>(3) A candidate method for Pb in TSP or Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E> which employs a direct reading (e.g., continuous or semi-continuous sampling) method that uses the same sampling inlet and flow rate as the FRM and the same or different analytical procedure may be tested. The direct measurements are then aggregated to 24-hour equivalent concentrations for comparison with the FRM. For determining precision in section (k), two collocated direct reading devices must be used.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Audit samples.</E> Three audit samples must be obtained from the address given in § 53.4(a). For Pb in TSP collected by the high-volume sampling method, the audit samples are <FR>3/4</FR> × 8-inch glass fiber strips containing known amounts of Pb in micrograms per strip (µg/strip) equivalent to the following nominal percentages of the <PRTPAGE P="44"/>National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS): 30%, 100%, and 250%. For Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E> collected by the low-volume sampling method, the audit samples are 46.2-mm polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) filters containing known amounts of Pb in micrograms per filter (µg/filter) equivalent to the same percentages of the NAAQS: 30%, 100%, and 250%. The true amount of Pb (Tqi), in total µg/strip (for TSP) or total µg/filter (for PM <E T="52">10</E>), will be provided for each audit sample.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Filter analysis.</E> (1) For both the reference method samples (e) and the audit samples (f), analyze each filter or filter extract three times in accordance with the reference method analytical procedure. This applies to both the Pb in TSP and Pb in PM <E T="52">10</E> methods. The analysis of replicates should not be performed sequentially, i.e., a single sample should not be analyzed three times in sequence. Calculate the indicated Pb concentrations for the reference method samples in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<SU>3</SU>) for each analysis of each filter. Calculate the indicated total Pb amount for the audit samples in µg/strip for each analysis of each strip or µg/filter for each analysis of each audit filter. Label these test results as R<E T="52">1A</E>, R<E T="52">1B</E>, R<E T="52">1C</E>, R<E T="52">2A</E>, R<E T="52">2B</E>, etc., Q<E T="52">1A</E>, Q<E T="52">1B</E>, Q<E T="52">1C</E>, etc., where R denotes results from the reference method samples; Q denotes results from the audit samples; 1, 2, 3 indicate the filter number, and A, B, C indicate the first, second, and third analysis of each filter, respectively.</P>

              <P>(2) For the candidate method samples, analyze each sample filter or filter extract three times and calculate, in accordance with the candidate method, the indicated Pb concentration in µg/m <SU>3</SU> for each analysis of each filter. The analysis of replicates should not be performed sequentially. Label these test results as C<E T="52">1A</E>, C<E T="52">1B</E>, C<E T="52">2C</E>, etc., where C denotes results from the candidate method. For candidate methods which provide a direct reading or measurement of Pb concentrations without a separable procedure, C<E T="52">1A</E> = C<E T="52">1B</E> = C<E T="52">1C</E>, C<E T="52">2A</E> = C<E T="52">2B</E> = C<E T="52">2C</E>, etc.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Average Pb concentration.</E> For the reference method, calculate the average Pb concentration for each filter by averaging the concentrations calculated from the three analyses as described in (g)(1) using equation 1 of this section:</P>

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Analytical Bias.</E> (1) For the audit samples, calculate the average Pb concentration for each strip or filter analyzed by the reference method by averaging the concentrations calculated from the three analyses as described in (g)(1) using equation 2 of this section:</P>

              <P>(2) Calculate the percent difference (D<E T="52">q</E>) between the average Pb concentration for each audit sample and the true Pb concentration (T<E T="52">q</E>) using equation 3 of this section:</P>
              <MATH DEEP="47" SPAN="1">
                <MID>ER12NO08.005</MID>
              </MATH>
              <P>(3) If any difference value (D<E T="52">qi</E>) exceeds ±5 percent, the bias of the reference method analytical procedure is out-of-control. Corrective action must be taken to determine the source of the error(s) (e.g., calibration standard discrepancies, extraction problems, etc.) and the reference method and audit sample determinations must be repeated according to paragraph (g) of this section, or the entire test procedure (starting with paragraph (e) of this section) must be repeated.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Acceptable filter pairs.</E> Disregard all filter pairs for which the Pb concentration, as determined in paragraph (h) of this section by the average of the three reference method determinations, falls outside the range of 30% to 250% of the Pb NAAQS level in µg/m<SU>3</SU> for Pb in both TSP and PM <E T="52">10</E>. All remaining filter pairs must be subjected to the tests for precision and comparability in paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section. At <PRTPAGE P="45"/>least five filter pairs must be within the specified concentration range for the tests to be valid.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Test for precision.</E> (1) Calculate the precision (P) of the analysis (in percent) for each filter and for each method, as the maximum minus the minimum divided by the average of the three concentration values, using equation 4 or equation 5 of this section:</P>

All reference method samplers shall be of single-filter design (not multi-filter, sequential sample design). Each candidate method shall be setup and operated in accordance with its associated manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3) and in accordance with applicable guidance in “Quality Assurance Document 2.12” (reference (2) in appendix A to this subpart). All samplers or analyzers shall be placed so that they sample or measure air representative of the surrounding area (within one kilometer) and are not unduly affected by adjacent buildings, air handling equipment, industrial operations, traffic, or other local influences. The ambient air inlet points of all samplers and analyzers shall be positioned at the same height above the ground level and between 2 meters (1 meter for instruments having sample inlet flow rates less than 200 L/min) and 4 meters apart.</P>

To be considered acceptable for the test, each measurement set shall consist of at least two valid reference method measurements and at least two valid candidate method measurements, and the PM <E T="52">2.5</E> or PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> measured concentration, as determined by the average of the reference method measurements, must fall within the acceptable concentration range specified in table C-4 of this subpart. Each measurement set shall include all valid measurements obtained. For each measurement set containing fewer than three reference method measurements or fewer than three candidate method measurements, an explanation and appropriate justification shall be provided to account for the missing measurement or measurements.</P>
              <P>(3) More than 23 valid measurement sets may be obtained during a particular test campaign to provide a more advantageous range of concentrations, more representative conditions, additional higher or lower measurements, or to otherwise improve the comparison of the methods. All valid data sets obtained during each test campaign shall be submitted and shall be included in the analysis of the data.</P>

              <P>(4) The integrated-sample reference method measurements shall be of at least 22 hours and not more than 25 hours duration. Each reference method sample shall be retrieved promptly after sample collection and analyzed according to the reference method to determine the PM <E T="52">2.5</E> or PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> measured concentration in µg/m<SU>3</SU>.

              <P>(5) Candidate method measurements shall be timed or processed and averaged as appropriate to determine an equivalent mean concentration representative of the same time period as that of the concurrent integrated-sample reference method measurements, such that all measurements in a measurement set shall be representative of the same time period. In addition, hourly average concentration measurements shall be obtained from each of the Class III candidate method analyzers for each valid measurement set and submitted as part of the application records.</P>

              <P>(6) In the following tests, all measurement sets obtained at a particular test site, from both seasonal campaigns if applicable, shall be combined and included in the test data analysis for the site. Data obtained at different test sites shall be analyzed separately. All measurements should be reported as <PRTPAGE P="50"/>normally obtained, and no measurement values should be rounded or truncated prior to data analysis. In particular, no negative measurement value, if otherwise apparently valid, should be modified, adjusted, replaced, or eliminated merely because its value is negative. Calculated mean concentrations or calculated intermediate quantities should retain at least one order-of-magnitude greater resolution than the input values. All measurement data and calculations shall be recorded and submitted in accordance with § 53.30(g), including hourly test measurements obtained from Class III candidate methods.</P>

              <P>(iv) If this test indicates that one of the reference method measurements in the measurement set is an outlier, the outlier measurement shall be eliminated from the measurement set, and the other two measurements considered valid. If the test indicates that more than one reference method measurement in the measurement set is an outlier, the entire measurement set (both reference and candidate method measurements) shall be excluded from further data analysis for the tests of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The test procedures prescribed in this subpart shall be used to test the performance of candidate methods for PM <E T="52">10</E> against the performance specifications given in table D-1. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a test sampler or samplers representative of the sampler described in the candidate method must exhibit performance better than, or equal to, the specified value for each performance parameter, to satisfy the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) For a candidate method using a PM <E T="52">10</E> sampler previously approved as part of a designated PM <E T="52">10</E> method, only the test for precision need be conducted and passed to satisfy the requirements of this subpart. For a candidate method using a PM <E T="52">10</E> sampler inlet previously approved as part of a designated PM <E T="52">10</E> method, the tests for precision and flow rate stability must be conducted and passed to satisfy the requirements of this subpart; the tests for sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint need not be conducted if suitable rationale is provided to demonstrate that test results submitted for the previously approved method are applicable to the candidate method.</P>

              <P>(c) The liquid particle sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint of a test sampler shall be determined in a wind tunnel using 10 particle sizes and three wind speeds as specified in table D-2. A minimum of 3 replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness shall be required for each of the 30 test <PRTPAGE P="58"/>conditions for a minimum of 90 test measurements.</P>
              <P>(d) For the liquid particle sampling effectiveness parameter, a smooth curve plot shall be constructed of sampling effectiveness (percent) versus aerodynamic particle diameter (µm) for each of the three wind speeds. These plots shall be used to calculate the expected mass concentration for the test sampler, using the procedure in § 53.43(a). The candidate method passes the liquid particle sampling effectiveness test if the expected mass concentration calculated for the test sampler at each wind speed differs by no more than ±10 percent from that predicted for the “ideal” sampler.*<FTREF/>
              </P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>* The sampling effectiveness curve for this “ideal” sampler is described by column 5 of table D-3 and is based on a model that approximates the penetration of particles into the human respiratory tract. Additional information on this model may be found in a document entitled, “Particle Collection Criteria for 10 Micrometer Samplers,” which is available from the Quality Assurance Division (MD-77), Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(e) For the 50 percent cutpoint parameter, the test result for each wind speed shall be reported as the particle size at which the curve specified in § 53.40(d) crosses the 50 percent effectiveness line. The candidate method passes the 50 percent cutpoint test if the test result at each wind speed falls within 10±0.5 µm.</P>
              <P>(f) The solid particle sampling effectiveness of a test sampler shall be determined in a wind tunnel using 25 µm particles at 2 wind speeds as specified in table D-2. A minimum of three replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness for the 25 µm solid particles shall be required at both wind speeds for a minimum of 6 test measurements.</P>

              <FP>If the value of CV<E T="52">iso(i)</E> exceeds 0.10, the particle concentration uniformity is unacceptable and steps (vi) through (ix) must be repeated. If adjustment of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator or changes in the particle delivery system are necessary to achieve uniformity, steps (ii) through (ix) must be repeated. Remove the array of isokinetic samplers from the wind tunnel. NOTE: A single isokinetic sampler, operated at the same nominal flow rate as the test sampler, may be used in place of the array of isokinetic samplers for the determination of particle mass concentration used in the calculation of sampling effectiveness of the test sampler in step (xiii). In this case, the <PRTPAGE P="62"/>array of isokinetic samplers must be used to demonstrate particle concentration uniformity prior to the replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.</FP>

              <P>(x) If a single isokinetic sampler is used, install the sampler in the wind tunnel with the sampler nozzle centered in the sampling zone (see § 53.42(d)). Collect particles on an appropriate filter (e.g., glass fiber) for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration (as defined in step (vi)) is less than 5 percent. Determine the quantity of material collected with the isokinetic sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration as C<E T="52">iso(i)</E> as in step vii. Remove the isokinetic sampler from the wind tunnel.</P>
              <P>(xi) Install the test sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind tunnel with the sampler inlet opening centered in the sampling zone (see § 53.42(d)). To meet the maximum blockage limit of § 53.42(a) or for convenience, part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles on an appropriate filter or filters (e.g., glass fiber) for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration (as defined in step (vi)) is less than 5 percent.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> (1) Paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section specify certain documentation that must be submitted and tests that are required to demonstrate that samplers associated with a designated FRM or FEM for PM <E T="52">2.5</E> or PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> are properly manufactured to meet all applicable design and performance specifications and have been properly tested according to all applicable test requirements for such designation. Documentation is required to show that instruments and components of a PM <E T="52">2.5</E> or PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> sampler are manufactured in an ISO 9001-registered facility under a quality system that meets ISO-9001 requirements for manufacturing quality control and testing.</P>
              <P>(2) In addition, specific tests are required by paragraph (d) of this section to verify that critical features of FRM samplers—the particle size separator and the surface finish of surfaces specified to be anodized—meet the specifications of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or appendix O, as applicable. A checklist is required to provide certification by an ISO-certified auditor that all performance and other required tests have been properly and appropriately conducted, based on a reasonable and appropriate sample of the actual operations or their documented records. Following designation of the method, another checklist is required initially to provide an ISO-certified auditor's certification that the sampler manufacturing process is being implemented under an adequate and appropriate quality system.</P>

              <P>(3) For the purposes of this section, the definitions of ISO 9001-registered facility and ISO-certified auditor are found in § 53.1. An exception to the reliance by EPA on ISO-certified auditors is the requirement for the submission of the operation or instruction manual associated with the candidate method to EPA as part of the application. This manual is required under § 53.4(b)(3). The EPA has determined that acceptable technical judgment for review of this manual may not be assured by ISO-certified auditors, and approval of this manual will therefore be performed by EPA.<PRTPAGE P="68"/>

              <SUBJECT>Test for flow rate accuracy, regulation, measurement accuracy, and cut-off.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This test procedure is designed to evaluate a candidate sampler's flow rate accuracy with respect to the design flow rate, flow rate regulation, flow rate measurement accuracy, coefficient of variability measurement accuracy, and the flow rate cut-off function. The tests for the first four parameters shall be conducted over a 6-hour time period during which reference flow measurements are made at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. The flow rate cut-off test, conducted separately, is intended to verify that the sampler carries out the required automatic sample flow rate cut-off function properly in the event of a low-flow condition. The test conditions and performance specifications associated with this test are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. The candidate test sampler must meet all test parameters and test specifications to successfully pass this test.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical definitions.</E> (1) Sample flow rate means the quantitative volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the sampler to enter the sampler inlet and pass through the <PRTPAGE P="71"/>sample filter, measured in actual volume units at the temperature and pressure of the air as it enters the inlet.</P>
              <P>(2) The flow rate cut-off function requires the sampler to automatically stop sample flow and terminate the current sample collection if the sample flow rate deviates by more than the variation limits specified in table E-1 of this subpart (±10 percent from the nominal sample flow rate) for more than 60 seconds during a sample collection period. The sampler is also required to properly notify the operator with a flag warning indication of the out-of-specification flow rate condition and if the flow rate cut-off results in an elapsed sample collection time of less than 23 hours.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Required test equipment.</E> (1) Flow rate meter, suitable for measuring and recording the actual volumetric sample flow rate at the sampler downtube, with a minimum range of 10 to 25 L/min, 2 percent certified, NIST-traceable accuracy. Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 30 seconds is recommended. While a flow meter which provides a direct indication of volumetric flow rate is preferred for this test, an alternative certified flow measurement device may be used as long as appropriate volumetric flow rate corrections are made based on measurements of actual ambient temperature and pressure conditions.</P>
              <P>(2) Ambient air temperature sensor, with a resolution of 0.1 °C and certified to be accurate to within 0.5 °C (if needed). If the certified flow meter does not provide direct volumetric flow rate readings, ambient air temperature measurements must be made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</P>
              <P>(3) Barometer, range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2 mm Hg (if needed). If the certified flow meter does not provide direct volumetric flow rate readings, ambient pressure measurements must be made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</P>
              <P>(4) Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sample flow rate at the sampler downtube.</P>
              <P>(5) Valve or other means to restrict or reduce the sample flow rate to a value at least 10 percent below the design flow rate (16.67 L/min). If appropriate, the valve of the flow measurement adaptor may be used for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(6) Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter, such as an orifice or flow restrictive plate installed in the filter holder or a valve or other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the flow path near the filter.</P>
              <P>(7) Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L (if required).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Calibration of test measurement instruments.</E> Submit documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy of flow-rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at zero and at least one flow rate within ±3 percent of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an instrument's measurements are to be recorded with an analog recording device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Test setup.</E> (1) Setup of the sampler shall be as required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in its normal configuration for collecting PM samples. A sample filter and (or) the device for creating an additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall be installed for the duration of these tests. The sampler's ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and flow rate measurement systems shall all be calibrated per the sampler's operation or instruction manual within 7 days prior to this test.<PRTPAGE P="72"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow measurement adaptor installed on the sampler's downtube. A leak check as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried out.</P>
              <P>(3) The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to the outlet of the flow rate meter.</P>
              <P>(4) For the flow rate cut-off test, the valve or means for reducing sampler flow rate shall be installed between the flow measurement adaptor and the downtube or in another location within the sampler such that the sampler flow rate can be manually restricted during the test.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> (1) Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e) of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or instruction manual. Set the sampler to automatically start a 6-hour sample collection period at a convenient time.</P>
              <P>(2) During the 6-hour operational flow rate portion of the test, measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, ambient temperature and pressure shall be measured at the same frequency as that of the certified flow rate measurements. Note and record the actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test period.</P>
              <P>(3) Following completion of the 6-hour flow rate test period, install the flow rate reduction device and change the sampler flow rate recording frequency to intervals of not more than 30 seconds. Reset the sampler to start a new sample collection period. Manually restrict the sampler flow rate such that the sampler flow rate is decreased slowly over several minutes to a flow rate slightly less than the flow rate cut-off value (15.0 L/min). Maintain this flow rate for at least 2.0 minutes or until the sampler stops the sample flow automatically. Manually terminate the sample period, if the sampler has not terminated it automatically.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> (1) This test procedure is designed to test various sampler performance parameters under variations in ambient (barometric) pressure. Tests shall be conducted in a pressure-controlled environment over two 6-hour time periods during which reference pressure and flow rate measurements shall be made at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.

              <P>(i) Sample flow rate.</P>
              <P>(ii) Flow rate regulation.</P>
              <P>(iii) Flow rate measurement accuracy.</P>
              <P>(iv) Coefficient of variability measurement accuracy.</P>
              <P>(v) Ambient pressure measurement accuracy.</P>

Each performance parameter tested, as described or determined in the test procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance specification given. The candidate sampler must meet all specifications for the associated PM <E T="52">2.5</E> or PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> method (as applicable) to pass this test procedure.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical definition.</E> Sample flow rate means the quantitative volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the sampler to enter the sampler inlet and pass through the sample filter, measured in actual volume units at the temperature and pressure of the air as it enters the inlet.</P>

Henceforth, where the test procedures specify a test or environmental chamber, an alternative pressure-controlled environmental area or areas may be substituted, provided the test pressure requirements are met. Means for simulating ambient pressure using a closed-loop sample air system may also be approved for this test; such a proposed method for simulating the test pressure conditions may be described and submitted to EPA at the address given in § 53.4(a) prior to conducting the test for a specific individual determination of acceptability.</P>

Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes is recommended. While a flow meter which provides a direct indication of volumetric flow rate is preferred for this test, an alternative certified flow measurement device may be used as long as appropriate volumetric flow rate corrections are made based on measurements of actual ambient temperature and pressure conditions.</P>

              <P>(3) Ambient air temperature recorder (if needed for volumetric corrections to flow rate measurements) with a range −30 °C to = 50 °C, certified accurate to within 0.5 °C.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This test is intended to measure the candidate sampler's ability to prevent excessive overheating of the PM sample collection filter (or filters) under conditions of elevated solar insolation. The test evaluates radiative effects on filter temperature during a 4-hour period of active sampling as well as during a subsequent 4-hour non-sampling time period prior to filter retrieval. Tests shall be conducted in an environmental chamber which provides the proper radiant wavelengths and energies to adequately simulate the sun's radiant effects under clear conditions at sea level. For additional guidance on conducting solar radiative tests under controlled conditions, consult military standard specification 810-E (reference 6 in appendix A of this subpart). The performance parameters tested under this procedure, the corresponding minimum performance specifications, and the applicable test conditions are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart.

During the 4-hour sampling run, measure and record the radiant flux, ambient temperature, and filter temperature (all filter temperatures for sequential samplers) at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.</P>
              <P>(6) At the completion of the 4-hour sampling phase, terminate the sample period, if not terminated automatically by the sampler. Continue to measure and record the radiant flux, ambient temperature, and filter temperature or temperatures for 4 additional hours at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. At the completion of the 4-hour post-sampling period, discontinue the measurements and turn off the solar source.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This test is intended to determine the operational precision of the candidate sampler during a minimum of 10 days of field operation, using three collocated test samplers. Measurements of PM are made at a test site with all of the samplers and then compared to determine replicate precision. Candidate sequential samplers are also subject to a test for possible deposition of particulate matter on inactive filters during a period of storage in the sampler. This procedure is applicable to both reference and equivalent methods. In the case of equivalent methods, this test may be combined and conducted concurrently with the comparability test for equivalent methods (described in subpart C of this part), using three reference method samplers collocated with three candidate equivalent method samplers and meeting the applicable site and other requirements of subpart C of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical definition.</E> (1) Field precision is defined as the standard deviation or relative standard deviation of a set of PM measurements obtained concurrently with three or more collocated samplers in actual ambient air field operation.</P>
              <P>(2) Storage deposition is defined as the mass of material inadvertently deposited on a sample filter that is stored in a sequential sampler either prior to or subsequent to the active sample collection period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test site.</E> Any outdoor test site having PM <E T="52">2.5</E> (or PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E>, as applicable) concentrations that are reasonably uniform over the test area and that meet the minimum level requirement of paragraph (g)(2) of this section is acceptable for this test.</P>

The test samplers' inlet openings shall be located at the same height above ground and between 2 (1 for samplers with flow rates less than 200 L/min.) and 4 meters apart horizontally. The samplers shall be arranged or oriented in a manner that will minimize the spatial and wind directional effects on sample collection of one sampler on any other sampler.</P>

For sequential samplers, install a conditioned, preweighed specified filter in each available channel or station intended for automatic sequential sample filter collection (or at least five additional filters for magazine-type sequential samplers), as directed by the sampler's operation or instruction manual.

For sequential samplers, retrieve the additional stored (blank, unsampled) filters after at least 5 days (120 hours) storage in the sampler if the active samples are 24-hour samples, or after at least 10 days (240 hours) if the active samples are 48-hour samples.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) This subpart sets forth the specific requirements that a PM <E T="52">2.5</E> sampler associated with a candidate Class II equivalent method must meet to be designated as an equivalent method for PM <E T="52">2.5</E>. This subpart also sets forth the explicit test procedures that must be carried out and the test results, evidence, documentation, and other materials that must be provided to EPA to demonstrate that a sampler meets all specified requirements for designation as an equivalent method.</P>
              <P>(b) A candidate method described in an application for a FRM or FEM determination submitted under § 53.4 shall be determined by the EPA to be a Class II candidate equivalent method on the basis of the definition of a Class II FEM in § 53.1.</P>

              <P>(c) Any sampler associated with a Class II candidate equivalent method (Class II sampler) must meet all applicable requirements for FRM samplers <PRTPAGE P="91"/>or Class I FEM samplers specified in subpart E of this part, as appropriate. Except as provided in § 53.3(a)(3), a Class II PM <E T="52">2.5</E> sampler must meet the additional requirements as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, all Class II samplers are subject to the additional tests and performance requirements specified in § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), § 53.65 (loading test), and § 53.66 (volatility test). Alternative tests and performance requirements, as described in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, are optionally available for certain Class II samplers which meet the requirements for reference method or Class I equivalent method samplers given in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, and in subpart E of this part, except for specific deviations of the inlet, fractionator, or filter.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Inlet deviation.</E> A sampler which has been determined to be a Class II sampler solely because the design or construction of its inlet deviates from the design or construction of the inlet specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, for reference method samplers shall not be subject to the requirements of § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), provided that it meets all requirements of § 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), § 53.65 (loading test), and § 53.66 (volatility test).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Fractionator deviation.</E> A sampler which has been determined to be a Class II sampler solely because the design or construction of its particle size fractionator deviates from the design or construction of the particle size fractionator specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L for reference method samplers shall not be subject to the requirements of § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), provided that it meets all requirements of § 53.64 (static fractionator test), § 53.65 (loading test), and § 53.66 (volatility test).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Filter size deviation.</E> A sampler which has been determined to be a Class II sampler solely because its effective filtration area deviates from that of the reference method filter specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, for reference method samplers shall not be subject to the requirements of § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test) nor § 53.65 (loading test), provided it meets all requirements of § 53.66 (volatility test).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">The test specifications and acceptance criteria for each test are summarized in table F-1 of this subpart.</E> The candidate sampler must demonstrate performance that meets the acceptance criteria for each applicable test to be designated as an equivalent method.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Overview of various test procedures for Class II samplers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Full wind tunnel test.</E> This test procedure is designed to ensure that the candidate sampler's effectiveness (aspiration of an ambient aerosol and penetration of the sub 2.5-micron fraction to its sample filter) will be comparable to that of a reference method sampler. The candidate sampler is challenged at wind speeds of 2 and 24 km/hr with monodisperse aerosols of the size specified in table F-2 of this subpart. The experimental test results are then integrated with three idealized ambient distributions (typical, fine, and coarse) to yield the expected mass concentration measurement for each. The acceptance criteria are based on the results of this numerical analysis and the particle diameter for which the sampler effectiveness is 50 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Wind tunnel inlet aspiration test.</E> The wind tunnel inlet aspiration test directly compares the inlet of the candidate sampler to the inlet of a reference method sampler with the single-sized, liquid, monodisperse challenge aerosol specified in table F-2 of this subpart at wind speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr. The acceptance criteria, presented in table F-1 of this subpart, is based on the relative aspiration between the candidate inlet and the reference method inlet.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Static fractionator test.</E> The static fractionator test determines the effectiveness of the candidate sampler's 2.5-micron fractionator under static conditions for aerosols of the size specified in table F-2 of this subpart. The numerical analysis procedures and acceptance criteria are identical to those in the full wind tunnel test.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Loading test.</E> The loading test is conducted to ensure that the performance of a candidate sampler is not significantly affected by the amount of particulate deposited on its interior surfaces between periodic cleanings. <PRTPAGE P="92"/>The candidate sampler is artificially loaded by sampling a test environment containing aerosolized, standard test dust. The duration of the loading phase is dependent on both the time between cleaning as specified by the candidate method and the aerosol mass concentration in the test environment. After loading, the candidate's performance must then be evaluated by § 53.62 (full wind tunnel evaluation), § 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), or § 53.64 (static fractionator test). If the results of the appropriate test meet the criteria presented in table F-1 of this subpart, then the candidate sampler passes the loading test under the condition that it be cleaned at least as often as the cleaning frequency proposed by the candidate method and that has been demonstrated to be acceptable by this test.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Volatility test.</E> The volatility test challenges the candidate sampler with a polydisperse, semi-volatile liquid aerosol. This aerosol is simultaneously sampled by the candidate method sampler and a reference method sampler for a specified time period. Clean air is then passed through the samplers during a blow-off time period. Residual mass is then calculated as the weight of the filter after the blow-off phase is subtracted from the initial weight of the filter. Acceptance criteria are based on a comparison of the residual mass measured by the candidate sampler (corrected for flow rate variations from that of the reference method) to the residual mass measured by the reference method sampler for several specified clean air sampling time periods.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Test data.</E> All test data and other documentation obtained from or pertinent to these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and submitted to EPA as part of the equivalent method application. Schematic drawings of each particle delivery system and other information showing complete procedural details of the test atmosphere generation, verification, and delivery techniques for each test performed shall be submitted to EPA. All pertinent calculations shall be clearly presented. In addition, manufacturers are required to submit as part of the application, a Designation Testing Checklist (Figure F-1 of this subpart) which has been completed and signed by an ISO-certified auditor.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Solid particle generation.</E> (i) Solid particle tests performed in this subpart shall be conducted using particles composed of ammonium fluorescein. For use in the VOAG, liquid solutions of known volumetric concentration can be prepared by diluting fluorescein powder (C<E T="52">2</E>0H<E T="52">12</E>O<E T="52">5</E>, FW = 332.31, CAS 2321-07-5) with aqueous ammonia. Guidelines for preparation of fluorescein solutions of the desired volume concentration (C<E T="52">vol</E>) are presented by Vanderpool and Rubow (1988) (Reference 2 in appendix A of this subpart). For purposes of converting particle physical diameter to aerodynamic diameter, an ammonium fluorescein density of 1.35 g/cm<SU>3</SU> shall be used.<PRTPAGE P="94"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Mass deposits of ammonium fluorescein shall be extracted and analyzed using solutions of 0.01 N ammonium hydroxide.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Liquid particle generation.</E> (i) Tests prescribed in § 53.63 for inlet aspiration require the use of liquid particle tests composed of oleic acid tagged with uranine to enable subsequent fluorometric quantitation of collected aerosol mass deposits. Oleic acid (C<E T="52">18</E>H<E T="52">34</E>O<E T="52">2</E>, FW = 282.47, CAS 112-80-1) has a density of 0.8935 g/cm<SU>3</SU>. Because the viscosity of oleic acid is relatively high, significant errors can occur when dispensing oleic acid using volumetric pipettes. For this reason, it is recommended that oleic acid solutions be prepared by quantifying dispensed oleic acid gravimetrically. The volume of oleic acid dispensed can then be calculated simply by dividing the dispensed mass by the oleic acid density.</P>

              <P>(ii) Oleic acid solutions tagged with uranine shall be prepared as follows. A known mass of oleic acid shall first be diluted using absolute ethanol. The desired mass of the uranine tag should then be diluted in a separate container using absolute ethanol. Uranine (C<E T="52">20</E>H<E T="52">10</E>O<E T="52">5</E>Na<E T="52">2</E>, FW = 376.3, CAS 518-47-8) is the disodium salt of fluorescein and has a density of 1.53 g/cm<SU>3</SU>. In preparing uranine tagged oleic acid particles, the uranine content shall not exceed 20 percent on a mass basis. Once both oleic acid and uranine solutions are properly prepared, they can then be combined and diluted to final volume using absolute ethanol.</P>

              <P>(iii) Calculation of the physical diameter of the particles produced by the VOAG requires knowledge of the liquid solution's volume concentration (C<E T="52">vol</E>). Because uranine is essentially insoluble in oleic acid, the total particle volume is the sum of the oleic acid volume and the uranine volume. The volume concentration of the liquid solution shall be calculated as:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedure: Full wind tunnel test.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> The full wind tunnel test evaluates the effectiveness of the candidate sampler at 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr for aerosols of the size specified in table F-2 of this subpart (under the heading, “Full Wind Tunnel Test”). For each wind speed, a smooth curve is fit to the effectiveness data and corrected for the presence of multiplets in the wind tunnel calibration aerosol. The cutpoint diameter (D<E T="52">p50</E>) at each wind speed is then determined from the corrected effectiveness curves. The two resultant penetration curves are then each numerically integrated with three idealized ambient particle size distributions to provide six estimates of measured mass concentration. Critical parameters for these idealized distributions are presented in table F-3 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical definitions.</E> Effectiveness is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a specific size reaching the sampler filter or filters to the mass concentration of particles of the same size approaching the sampler.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Facilities and equipment required</E>—(1) <E T="03">Wind tunnel.</E> The particle delivery system shall consist of a blower system and a wind tunnel having a test section of sufficiently large cross-sectional <PRTPAGE P="95"/>area such that the test sampler, or portion thereof, as installed in the test section for testing, blocks no more than 15 percent of the test section area. The wind tunnel blower system must be capable of maintaining uniform wind speeds at the 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr in the test section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Aerosol generation system.</E> A vibrating orifice aerosol generator shall be used to produce monodisperse solid particles of ammonium fluorescein with equivalent aerodynamic diameters as specified in table F-2 of this subpart. The geometric standard deviation for each particle size generated shall not exceed 1.1 (for primary particles) and the proportion of multiplets (doublets and triplets) in all test particle atmosphere shall not exceed 10 percent of the particle population. The aerodynamic particle diameter, as established by the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator, shall be within the tolerance specified in table F-2 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Particle size verification equipment.</E> The size of the test particles shall be verified during this test by use of a suitable instrument (e.g., scanning electron microscope, optical particle sizer, time-of-flight apparatus). The instrument must be capable of measuring solid and liquid test particles with a size resolution of 0.1 µm or less. The accuracy of the particle size verification technique shall be 0.15 µm or better.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Wind speed measurement.</E> The wind speed in the wind tunnel shall be determined during the tests using an appropriate technique capable of a precision of 2 percent and an accuracy of 5 percent or better (e.g., hot-wire anemometry). For the wind speeds specified in table F-2 of this subpart, the wind speed shall be measured at a minimum of 12 test points in a cross-sectional area of the test section of the wind tunnel. The mean wind speed in the test section must be within ±10 percent of the value specified in table F-2 of this subpart, and the variation at any test point in the test section may not exceed 10 percent of the measured mean.</P>

Not less than five evenly spaced isokinetic samplers shall be used to determine the particle concentration spatial uniformity in the sampling zone. The sampling zone shall be a rectangular area having a horizontal dimension not less than 1.2 times the width of the test sampler at its inlet opening and a vertical dimension not less than 25 centimeters.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Total aerosol isokinetic sampler.</E> After cross-sectional uniformity has been confirmed, a single isokinetic sampler may be used in place of the array of isokinetic samplers for the determination of particle mass concentration used in the calculation of sampling effectiveness of the test sampler in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. In this case, the array of isokinetic samplers must be used to demonstrate particle concentration uniformity prior to the replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Fluorometer.</E> A fluorometer used for quantifying extracted aerosol mass deposits shall be set up, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. A series of calibration standards shall be prepared to encompass the minimum and maximum concentrations measured during size-selective tests. Prior to each calibration and measurement, the fluorometer shall be zeroed using an aliquot of the same solvent used for extracting aerosol mass deposits.</P>

The determined geometric mean aerodynamic diameter of the test aerosol must be within 0.15 µm of the aerodynamic diameter calculated from the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator. The geometric standard deviation of the primary particles must not exceed 1.1.</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine the population of multiplets in the collected sample. The multiplet population of the particle test atmosphere must not exceed 10 percent of the total particle population.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This test applies to a candidate sampler which differs from the reference method sampler only with respect to the design of the inlet. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the aspiration of a Class II candidate sampler is such that it representatively extracts an ambient aerosol at elevated wind speeds. This wind tunnel test uses a single-sized, liquid aerosol in conjunction with wind speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr. The test atmosphere concentration is alternately measured with the candidate sampler and a reference method device, both of which are operated without the 2.5-micron fractionation device installed. The test conditions are summarized in table F-2 of this subpart (under the heading of “wind tunnel inlet aspiration test”).

              <SUBJECT>Test procedure: Static fractionator test.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This test applies only to those candidate methods in which the sole deviation from the reference method is in the design of the 2.5-micron fractionation device. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the fractionation characteristics of the candidate fractionator are acceptably similar to that of the reference method sampler. It is recognized that various methodologies exist for quantifying fractionator effectiveness. The following commonly-employed techniques are provided for purposes of guidance. Other methodologies for determining sampler effectiveness may be used contingent upon prior approval by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Wash-off method.</E> Effectiveness is determined by measuring the aerosol mass deposited on the candidate sampler's after filter versus the aerosol mass deposited in the fractionator. The material deposited in the fractionator is recovered by washing its internal surfaces. For these wash-off tests, a fluorometer must be used to quantitate the aerosol concentration. Note that if this technique is chosen, the candidate must be reloaded with coarse aerosol prior to each test point when reevaluating the curve as specified in the loading test.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Static chamber method.</E> Effectiveness is determined by measuring the aerosol mass concentration sampled by the candidate sampler's after filter versus that which exists in a static chamber. A calibrated fluorometer shall be used to quantify the collected aerosol deposits. The aerosol concentration is calculated as the measured aerosol mass divided by the sampled air volume.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Divided flow method.</E> Effectiveness is determined by comparing the aerosol concentration upstream of the candidate sampler's fractionator versus <PRTPAGE P="101"/>that concentration which exists downstream of the candidate fractionator. These tests may utilize either fluorometry or a real-time aerosol measuring device to determine the aerosol concentration.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical definition.</E> Effectiveness under static conditions is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a given size reaching the sampler filter to the mass concentration of particles of the same size existing in the test atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Facilities and equipment required</E>—(1) <E T="03">Aerosol generation.</E> Methods for generating aerosols shall be identical to those prescribed in § 53.62(c)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Particle delivery system.</E> Acceptable apparatus for delivering the generated aerosols to the candidate fractionator is dependent on the effectiveness measurement methodology and shall be defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Wash-off test apparatus.</E> The aerosol may be delivered to the candidate fractionator through direct piping (with or without an in-line mixing chamber). Validation particle size and quality shall be conducted at a point directly upstream of the fractionator.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Static chamber test apparatus.</E> The aerosol shall be introduced into a chamber and sufficiently mixed such that the aerosol concentration within the chamber is spatially uniform. The chamber must be of sufficient size to house at least four total filter samplers in addition to the inlet of the candidate method size fractionator. Validation of particle size and quality shall be conducted on representative aerosol samples extracted from the chamber.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Divided flow test apparatus.</E> The apparatus shall allow the aerosol concentration to be measured upstream and downstream of the fractionator. The aerosol shall be delivered to a manifold with two symmetrical branching legs. One of the legs, referred to as the bypass leg, shall allow the challenge aerosol to pass unfractionated to the detector. The other leg shall accommodate the fractionation device.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Particle concentration measurement</E>—(i) <E T="03">Fluorometry.</E> Refer to § 53.62(c)(7).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Number concentration measurement.</E> A number counting particle sizer may be used in conjunction with the divided flow test apparatus in lieu of fluorometric measurement. This device must have a minimum range of 1 to 10 µm, a resolution of 0.1 µm, and an accuracy of 0.15 µm such that primary particles may be distinguished from multiplets for all test aerosols. The measurement of number concentration shall be accomplished by integrating the primary particle peak.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Setup</E>—(1) <E T="03">Remove the inlet and downtube from the candidate fractionator.</E> All tests procedures shall be conducted with the inlet and downtube removed from the candidate sampler.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Surface treatment of the fractionator.</E> Rinsing aluminum surfaces with alkaline solutions has been found to adversely affect subsequent fluorometric quantitation of aerosol mass deposits. If wash-off tests are to be used for quantifying aerosol penetration, internal surfaces of the fractionator must first be plated with electroless nickel. Specifications for this plating are specified in Society of Automotive Engineers Aerospace Material Specification (SAE AMS) 2404C, Electroless Nickel Plating (Reference 3 in appendix A of subpart F).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Test procedure: Wash-off method</E>—(1) <E T="03">Clean the candidate sampler.</E> Note: The procedures in this step may be omitted if this test is being used to evaluate the fractionator after being loaded as specified in § 53.65.</P>
              <P>(i) Clean and dry the internal surfaces of the candidate sampler.</P>
              <P>(ii) Prepare the internal fractionator surfaces in strict accordance with the operating instructions specified in the sampler's operating manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedure: Loading test.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> (1) The loading tests are designed to quantify any appreciable changes in a candidate method sampler's performance as a function of coarse aerosol collection. The candidate sampler is exposed to a mass of coarse aerosol equivalent to sampling a mass concentration of 150 µg/m<SU>3</SU> over the time period that the manufacturer has specified between periodic cleaning. After loading, the candidate sampler is then evaluated by performing the test in § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), § 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), or § 53.64 (static fractionator test). If the acceptance criteria are met for this evaluation test, then the candidate sampler is approved for multi-day sampling with the periodic maintenance schedule as specified by the candidate method. For example, if the candidate sampler passes the reevaluation tests following loading with an aerosol mass equivalent to sampling a 150 µg/m<SU>3</SU> aerosol continuously for 7 days, then the sampler is approved for 7 day field operation before cleaning is required.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical definition.</E> Effectiveness after loading is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a given size reaching the sampler filter to the mass concentration of particles of the same size approaching the sampler.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Facilities and equipment required</E>—(1) <E T="03">Particle delivery system.</E> The particle delivery system shall consist of a static chamber or a low velocity wind tunnel having a sufficiently large cross-sectional area such that the test sampler, or portion thereof, may be installed in the test section. At a minimum, the system must have a sufficiently large cross section to house the candidate sampler inlet as well as a collocated isokinetic nozzle for measuring total aerosol concentration. The mean velocity in the test section of the static chamber or wind tunnel shall not exceed 2 km/hr.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Aerosol generation equipment.</E> For purposes of these tests, the test aerosol shall be produced from commercially available, bulk Arizona road dust. To provide direct interlaboratory comparability of sampler loading characteristics, the bulk dust is specified as 0-10 µm ATD available from Powder Technology Incorporated (Burnsville, MN). A fluidized bed aerosol generator, <PRTPAGE P="107"/>Wright dust feeder, or sonic nozzle shall be used to efficiently deagglomerate the bulk test dust and transform it into an aerosol cloud. Other dust generators may be used contingent upon prior approval by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Isokinetic sampler.</E> Mean aerosol concentration within the static chamber or wind tunnel shall be established using a single isokinetic sampler containing a preweighed high-efficiency total filter.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Analytic balance.</E> An analytical balance shall be used to determine the weight of the total filter in the isokinetic sampler. The precision and accuracy of this device shall be such that the relative measurement error is less than 5.0 percent for the difference between the initial and final weight of the total filter. The identical analytic balance shall be used to perform both initial and final weighing of the total filter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedure: Volatility test.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This test is designed to ensure that the candidate method's losses due to volatility when sampling <PRTPAGE P="108"/>semi-volatile ambient aerosol will be comparable to that of a federal reference method sampler. This is accomplished by challenging the candidate sampler with a polydisperse, semi-volatile liquid aerosol in three distinct phases. During phase A of this test, the aerosol is elevated to a steady-state, test-specified mass concentration and the sample filters are conditioned and preweighed. In phase B, the challenge aerosol is simultaneously sampled by the candidate method sampler and a reference method sampler onto the preweighed filters for a specified time period. In phase C (the blow-off phase), aerosol and aerosol-vapor free air is sampled by the samplers for an additional time period to partially volatilize the aerosol on the filters. The candidate sampler passes the volatility test if the acceptance criteria presented in table F-1 of this subpart are met or exceeded.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical definitions.</E> (1) Residual mass (RM) is defined as the weight of the filter after the blow-off phase subtracted from the initial weight of the filter.</P>
              <P>(2) Corrected residual mass (CRM) is defined as the residual mass of the filter from the candidate sampler multiplied by the ratio of the reference method flow rate to the candidate method flow rate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Facilities and equipment required</E>—(1) <E T="03">Environmental chamber.</E> Because the nature of a volatile aerosol is greatly dependent upon environmental conditions, all phases of this test shall be conducted at a temperature of 22.0 ±0.5 °C and a relative humidity of 40 ±3 percent. For this reason, it is strongly advised that all weighing and experimental apparatus be housed in an environmental chamber capable of this level of control.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Aerosol generator.</E> The aerosol generator shall be a pressure nebulizer operated at 20 to 30 psig (140 to 207 kPa) to produce a polydisperse, semi-voltile aerosol with a mass median diameter larger than 1 µm and smaller than 2.5 µm. The nebulized liquid shall be A.C.S. reagent grade glycerol (C<E T="52">3</E>H<E T="52">8</E>O, FW = 92.09, CAS 56-81-5) of 99.5 percent minimum purity. For the purpose of this test the accepted mass median diameter is predicated on the stable aerosol inside the internal chamber and not on the aerosol emerging from the nebulizer nozzle. Aerosol monitoring and its stability are described in (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Aerosol monitoring equipment.</E> The evaporation and condensation dynamics of a volatile aerosol is greatly dependent upon the vapor pressure of the volatile component in the carrier gas. The size of an aerosol becomes fixed only when an equilibrium is established between the aerosol and the surrounding vapor; therefore, aerosol size measurement shall be used as a surrogate measure of this equilibrium. A suitable instrument with a range of 0.3 to 10 µm, an accuracy of 0.5 µm, and a resolution of 0.2 µm (e.g., an optical particle sizer, or a time-of-flight instrument) shall be used for this purpose. The parameter monitored for stability shall be the mass median instrument measured diameter (i.e. optical diameter if an optical particle counter is used). A stable aerosol shall be defined as an aerosol with a mass median diameter that has changed less than 0.25 µm over a 4 hour time period.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Internal chamber.</E> The time required to achieve a stable aerosol depends upon the time during which the aerosol is resident with the surrounding air. This is a function of the internal volume of the aerosol transport system and may be facilitated by recirculating the challenge aerosol. A chamber with a volume of 0.5 m<SU>3</SU> and a recirculating loop (airflow of approximately 500 cfm) is recommended for this purpose. In addition, a baffle is recommended to dissipate the jet of air that the recirculating loop can create. Furthermore, a HEPA filtered hole in the wall of the chamber is suggested to allow makeup air to enter the chamber or excess air to exit the chamber to maintain a system flow balance. The concentration inside the chamber shall be maintained at 1 mg/m<SU>3</SU> ±20 percent to obtain consistent and significant filter loading.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Aerosol sampling manifold.</E> A manifold shall be used to extract the aerosol from the area in which it is equilibrated and transport it to the candidate method sampler, the reference <PRTPAGE P="109"/>method sampler, and the aerosol monitor. The losses in each leg of the manifold shall be equivalent such that the three devices will be exposed to an identical aerosol.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Chamber air temperature recorders.</E> Minimum range 15-25 °C, certified accuracy to within 0.2 °C, resolution of 0.1 °C. Measurement shall be made at the intake to the sampling manifold and adjacent to the weighing location.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Chamber air relative humidity recorders.</E> Minimum range 30 - 50 percent, certified accuracy to within 1 percent, resolution of 0.5 percent. Measurement shall be made at the intake to the sampling manifold and adjacent to the weighing location.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Clean air generation system.</E> A source of aerosol and aerosol-vapor free air is required for phase C of this test. This clean air shall be produced by filtering air through an absolute (HEPA) filter.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Balance.</E> Minimum range 0 - 200 mg, certified accuracy to within 10 µg, resolution of 1 µg.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional filter handling conditions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Filter handling.</E> Careful handling of the filter during sampling, conditioning, and weighing is necessary to avoid errors due to damaged filters or loss of collected particles from the filters. All filters must be weighed immediately after phase A dynamic conditioning and phase C.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Dynamic conditioning of filters.</E> Total dynamic conditioning is required prior to the initial weight determined in phase A. Dynamic conditioning refers to pulling clean air from the clean air generation system through the filters. Total dynamic conditioning can be established by sequential filter weighing every 30 minutes following repetitive dynamic conditioning. The filters are considered sufficiently conditioned if the sequential weights are repeatable to ±3 µg.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Static charge.</E> The following procedure is suggested for minimizing charge effects. Place six or more Polonium static control devices (PSCD) inside the microbalance weighing chamber, (MWC). Two of them must be placed horizontally on the floor of the MWC and the remainder placed vertically on the back wall of the MWC. Taping two PSCD's together or using double-sided tape will help to keep them from falling. Place the filter that is to be weighed on the horizontal PSCDs facing aerosol coated surface up. Close the MWC and wait 1 minute. Open the MWC and place the filter on the balance dish. Wait 1 minute. If the charges have been neutralized the weight will stabilize within 30-60 seconds. Repeat the procedure of neutralizing charges and weighing as prescribed above several times (typically 2-4 times) until consecutive weights will differ by no more than 3 micrograms. Record the last measured weight and use this value for all subsequent calculations.</P>

            <P>Section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (“the Act”), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to establish requirements to control air pollution from outer continental shelf (“OCS”) sources in order to attain and maintain Federal and State ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. This part establishes the air pollution control requirements for OCS sources and the procedures for implementation and enforcement of the requirements, consistent with these stated objectives of section 328(a)(1) of the Act. In implementing, enforcing and revising this rule and in delegating authority hereunder, the Administrator <PRTPAGE P="116"/>will ensure that there is a rational relationship to the attainment and maintenance of Federal and State ambient air quality standards and the requirements of part C of title I, and that the rule is not used for the purpose of preventing exploration and development of the OCS.</P>

If there is no delegated agency in the COA for sources located within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, or in the NOA for sources located beyond 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, the EPA will issue the permit and implement and enforce the requirements of this part. For sources located within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, the Administrator may retain the authority for implementing and enforcing the requirements of this part if the NOA and COA are in different States.</P>

            <P>(a) The Administrator will update this part as necessary to maintain consistency with the regulations of onshore areas in order to attain and maintain Federal and State ambient standards and comply with part C of title I of the Act.</P>
            <P>(b) Where an OCS activity is occurring within 25 miles of a State seaward boundary, consistency reviews will occur at least annually. In addition, in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, consistency reviews will occur upon receipt of an NOI and when a State or local agency submits a rule to EPA to be considered for incorporation by reference in this part 55.</P>
            <P>(1) Upon initiation of a consistency review, the Administrator will evaluate the requirements of part 55 to determine whether they are consistent with the current onshore requirements.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Administrator finds that part 55 is inconsistent with the requirements in effect in the onshore area, EPA will conduct a notice and comment rulemaking to update part 55 accordingly.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consistency reviews triggered by receipt of an NOI.</E> Upon receipt of an NOI, the Administrator will initiate a consistency review of regulations in the onshore area.</P>

            <P>(1) If the NOI is submitted by a source for which the COA has previously been assigned, EPA will publish a proposed consistency update in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> no later than 60 days after the receipt of the NOI, if an update is deemed necessary by the Administrator:</P>

            <P>(2) If the NOI is submitted by a source requiring a COA designation, EPA will publish a proposed consistency update in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> if an update is deemed necessary by the Administrator:</P>
            <P>(i) No later than 75 days after receipt of the NOI if no adjacent areas submit a request for COA designation and the NOA becomes the COA by default, or</P>
            <P>(ii) No later than 105 days after receipt of the NOI if an adjacent area submits a request to be designated as COA but fails to submit the required demonstration within 90 days of receipt of the NOI, or</P>
            <P>(iii) No later than 15 days after the date of the final COA determination if one or more demonstrations are received.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Consistency reviews triggered by State and local air pollution control agencies submitting rules directly to EPA for inclusion into part 55.</E> (1) EPA will propose in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to approve applicable rules submitted by State or local regulatory agencies for incorporation by reference into § 55.14 of this part by the end of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the submittal is received by EPA.</P>
            <P>(2) State and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 must be rationally related to the attainment and maintenance of Federal or State ambient air quality standards or to the requirements of part C of title I of the Act. The submittal must be legible and unmarked, with the adoption date and the name of the agency on each page, and must be accompanied by proof of adoption.</P>
            <P>(e) No rule or regulation that EPA finds to be arbitrary or capricious will be incorporated into this part.</P>
            <P>(f) A source may not submit a complete permit application until any update the Administrator deems necessary to make part 55 consistent with the COA's rules has been proposed.</P>

              <P>(a) A primary copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, or other nonferrous smelter is eligible for an NSO if it meets the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The smelter was in existence and operating on August 7, 1977;</P>

              <P>(2) The smelter is subject to an approved or promulgated sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>) State Implementation Plan (SIP) emission limitation which is adequate to ensure that National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO<E T="52">2</E> are achieved without the use of any unauthorized dispersion techniques; and</P>

              <P>(3) The Administrator determines, based on a showing by the smelter owner, that no means of emission limitation applicable to the smelter which would enable it to comply with its SIP stack emission limitation for SO<E T="52">2</E> has been adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available (taking into account the cost of compliance, nonair quality health and environmental impact, and energy considerations) in accordance with § 57.201(d)(1).</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of these regulations:</P>
              <P>(1) The following means of emission limitation shall be considered adequately demonstrated for nonferrous smelters. (Taking into account nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy considerations, but not the cost of compliance).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Retrofit control technologies.</E> (A) Sulfuric acid plant in conjunction with an adequately demonstrated replacement technology or process modification;</P>
              <P>(B) Magnesium oxide (concentration) scrubbing;</P>

              </P>
              <P>(G) Continuous smelting (Mitsubishi) process; and</P>
              <P>(H) Strong stream/weak stream gas blending.</P>

              <P>(2) Each adequately demonstrated means of emission limitation which would enable a smelter to comply with its SIP emission limitation for SO<E T="52">2</E> shall be considered applicable to the smelter unless the smelter operator demonstrates that the use of a particular system at that smelter is technically unreasonable, for reasons specific to that site.</P>

              <P>(3) An applicable means of emission limitation which would enable a smelter to comply with its SIP emission limitation for SO<E T="52">2</E> shall be considered adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available to the smelter (taking into account the cost of compliance) if the information submitted under §§ 57.107(a) and 57.203(b) (plus any necessary supplemental information) shows, according to the criteria, procedures, and tests contained in appendix A to this part and in accordance with § 57.201(d)(1), that both of the following two tests are met.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">The rate of return test.</E> The present value of the smelter's future net cash flow (during and after investment in constant control technology) is more than book value of the smelter's net investment in constant dollars.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">The profit protection test.</E> The constant control technology expenditure reduces the present value of the smelter's forecast pretax profits by less than 50%.</P>
              <P>(c) When applying for an NSO, a smelter must establish, for purposes of applying the financial eligibility tests, which adequately demonstrated constant control technology applicable to that smelter is the most economically feasible for use at that smelter.</P>

              <P>Any eligible smelter may apply for an NSO to the appropriate EPA Regional Office or to the appropriate State or local air pollution control agency.</P>
              <P>(a) When application is made to EPA, all parts of the application required to be submitted under this subpart shall be sent directly to the Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Confidential Information Unit. In addition, the smelter owner shall send a copy of the application, except that part required to be submitted under § 57.203(b) (eligibility), directly to the appropriate EPA Regional Office.</P>
              <P>(b) When application is made to the appropriate State or local agency, the smelter owner shall submit one complete copy of all parts of the application required to be submitted under this subpart to that agency, in addition to the application requirements contained in paragraph (a) of this section. If the smelter owner is requesting an advance eligibility determination pursuant to § 57.203(b), such request must be made in writing and shall accompany the copy of the application being sent to the Director of the Stationary Source Compliance Division of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
              <P>(c) If the smelter owner is requesting a waiver of the interim constant control requirement of § 57.301, such request must be sent directly to the Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division, at the time of application, in accordance with § 57.802.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">The NSO Process.</E> (1) A smelter desiring an NSO shall apply for an NSO by submitting an application under subpart B including the financial information required in appendix A and including the information necessary to make the determinations required by this subparagraph and § 57.201(d)(2). The issuing agency shall analyze the financial information according to the financial eligibility test prescribed by subpart A and described in appendix A. The issuing Agency shall then determine whether the smelter is able to comply with its SIP on or before the date required in the SIP by installing adequately demonstrated technology which is reasonably available. See also § 57.102(a)(3). If the test demonstrates that adequately demonstrated technology is not reasonably available to the smelter to allow it to comply with the SIP by the required compliance date, the smelter is eligible for an NSO.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) If the smelter is determined to be eligible for an NSO under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the issuing Agency shall apply the appendix A financial eligibility tests again before issuing an NSO in order to determine if the smelter can comply with its SIP requirements on or before January 1, 1988 by installing adequately demonstrated <PRTPAGE P="176"/>technology which is reasonably available.</P>

              <P>(ii) If application of the tests shows that the smelter could comply by or before January 1, 1988, the issuing agency shall notify the smelter of this determination, and shall not issue an NSO to the smelter unless the NSO contains a SIP compliance schedule meeting the requirements of § 57.705. Such a compliance schedule must provide for compliance with the smelter's SO<E T="52">2</E> SIP as expeditiously as practicable and in no case later than January 1, 1988. A smelter must submit to the issuing agency information necessary to determine a compliance schedule meeting the requirements of § 57.705. This information shall be submitted by a smelter within thirty days after the smelter is notified by the issuing agency that a SIP compliance schedule is required. The Administrator may consider an NSO application to be withdrawn for SIP enforcement purposes if a smelter fails to submit such information within the time required under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(iii) If no adequately demonstrated technology is found to be reasonably available to enable a smelter to comply by January 1, 1988, it would be excused from the compliance schedule requirement in § 57.201(d)(2)(ii), but it would be subject to reevaluation of its ability to comply by that date at any time during the term of the NSO. (See § 57.201(d)(3)).</P>
              <P>(3) At any time during the term of an NSO which does not contain a SIP compliance schedule, EPA or the issuing agency may reevaluate the availability of technology to the smelter. If EPA or the issuing agency determines that adequately demonstrated technology is reasonably available to permit the smelter to comply with its SIP by or before January 1, 1988, the NSO shall be amended within 3 months time after such determination. The amendment shall require compliance with all SIP requirements by or before January 1, 1988, and shall include a compliance schedule meeting the requirements of § 57.705. The determination that adequately demonstrated technology is reasonably available shall be made by reapplying the same appendix A financial eligibility tests required by subpart B, updated by economic data reflecting current operating conditions and currently demonstrated control technology. Any such determination and amendment shall be governed by the provisions of this part and section 119 of the Clean Air Act.</P>
              <P>(4) Notice and opportunity for public hearing in accordance with section 119 of the Clean Air Act must be provided before issuance of any NSO.</P>
              <P>(e) A smelter that does not have any constant SO<E T="52">2</E> controls or whose existing constant SO<E T="52">2</E> controls when in full operation and optimally maintained are not sufficient to treat all strong SO<E T="52">2</E> streams may apply for a waiver of the requirements of subpart C to install interim constant controls by submitting an application under subpart H. A waiver may be granted only with respect to the requirement to eliminate bypass of constant controls through the installation of new constant control equipment, not with respect to the requirements for optimum maintenance and operation of existing equipment. EPA shall then determine the smelter's ability to afford installation of the required additional interim constant SO<E T="52">2</E> control equipment at the smelter based on financial eligibility information analyzed according to the financial test prescribed in appendix A. A waiver of the requirement for additional interim constant controls will be granted if EPA determines in accordance with the procedures of subpart H that imposition of this requirement would necessitate closure of the smelter for at least one year.</P>

The letter of intent shall contain a statement of the owner's intent to apply for an NSO, and an agreement to provide any information required under this part. The letter of intent shall be signed by a corporate official authorized to make such commitments. Upon receipt of any letter of intent by the issuing agency, the SIP emission limitation for sulfur dioxide, as to that applicant, shall be <PRTPAGE P="177"/>deemed suspended for 60 days. The 60 day suspension may be extended for good cause at the discretion of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Complete application.</E> (1) Within the period referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the smelter owner shall submit its completed application pursuant to § 57.201. Receipt of all parts of a substantially complete application postmarked within the original or extended application period shall be deemed to continue the suspension of the SIP emission limitation for SO<E T="52">2</E> until the issuing agency issues or declines to issue an NSO. This suspension shall in all cases terminate, however, 90 days after receipt of the substantially completed application, unless extended for good cause at the discretion of the Administrator. If, in the Administrator's judgment, good faith effort has been made to submit a complete application, additional time may be granted to allow for correction of minor deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(2) If an issuing agency transmits an NSO to EPA for approval before the expiration of the suspension of the Federal SIP emission limitation, the suspension shall continue until EPA approves or disapproves the NSO.</P>

              <P>Each NSO shall require an interim level of sulfur dioxide constant controls to be operated at the smelter, unless a waiver of this requirement has been granted to the owner under subpart H of this part. Except as otherwise provided in § 57.304, the interim constant controls shall be properly operated and maintained at all times. The NSO shall require the following gas streams to be treated by interim constant controls:</P>
              <P>(a) In copper smelters, off-gases from fluidized bed roasters, flash furnaces, NORANDA reactors, electric furnaces and copper converters;</P>
              <P>(b) In lead smelters, off-gases from the front end of the sintering machine and any other sinter gases which are recirculated;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Performance level of interim constant controls.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Maximum feasible efficiency.</E> Each NSO shall require: that the smelter operate its interim constant control systems at their maximum feasible efficiency, including the making of any improvements necessary to correct the effects of any serious deficiencies; that the process and control equipment be maintained in the way best designed to ensure such operation; and that process operations be scheduled and coordinated to facilitate treatment of process gas streams to the maximum possible extent. Maximum feasible efficiency shall be expressed in the NSO in the form of a limitation on the concentration of SO<E T="52">2</E> in the tail gas of each individual control system in combination <PRTPAGE P="180"/>with an appropriate averaging period, as provided below in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The limitation level for SO</E>
                <E T="52">2</E>
                <E T="03">concentration in the control system tail gas.</E> The level at which the concentration limitation is set shall take into account fluctuations in the strength and volume of process off-gases to the extent that those fluctuations affect the SO<E T="52">2</E> content of the tail gas and cannot be avoided by improved scheduling and coordination of process operations. The limitation shall exclude the effect of any increase in emissions caused by process or control equipment malfunction. The limitation shall take into account unavoidable catalyst deterioration in sulfuric acid plants, but may prescribe the frequency of catalyst screening or replacement. The NSO shall also prohibit the smelter owner from using dilution air to meet the limitation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Averaging period.</E> (1) The averaging period shall be derived in combination with the concentration limitation and shall take into account the same factors described in paragraph (b). The averaging period established under this paragraph should generally not exceed the following:</P>
              <P>(i) For sulfuric acid plants on copper smelters, 12-hour running average;</P>
              <P>(ii) For sulfuric acid plants on lead smelters, 6-hour running average;</P>
              <P>(iii) For sulfuric acid plants on zinc smelters, 2-hour running average;</P>
              <P>(iv) For dimethylaniline (DMA) scrubbing units on copper smelters, 2-hour running average.</P>
              <P>(2) A different averaging period may be established if the applicant demonstrates that such a period is necessary in order to account for the factors described in paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, that the period is enforceable and satisfies the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Improved performance.</E> (1) The performance level representing maximum feasible efficiency for any existing control system (e.g., a sulfuric acid plant or a DMA scrubber) shall require the correction of the effects of any serious deficiencies in the system. For the purpose of this paragraph, at least the following problems shall constitute serious deficiencies in acid plants:</P>
              <P>(i) Heat exchangers and associated equipment inadequate to sustain efficient, autothermal operation at the average gas strengths and volumes received by the acid plant during routine process equipment operation;</P>
              <P>(ii) Failure to completely fill all available catalyst bed stages with sufficient catalyst;</P>
              <P>(iii) Inability of the gas pre-treatment system to prevent unduly frequent plugging or fouling (deterioration) of catalyst or other components of the acid plant; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Blower capacity inadequate to permit the treatment of the full volume of gas which the plant could otherwise accommodate, or in-leakage of air into the flues leading to the plant, to the extent that this inadequacy results in bypassing of gas around the plant.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of § 57.304(c) (malfunction demonstration), no excess emissions (as defined in § 57.304(a)) shall be considered to have resulted from a malfunction in the constant control system if the smelter owner has not upgraded serious deficiencies in the constant control system in compliance with the requirements of § 57.302(d)(1), unless the smelter owner demonstrates under § 57.304(c) that compliance with those requirements would not have affected the magnitude of the emission.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Multiple control devices.</E> (1) At any smelter where off-gas streams are treated by various existing control systems (e.g., multiple acid plants or a DMA scrubber and an acid plant), the NSO shall require the use of those systems in the combination that will result in the maximum feasible net SO<E T="52">2</E> removal.</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent that compliance with this requirement is demonstrated by the smelter operator to result in excess emissions during unavoidable start up and shut down of the control systems, those excess emissions shall not constitute violations of the NSO.</P>

Emission of any gas stream identified under § 57.301 (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this subpart that is not treated by a sulfur dioxide constant control system shall also constitute an excess emission under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The excess emission report.</E> Each NSO shall require the smelter to report all excess emissions to the issuing agency, as provided in § 57.305(b). The report shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Identity of the stack or other emission points where the excess emissions occurred;</P>
              <P>(2) Magnitude of the excess emissions expressed in the units of each applicable emission limitation, as well as the operating data, documents, and calculations used in determining the magnitude of the excess emissions;</P>

              <P>(1) The air pollution control systems, process equipment, or processes were at all times maintained and operated, to the maximum extent practicable, in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions;</P>
              <P>(2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as practicable, including the use of off-shift labor and overtime;</P>
              <P>(3) The amount and duration of the excess emissions were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and</P>
              <P>(4) The excess emissions were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of serious deficiencies in, or inadequate operation, design, or maintenance of, the process or control equipment.</P>

              <P>(e) An NSO may provide that excess emissions which occur during acid plant start-up as the result of the cooling of acid plant catalyst due to the unavailability of process gas to an acid plant during a prolonged SCS curtailment or scheduled maintenance are not excess emissions. If the NSO does so provide, it shall also require the use of techniques or practices designed to minimize these excess emissions, such as the sealing of the acid plant during prolonged curtailments, the use of auxiliary heat or SO<E T="52">2</E> injected during the curtailment, or the preheating of the acid plant before start-up of the process equipment it serves.</P>
              <P>(f) Requirements for a smelter with constant controls that applies for a waiver.</P>
              <P>(1) If a smelter that has some interim constant controls applies for a waiver in accordance with subpart H, the following requirements shall apply pending action on the waiver application and following final action granting or approving a waiver:</P>
              <P>(i) The NSO shall require the smelter to implement maintenance and operation measures designed to reduce to the maximum extent feasible the potential for bypass of existing interim constant controls.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon application for a waiver under subpart H, the smelter shall submit to the issuing agency for its approval and to EPA proposed maintenance and operation measures for compliance with the requirements of paragraph (i).</P>
              <P>(iii) The remainder of this subpart shall apply except that: (A) The emission limitations required under this subpart shall be based only on existing constant control equipment as upgraded through the improved maintenance and operation required by this paragraph, and (B) bypass of existing controls shall not constitute excess emissions, provided the maintenance and operation requirements and emission limitations prescribed by the NSO are satisfied.</P>
              <P>(2) After any denial of a waiver by the issuing Agency, or any disapproval by EPA of a waiver granted by the issuing agency, the NSO shall be amended consistent with the requirements of this subpart and § 57.702.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Monitoring.</E> (1) Each NSO shall require compliance with the control system performance requirements established pursuant to this subpart to be determined through the use of continuous monitors for measuring SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration.</P>

              <P>(i) Such monitors must be installed, operated and maintained in accordance with the performance specifications and other requirements contained in appendix D to 40 CFR part 52 or part 60. The monitors must take and record at least one measurement of SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration from the effluent of each control system in each 15-minute period. Failure of the monitors to record at least 95% of the 15-minute periods in any 30-day period shall constitute a violation of the NSO.</P>
              <P>(ii) The sampling point shall be located at least 8 stack diameters (diameter measured at sampling point) downstream and 2 diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, constriction, or flame, unless another location is approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(iii) The sampling point for monitoring emissions shall be in the duct at the centroid of the cross section if the cross sectional area is less than 4.645m<SU>2</SU> (50 ft<SU>2</SU>) or at a point no closer to the wall than 0.914m (3 ft) if the cross sectional area is 4.645m<SU>2</SU> (50 ft<SU>2</SU>) or more. The monitor sample point shall be in an area of small spatial concentration gradient and shall be representative of the concentration in the duct.</P>

              <P>(iv) The measurement system(s) installed and used pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the manufacturer's recommended zero adjustment and calibration procedures at least once per 24-hour operating period unless the manufacturer specifies or recommends calibration at shorter intervals, in which case such specifications <PRTPAGE P="183"/>or recommendations shall be followed. Records of these procedures shall be made which clearly show instrument readings before and after zero adjustment and calibration.</P>

              <P>(2) Each NSO shall require the monitoring of any ducts or flues used to bypass gases, required under this subpart to be treated by constant controls, around the smelter's sulfur dioxide constant control system(s) for ultimate discharge to the atmosphere. Such monitoring shall be adequate to disclose the time of the bypass, its duration, and the approximate volume and SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration of gas bypassed.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> (1) Each NSO shall require that the smelter maintain a record of all measurements required under paragraph (a) of this section. Results shall be summarized monthly and shall be submitted to the issuing agency within 15 days after the end of each month. The smelter owner shall retain a record of such measurements for one year after the NSO period terminates.</P>
              <P>(2) Each NSO shall require that the smelter maintain a record of all measurements and calculations required under § 57.303(b). Results shall be summarized on a monthly basis and shall be submitted to the issuing agency at 6-month intervals. The smelter owner shall retain a record of such measurements and calculations for at least one year after the NSO terminates.</P>
              <P>(3) The report required under § 57.304(b) shall accompany the report required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>

Such plans must follow current EPA guidelines for quality assurance, in order to be approvable.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Continuous data.</E> Manual source testing methods equivalent to 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used to determine compliance if the continuous monitoring system malfunctions.</P>

              <P>(1) The monitors shall be located at all points of expected SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations necessary to anticipate and prevent possible violations of NAAQS anywhere in the smelter's DLA. The determination of the locations where such concentrations may occur shall take into account all recorded or probable meteorological and operating conditions (including bypassing of control equipment), as well as the presence of other sources of SO<E T="52">2</E> significantly affecting SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations in the DLA.</P>

              <P>(2) The number and location of sites shall be based on dispersion modeling, measured ambient air quality data, meteorological information, and the results of the continuing review required by paragraph (f) of this section.

              <P>(1) In the case of any NSO applicant that would have a DLA which would overlap with the DLA of any other smelter that has applied for an NSO or has an NSO in effect, the NSO applicant shall include in its application an enforceable joint plan, agreed to by such other smelter(s). In determining whether a joint plan is required, the NSO applicant shall calculate its DLA according to the table in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The DLA of the other smelter shall be calculated according to the table in paragraph (c)(1) unless the other smelter has an NSO in effect, in which case the boundaries in that NSO shall be used. The enforceable joint plan shall provide for:</P>
              <P>(i) Emission curtailment adequate to ensure that the NAAQS will not be violated in any areas of overlapping DLAs; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Conclusive prospective allocation of legal liability in the event that the NAAQS are violated in the area of overlapping DLAs.</P>

              <FP>Such plans may, but need not, include the operation of a joint SCS system. Each NSO shall require adherence by the NSO applicant owner to the joint plan for emission curtailment and allocation of liability, unless the issuing <PRTPAGE P="185"/>agency determines, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that the NSO applicant's DLA does not overlap with that of any other smelter.</FP>
              <P>(2) In the case of any NSO applicant that would have a DLA which would overlap with the DLA of any other smelter whose owner has not applied for an NSO (and does not have an NSO in effect), the NSO applicant's submittal shall contain a written consent, signed by a corporate official empowered to do so. The consent shall state that if, at any time thereafter, the owner of the other smelter applies for an NSO, and the other smelter's DLA would overlap with the NSO applicant's DLA, the NSO applicant will negotiate and submit an enforceable joint plan for emission curtailment and allocation of liability (as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section). In determining whether it is necessary to submit such a consent, each smelter's DLA shall be calculated according to the table set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The consent shall state that a joint plan shall be submitted within 90 days of the issuing agency's notification to the NSO applicant of receipt of the other smelter's letter of intent, unless the issuing agency determines that the DLAs do not overlap. Failure of the NSO applicant to submit such a plan shall constitute grounds for denial of its NSO application or a violation of an effective NSO, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">The SCS operational manual.</E> Each NSO shall require the smelter to be operated in accordance with the provisions of an SCS operational manual approved by the issuing agency. The SCS operational manual shall describe the circumstances under which, the extent to which, and the procedures through which emissions shall be curtailed to prevent violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA. Failure to curtail emissions when and as much as indicated by the manual or to follow the provisions of the manual implementing the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section shall constitute a violation of the NSO.</P>
              <P>(1) The operational manual shall prescribe emission curtailment decisions based on the use of real time information from the air quality monitoring network dispersion model estimates of the effect of emissions on air quality, and meteorological observations and predictions.</P>
              <P>(2) The operational manual shall also provide for emission curtailment to prevent violation of the NAAQS within the smelter's DLA which may be caused in part by stack emissions, and to the extent practicable fugitive emissions, from any other source (unless that other source is a smelter subject to an NSO).</P>
              <P>(3) The SCS operational manual shall include (but not be limited to):</P>
              <P>(i) A clear delineation of the authority of the SCS operator to require all other smelter personnel to implement the operator's curtailment decisions;</P>
              <P>(ii) The maintenance and calibration procedures and schedules for all SCS equipment;</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of the procedures to be followed for the regular acquisition of all meteorological information necessary to operate the system;</P>
              <P>(iv) The ambient concentrations and meteorological conditions that will be used as criteria for determining the need for various degrees of emission curtailment;</P>
              <P>(v) The meteorological variables as to which judgments may be made in applying the criteria stated pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section;</P>
              <P>(vi) The procedures through which and the maximum time period within which a curtailment decision will be made and implemented by the SCS operator;</P>
              <P>(vii) The method for immediately evaluating the adequacy of a particular curtailment decision, including the factors to be considered in that evaluation;</P>
              <P>(viii) The procedures through which and the time within which additional necessary curtailment will immediately be effected; and</P>
              <P>(ix) The procedures to be followed to protect the NAAQS in the event of a mechanical failure in any element of the SCS.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Continuing review and improvement of the SCS.</E> Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to conduct an active <PRTPAGE P="186"/>program to continuously review the design and operation of the SCS to determine what measures may be available for improving the performance of the system. Among the elements of this program shall be measures to locate and examine possible places both inside and outside the DLA where unmonitored NAAQS violations may be occurring. Such measures shall include the use of modeling as appropriate and mobile ambient air quality monitors, following up on information and complaints from members of the public, and other appropriate activities. The NSO shall also require the submission of a semi-annual report to the issuing agency detailing the results of this review and specifying measures implemented to prevent the recurrence of any violations of NAAQS.</P>

              <P>(b) Any NSO issued to a smelter not required to immediately comply with the requirements of subpart G under § 57.701 shall contain a schedule for compliance with those requirements as expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than 6 months from the effective date of the NSO, except as follows: Where a waiver is requested in accordance with subpart H, an NSO may be issued without a schedule for compliance with the requirements for which a waiver is being considered consistent with subpart H, pending a final decision on the request under subpart H. If a waiver is requested in accordance with subpart H, compliance with the requirements of subpart C which were deferred as a result of such request shall be achieved as expeditiously as practicable after, but in no case later than 6 months from a final decision by the issuing agency to deny a waiver under subpart H or disapproval by EPA of a waiver granted by the issuing agency. The time limits specified herein may be extended only if a smelter operator demonstrates that special circumstances warrant more time, in which case the compliance schedule shall require compliance as expeditiously as practicable. An NSO which does not contain a schedule for compliance with all the requirements of subpart C because a waiver has been requested in accordance with subpart H shall be amended in accordance with § 57.104 within three months after a final decision under subpart H so as to either grant a waiver of any remaining requirements of subpart C, or deny such a waiver and place the smelter on a compliance schedule for meeting those requirements. If the issuing agency grants a waiver and such waiver is disapproved by EPA, the issuing agency shall promptly amend the NSO so as to place the smelter on a compliance schedule meeting any remaining requirements of subpart C.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 57.802</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Request for waiver.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Each smelter owner requesting a waiver shall complete, sign, and submit appendix A (Test for Eligibility for Interim Waiver). Copies of appendix A may be obtained from any EPA Regional Administrator, or from the Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. Claims of confidentiality shall be made as provided in § 57.203.</P>
              <P>(2) The smelter owner shall append to the completed and signed appendix A full copies of all documents, test results, studies, reports, scientific literature and assessments required by appendix A. To the extent that the material consists of generally available published material, the smelter owner may cite to the material in lieu of appending it to appendix A. The smelter owner shall specifically designate those portions of any documents relied upon and the facts or conclusions in appendix A to which they relate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of submitting incomplete application.</E> (1) The Administrator, or a person designated by him to review applications for waivers, may advise the smelter owner in writing whenever he determines that additional information is needed in order to make the waiver <PRTPAGE P="194"/>eligibility determinations required by section 119(d)(2) of the Act. The smelter owner shall promptly supply such information. All additional information requested under this paragraph and filed in the manner required by paragraph (d) shall be deemed part of appendix A.</P>
              <P>(2) Failure to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section shall be grounds for denial of the requested waiver.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Time for requesting waivers.</E> Any request for a waiver must be submitted to the Administrator by the smelter owner at the time of the application for an NSO from the State or the Administrator, as the case may be. Where a smelter was issued a second period NSO by a State before these regulations went into effect, a request for a waiver shall be made and a completed appendix A shall be submitted, within sixty days of the effective date of these regulations, unless an extension is granted by the Administrator, or his designee, for good cause.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of request.</E> A copy of appendix A (plus attachments) which has been completed for the purpose of requesting a waiver of constant control requirements shall be filed with the Administrator, addressed as follows: Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, Attn: Confidential Information Unit.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> A smelter shall be eligible for consideration under this subpart only if it establishes that (1) its existing strong stream controls, if any, lack the capacity while in full operation to treat all strong stream sulfur dioxide emissions and (2) bypass of strong stream controls due to excess strong stream sulfur dioxide emissions cannot be avoided with improved operation and maintenance of existing strong stream controls and process equipment.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Criteria for decision.</E> The Administrator shall grant or approve a waiver, whichever is appropriate, for any eligible smelter as to which he finds, in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in appendix A, that:</P>
              <P>(1) The higher of the two net present values of future cash flows completed under the two alternative sets of assumptions set forth in the instructions to schedule D.6 in appendix A in less than liquidation (salvage) value; or</P>
              <P>(2) The smelter's average variable costs at all relevant levels of production (after installation of interim constant control equipment) would exceed the weighted average price of smelter output for one year or more.</P>

              <P>(i) A “Staff Computational Analysis,” using the financial information submitted by the smelter owner under § 57.802 to evaluate the economic circumstances of the smelter for which the waiver is sought;</P>
              <P>(ii) A tentative determination as to whether an interim requirement for the use of constant controls would be so costly as to necessitate permanent or prolonged temporary cessation of operations at the smelter for which the waiver is requested. The tentative determination shall contain a “Proposed Report and Findings” summarizing the conclusions reached in the Staff Computational Analysis, discussing the estimated cost of interim controls, and assessing the effect upon the smelter of requiring those controls. The tentative determination shall also contain a proposed recommendation that the waiver be granted or denied, based upon the Proposed Report and Findings, and stating any additional considerations supporting the proposed recommendation. This tentative determination shall be a public document.</P>

              <P>(2) In preparing the Proposed Report and Findings, the EPA staff shall attempt to the maximum extent feasible to avoid revealing confidential information which, if revealed, might damage the legitimate business interests of the applicant. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, the tentative determination shall be accompanied by a listing of all materials considered by EPA staff in developing the tentative determination. Subject to the provisions of § 57.814(a), full copies of all such materials shall be included in the <PRTPAGE P="195"/>administrative record under § 57.814, except that, to the extent the material consists of published material which is generally available, full citations to that material may be given instead.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Composition of hearing panel.</E> The Presiding Officer shall preside at the hearing held under this subpart. An EPA panel shall also take part in the hearing. In general, the membership of the panel shall consist of EPA employees having special expertise in areas related to the issues to be addressed at the hearing, including economists and engineers. For this reason, the membership of the panel may change as different issues are presented for discussion.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional hearing participants.</E> Either before or during the hearing, the Presiding Officer, after consultation with the panel, may request that a person not then scheduled to participate in the hearing (including an EPA employee or a person identified by any scheduled hearing participant as having knowledge concerning the issues raised for discussion at the hearing) make a presentation or make himself available for cross-examination at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Questioning of hearing participants.</E> The panel members may question any person participating in the hearing. Cross-examination by persons other than panel members shall not be permitted at this stage of the proceeding except where the Presiding Officer determines, after consultation with the panel, that circumstances compel such cross-examination. However, persons in the hearing audience, including other hearing participants, may submit written questions to the Presiding Officer for the Presiding Officer to ask the participants, and the Presiding Officer may, after consultation with the panel, and in his sole discretion, ask these questions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of additional material.</E> Participants in the hearing shall submit for the hearing record such additional material as the hearing panel may request within 10 days following the close of the hearing, or such other period of time as is ordered by the Presiding Officer.

              <SUBJECT>Opportunity for cross-examination.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for cross-examination.</E> After the close of the panel hearing conducted under this part, any participant in that hearing may submit a written request for cross-examination. The request shall be received by EPA within one week after a full transcript of the hearing becomes available and shall specify:</P>
              <P>(1) The disputed issue(s) of material fact as to which cross-examination is requested. This shall include an explanation of why the questions at issue are factual, rather than of an analytical or policy nature; the extent to which they are in dispute in the light of the record made thus far, and the extent to which and why they can reasonably be considered material to the decision on the application for a waiver; and</P>
              <P>(2) The person(s) the participant desires to cross-examine, and an estimate of the time necessary. This shall include a statement as to why the cross-examination requested can be expected to result in full and true disclosure resolving the issue of material fact involved.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Order granting or denying request for cross-examination.</E> As expeditiously as practicable after receipt of all requests for cross-examination under paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer, after consultation with the hearing panel, shall issue an order either granting or denying each such request, which shall be disseminated to all persons requesting cross-examination and all persons to be cross-examined. If any request for cross-examination is granted, the order shall specify:</P>
              <P>(1) The issues as to which cross-examination is granted;</P>
              <P>(2) The persons to be cross-examined on each issue;</P>
              <P>(3) The persons allowed to conduct cross-examination;</P>
              <P>(4) Time limits for the examination of witnesses; and</P>
              <P>(5) The date, time and place of the supplementary hearing at which cross-examination shall take place. In issuing this ruling, the Presiding Officer may determine that one or more participants have the same or similar interests and that to prevent unduly repetitious cross-examination, they should be required to choose a single representative for purposes of cross-examination. In such a case, the order shall simply assign time for cross-examination by that single representative without identifying the representative further.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Supplementary hearing.</E> The Presiding Officer and at least one member of the original hearing panel shall preside at the supplementary hearing. During the course of the hearing, the Presiding Officer shall have authority to modify any order issued under paragraph (b) of this section. A verbatim transcript shall be made of this hearing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternatives to cross-examination.</E> (1) No later than the time set for requesting cross-examination, a hearing participant may request that alternative methods of clarifying the record (such as the submittal of additional written information) be used in lieu of or in addition to cross-examination. The Presiding Officer shall issue an order granting or denying such request at the time he issues (or would have issued) an order under paragraph (b) of this section. If the request is granted, the order shall specify the alternative provided and any other relevant information (e.g., the due date for submitting written information).</P>
              <P>(2) In passing on any request for cross-examination submitted under paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer may, as a precondition to ruling on the merits of such request, require that alternative means of clarifying the record be used whether or not a request to do so has been made under the preceding paragraph. The person requesting cross-examination shall have one week to comment on the results of utilizing such alternative means, following which the Presiding Officer, as soon as practicable, shall issue an order granting or denying such person's request for cross-examination.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. General Instructions</HD>
              <P>1.1 Purpose of the application. This application provides financial reporting schedules and the accompanying instructions for EPA's determination of eligibility for a nonferrous smelter order (NSO), and for a waiver of the interim constant controls requirement of an NSO. Although the determination of eligibility for an NSO is prerequisite for the determination of a waiver, appendix A, as a matter of convenience to applicants, includes both the NSO and waiver tests and reporting schedules.</P>
              <P>In order to support an NSO eligibility determination, the applicant must submit operating and financial data as specified by the schedules included in this application. Specific instructions for completing each schedule are provided in subsequent sections of the instructions. In general, applicants must provide:</P>
              <P>(a) Annual income statements, balance sheets and supporting data covering the five most recent fiscal years for the smelter for which the NSO requested.</P>
              <P>(b) Forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, net income from operations and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations subject to this application, on the basis of anticipated smelter operations without any sulfur dioxide air pollution control facilities that have not been installed as of the NSO application date.</P>
              <P>(c) Forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, net income from operations and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations subject to this application, on the basis of anticipated smelter operations with expected additional sulfur dioxide control facilities required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation.</P>

              <P>(d) For smelters applying for a waiver of interim constant controls, forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations prepared on the basis of two alternative assumptions: (1) Installation of additional pollution control facilities required to <PRTPAGE P="203"/>comply with interim constant control requirements, no installation of any additional SO<E T="52">2</E> controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and closure of the smelter after January 1, 1988; and (2) installation of additional pollution control facilities required to comply with interim constant control requirements, installation of any additional SO<E T="52">2</E> controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, and continued operation of the smelter after January 1, 1988.</P>
              <P>1.2 NSO financial tests. EPA will use separate tests to determine eligibility for an NSO and to evaluate applications for a waiver of the interim constant control requirement. The two tests for NSO eligibility employ a present value approach for determining the reasonable availability of constant control technology that will enable an applicant to achieve full compliance with its SIP sulfur dioxide emission limitation. The tests for the waiver of the interim constant control requirements employ variable costing and discounted cash flow standards for evaluating an applicant's economic capability to implement those requirements.</P>
              <P>1.2.1 <E T="03">NSO Eligibility Tests.</E> Each applicant must establish that the system of production and/or constant control technology that will enable the smelter to achieve full compliance with its SIP SO<E T="52">2</E> emission limitation standard is not reasonably available. An applicant will determine financial eligibility for an NSO by passing at least one of the following two tests.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Profit Protection Test.</E> The smelter will experience a reduction in pre-tax profits of 50 percent or more after undertaking the required installation of constant controls.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate of Return Test.</E> The smelter will earn a rate of return on historical net investment, expressed in constant dollars, below the industry average cost of capital after undertaking the required installation of constant controls.</P>
              <P>1.2.2 <E T="03">Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls.</E> Applicants that do not have an existing constant control system or whose constant controls are not sufficient when in operation and optimally maintained to treat all strong streams in accordance with subpart C, may apply for a waiver of the requirements of subpart C with respect to any interim constant controls not already installed. Applicants will be eligible for a temporary waiver of the requirement for interim constant controls not already installed, if they can establish pursuant to the procedures in this application that the imposition of such control requirements would economically necessitate closure of the smelter facility for a period of one year or longer. The economic justification for a non-permanent closure under this temporary waiver test is defined as a situation in which the smelter's projected operating revenues for one or more years during which the NSO is in effect are inadequate to cover variable operating costs anticipated after installing the required interim control technology. Temporary waivers will be granted for only the period of time over which applicants can establish an inability by the firm to cover its variable operating costs. Interim control waiver requests based on the smelter's projected inability to earn adequate income after installation of interim pollution control equipment will be subject to the permanent waiver test.</P>
              <P>1.2.3 Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls. Applicants that do not have an existing constant control system or whose constant controls are not sufficient when in operation and optimally maintained to treat all strong streams in accordance with subpart C, may apply for a waiver of the requirements of subpart C with respect to any interim constant controls not already installed. Applicants will be eligible for a permanent waiver of the requirement for interim constant controls not already installed, if they can establish pursuant to the procedures in this application that an imposition of such control requirements would necessitate permanent closure of the smelter. Economic justification for a permanent closure is defined as a situation in which the present value of future cash flows anticipated from the smelter after installing the required interim control technology is less than the smelter's current salvage value under an orderly plan of liquidation. Future cash flows are determined under two alternative assumptions. The higher present value of cash flows computed under these assumptions is then compared to salvage value.</P>
              <P>1.2.4 EPA Contact for NSO Inquiries. Inquiries concerning this portion of the requirements for NSO application should be addressed to Laxmi M. Kesari, Environmental Protection Agency, EN 341, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</P>
              <P>1.2.5 Certification. The NSO Certification Statement must be signed by an authorized officer of the applicant firm.</P>

              <P>1.3 Confidentiality. Applicants may request that information contained in this application be treated as confidential. Agency regulations concerning claims of confidentiality of business information are contained in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B (41 FR 36902 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> September 1, 1976, as amended by 43 FR 39997 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> September 8, 1978). The regulations provide that a business may, if it desires, assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information furnished to EPA. The claim must be made at the same time the applicable information is submitted. The manner of asserting such claims is specified in 40 CFR 2.203(b). Information <PRTPAGE P="204"/>covered by such a claim will be handled by the Agency in accordance with procedures set forth in the subpart B regulations. EPA will not disclose information on a business that has made a claim of confidentiality, except to the extent of and in accordance with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. However, if no claim of confidentiality is made when information is furnished to EPA, the information may be made available to the public without notice to the business.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. NSO Financial Reporting Overview</HD>
              <P>2.1 Revenue and Cost Assignment. The amounts assigned to operations of the smelter subject to this NSO application should include (1) revenues and costs directly attributable to the smelter's operating activities and (2) indirect operating costs shared with other segments of the firm to the extent that a specific causal and beneficial relationship can be identified for the allocation of such costs to the smelter. Do not allocate revenues and costs associated with central administrative activities for which specific causal and beneficial relationships to the activities of the smelter cannot be established. Nonallocable items include, but are not restricted to, amounts such as dividend and interest income on centrally administered portfolio investments, central corporate administrative office expenses and, except for schedules supporting the Profit Protection Test, interest on long-term debt financing arrangements. Provide a detailed explanation of amounts classified as nontraceable on a separate schedule and attach as part of Exhibit B.</P>
              <P>2.2 Transfer Prices on Affiliated Part Transactions. Certain transactions by the smelter subject to an NSO application may reflect sales to or purchases from “affiliated” customers or suppliers with whom the smelter has a common bond of ownership and/or managerial control. In preparing this application, affiliated party transactions shall be defined as transactions with any entity that the firm, or its owners, controls directly or indirectly either through an ownership of 10 percent or more of the entity's voting interests or through an exercise of managerial responsibility. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B supporting schedules explaining the pricing policies established on affiliated party transactions incorporated in the financial reporting schedules.</P>
              <P>Prices on inter-segment material and product transfers within a firm, or on external purchases from and sales to other affiliated suppliers and customers, may differ from the prices on comparable transactions with unaffiliated suppliers and customers. In this event, applicants also must present in the Exhibit B supporting schedules and incorporate in the NSO financial reporting schedules appropriate adjustments for restating affiliated party transactions. Affiliated party transactions must be restated at either (a) equivalent prices on comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties if such price quotations can be obtained or (b) prices that provide the selling entity with a normal profit margin above its cost of sales if a meaningful comparison with unaffiliated transaction prices cannot be established.</P>

              <P>A “normal” profit margin is defined as the gross operating profit per dollar of operating revenue that will provide an average after-tax rate of return on permanent capital (total assets less current liabilities). This average rate of return is defined differently for the historical and forecast periods. The applicant must use a rate of return of 8.0 percent for the <E T="03">historical</E> period. This figure is based on a historical average earned rate of return for the nonferrous metals industry. <SU>1</SU>

                <FTREF/> EPA may update this figure periodically. The updates will be available in the rulemaking docket or from the INFORMATION CONTACT noted in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> For the <E T="03">forecast</E> period, the applicant must use a rate of return equal to the current weighted average cost of capital for the nonferrous metals industry, as computed in Section 2.6.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> The derivation of this figure is explained in two memoranda to EPA (Item Nos. II-A-1 and IV-A-6a in EPA Docket No. A-82-35).</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>Forecast smelting charges for integrated smelters can be computed from forecast market smelting charges. Integrated copper smelters may use as the basis of their forecast revenues the forecast copper smelting charges provided by EPA, adjusted as described in Section 2.4.1. An applicant may submit other forecasts, providing the forecast methodology is in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 and fully documented as part of Exhibit B.</P>
              <P>2.3 Forecasting Requirements. NSO applicants must provide the Agency with financial forecasts in Schedules B.1 through B.6 and C.1 through C.2. Applicants requesting either a temporary or permanent waiver from interim constant control requirements also must provide an additional set of financial forecasts in Schedules D.1 through D.4.</P>
              <P>2.3.1 Forecast Period. The forecast period must include at least two full years following completion and startup of the required pollution control system. The forecast period shall be from 1984 through 1990 for an NSO application filed in 1984. If an application is filed in a later year, the 1984 through 1990 period should be adjusted accordingly. All references in this appendix to the period 1984 through 1990 should be interpreted accordingly.</P>

              <P>2.3.2 Forecast Adjustment by Control Case. Some line items that have the same title in <PRTPAGE P="205"/>several schedules may contain different information because they are based on different assumptions regarding pollution controls. Production interruptions or curtailments due to the installation of pollution control facilities may require adjustments to certain revenue and cost estimates in the respective control cases. For example, production curtailments associated with supplementary control systems may be the basis for the pre-control case, yet are eliminated when constant controls replace supplementary control systems in the constant controls case. The application of pollution control techniques that involve process changes in the smelter's operations (e.g., conversion to flash smelting) also may require specific forecasts by applications of associated impacts on incremental operating revenues and costs.</P>
              <P>2.3.3 Nominal Dollar Basis. Applicants must make their financial forecasts in terms of nominal dollars. Forecasts of selected parameters provided by EPA will furnish guidelines to an applicant in preparing the required cost and revenue estimates. In particular, copper smelting charges provided in nominal-dollar terms must be used directly by the applicant as given; i.e., the stipulated charge estimates should not be inflated.</P>
              <P>2.3.4 Tolling Service Equivalent Basis. Applicants must express all revenue forecasts on a tolling service equivalent basis. Thus, forecast revenues are computed as the product of the forecast quantity of processed concentrate, the forecast average product grade of the concentrate (the percent of metal in the concentrate), and the forecast smelting charge. Smelters that are not tolling smelters and that do not use the copper smelting charges provided by EPA (as described in Section 2.4.1) can forecast a smelting charge from forecast product grade of the concentrate, percent recovery, and product and concentrate prices. The forecast prices and derivation of the smelting charge must be in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5, and the methodology must be fully documented in Exhibit B.</P>
              <P>2.4 EPA Furnished Forecast Data. In making projection for the period 1984 through 1990, applicants must, except as noted below, use the indices provided by EPA. The table below presents yearly values for each index (expressed as annual percentage rates of change) to be used by smelters applying for an NSO before January 1, 1985. If forecasts are needed for 1991 and EPA has not provided new forecasts, applicants should use the Data Resources, Inc. forecasts for 1991 (Docket Item No. IV-A-6c) and the average of CRU's forecasts for 1989 and 1990 (expressed in 1991 dollars).</P>

                <TNOTE> </TNOTE>
              </GPOTABLE>
              <P>2.4.1 Copper smelting charge. EPA will supply a forecast of reference copper smelting charges. These charges, which are f.o.b. U.S. mine, are based on an estimate of export smelting charges and on the differential value of copper in the U.S. and the world market. They must be used in forecasting unaffiliated party revenues for the period following the expiration of existing contracts and in forecasting affiliated party revenues for the entire forecast period. The applicant may submit its own smelting charge forecast for the post-contract period, provided that such forecast is in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 and fully documented and substantiated as part of Exhibit B.</P>
              <P>The EPA forecast export charge represents the world market copper smelting charge with copper valued at the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper price. This charge serves as the reference charge for the applicant copper smelter in calculating its smelting charges. Applicant copper smelters must derive their smelting charges from this world market charge as described in paragraph (a) below.</P>
              <P>The applicant may adjust the derived smelter-specific smelting charge to account for other factors, provided the adjustments are fully documented as part of Exhibit B. An example of such a factor is the unit deduction for metallurgical losses in smelting. Adjustment for this factor is discussed in paragraph (b) below.</P>

              <P>(a) The derivation of a smelter-specific smelting charge from the world market charge is based on assumptions regarding transportation costs and the U.S. producer-world copper price differential. The EPA <PRTPAGE P="206"/>forecast export charge is the forecast smelting charge available at a Japanese smelter, with copper valued at the London Metal Exchange copper price. The charge includes no freight costs, which must be paid by the mine. A U.S. smelter determines its smelting charge to a mine by meeting the combined world market smelting charge, adjusted to reflect copper valued at the U.S. producer price, and the transportation charge from the mine to the Japanese smelter. This combined price is the highest that a mine is willing to pay for smelting.</P>
              <P>The smelter's net smelting charge is equal to the combined world smelting charge, adjusted to the U.S. producer price for copper (i.e., the export forecast charge plus the U.S. producer price premium), and the transportation cost between the mine and a Far East smelter, minus the cost of transporting the concentrate between the mine and the applicant smelter.</P>
              <P>The applicant smelter's net smelting charge for concentrate from an individual mine is computed by first adding the U.S. producer Price-LME world price differential to the EPA-supplied forecast. The cost of transporting copper from the U.S. mine to the Far East is then added to this figure. The net smelting charge is obtained by subtracting from this total the cost of transporting copper from the mine to the applicant smelter. In making these calculations, an applicant must supply (and fully document in Exhibit B), the freight cost between the mine and the Far East and between the mine and the smelter. This freight cost must be converted to nominal dollars of the respective forecast years by applying the GNP percentage price change forecasts supplied by EPA or smelter-provided forecasts of transportation price changes. The smelter-provided forecasts of transportation price changes must comply with guidelines regarding such forecasts in Section 2.5.</P>

              <P>An applicant must use a 3 cent per pound U.S. producer price premium (relative to the LME price) in calculating the smelter's net smelting charge. The applicant may substitute its own forecasts of the U.S. producer price premium if it can substantiate such forecasts in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 regarding applicant-provided smelting charge forecasts of principal products. All supporting documentation for such applicant-supplied forecasts must be supplied in Exhibit B. Any updates of the producer price premium will be available in the rulemaking docket or from the INFORMATION CONTACT noted in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>The following two representative examples illustrate this methodology for making the transportation and U. S. producer price premium adjustment.</P>
              <P>(1) The applicant smelter, located in Arizona, obtains concentrate from an adjacent mine. The freight charge from mine to smelter is zero. The mine is willing to pay the applicant smelter an amount no higher than the sum of the world market smelting charge (adjusted for the copper value differential) and the transportation cost of shipping copper from the mine to the Far East. This combined cost is the net charge received by the applicant smelter. If the export smelting charge is 12 cents per pound and the freight cost between the mine and the Far East is 13 cents per pound, the applicant smelter would calculate a net smelting charge equal to 28 cents: 12 cents plus 3 cents (for the U.S. producer price premium) plus 13 cents (for the freight cost between the mine and the Far East).</P>
              <P>(2) The applicant smelter obtains concentrate from a nonadjacent mine. The mine will pay a charge no higher than the total market smelting charge, valued at the U.S. producer price, and the transportation costs between the mine and a Far East smelter. The applicant's net smelting charge is equal to this combined cost minus the transportation costs for shipping the concentrate between mine and applicant smelter.</P>
              <P>Suppose that the mine to Far East freight charge is 13 cents per pound and the mine to applicant smelter freight charge is 4 cents per pound. If the export smelting charge is 12 cents per pound, the net smelting charge is equal to 24 cents per pound: 12 cents plus 3 cents (for the U.S. producer price premium) plus 13 cents (for the freight cost to the Far East) minus 4 cents (for the freight cost to the applicant smelter).</P>
              <P>(b) The EPA forecast charges are based on a one unit deduction for metallurgical losses. This means that if a concentrate grades 25 percent copper, the mine is only credited with 24 percent for metal return. The one unit deduction on 25 percent concentrate is equivalent to a 96 percent payment for contained copper. Should a smelter recover less than 96 percent, its revenue would be less than the EPA forecast smelting charge. Should a smelter recover more than 96 percent, its revenue would be greater than the EPA forecast smelting charge.</P>

              <P>2.4.2 Indices (Annual Percentage Changes). These indices, which are expressed as annual percentage rate changes in price (wages, energy prices, and GNP price deflator) must be used only for estimating the rate of price increases for the forecast period following the expiration of the applicant's current contracts. The applicant may use alternative forecasts of annual percentage changes for the forecast period following the expiration of current contracts, if justification is provided. Any such alternative forecasts must be prepared by a widely-recognized forecasting authority with expertise comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA. <PRTPAGE P="207"/>In addition, the documentation of these forecasts must be comparable to that provided by EPA's forecaster.</P>
              <P>The wage indices are to be applied to wage paid to manufacturing labor. The energy price indices are to be applied to prices of the respective energy products. The GNP price deflators are to be applied to prices for non-metal, non-labor, and non-energy inputs.</P>
              <P>2.5 Applicant Generated Forecasts. Within the specified limitations, applicants may submit a method of forecasting smelting charges and by-product, co-product and other prices. The method selected must be explained and unit prices or costs provided where applicable. The forecast elements must be compatible with an applicant's historical cost and revenue elements to permit direct comparisons of historical and forecast data. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B appropriate schedules explaining variances between forecast and historical unit costs for the smelter.</P>
              <P>Forecasts of the smelting charges of the smelter's principal product (i.e., copper, lead, zinc, etc.) may be prepared either by an independent forecasting authority or by the smelter's in-house personnel. If the forecasts are prepared by an independent forecasting authority, the following conditions must be satisfied: (1) The forecasting authority must have expertise comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA. (2) As much documentation of the forecasting methodology as can reasonably be obtained must be made available to EPA. Such documentation must, at a minimum, be comparable to the documentation supporting EPA smelting charge forecasts. <SU>2</SU>

              </FTNT>
              <P>If the smelting charge forecasts are prepared by in-house personnel, the following conditions must be met: (1) The in-house forecasts must be certified as being based on sound methodology by an independent forecasting authority with expertise comparable to that of the forecaster who prepared the EPA-supplied smelting charges. The independent forecasting authority shall also provide a brief explanation of the basis for the conclusion reached in the certification. (2) The smelter owner shall provide EPA with the documentation of the forecasting methodology employed, which must at a minimum be comparable to the extent of documentation supporting EPA's smelting charge forecasts. The smelter owner shall also make available upon request by EPA such additional documentation of the methodology and underlying data as EPA considers appropriate for evaluation of the forecasts.</P>
              <P>Forecasts of freight cost changes, which are applied to the freight costs used in calculating a smelter's net smelting charges, must be prepared by a widely-recognized forecasting authority. The forecaster's expertise must be comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA in forecasting the annual percentage changes in wages, energy prices, and GNP. The documentation of these forecasts must be comparable to that provided by EPA's forecaster.</P>
              <P>To the maximum extent practicable, by-product, co-product and (when applicable) unaffiliated smelting charges must be stated at market prices adjusted to f.o.b. smelter. Adjustments of these pricing bases must be made to reflect differences in grades and types of production. All adjustments must be consistent with expected sales, grades and types of concentrate processed. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B schedules describing and explaining the methods used to forecast these revenue items and the adjustments required for these revenue forecasts.</P>
              <P>Applicants must explain fully any changes from the historical data that are required to forecast labor productivity, ore-concentrate grade and composition, materials and energy consumption per unit of output, yield rates and other physical input/output relationships.</P>
              <P>Existing contractual terms must be used in forecasting those sales or input costs or prices to which the applicant is committed by contracts. The use of contract-dictated prices must be disclosed and supported by attaching as part of Exhibit B the terms and duration of labor and other supplier arrangements.</P>
              <P>Cost of compliance estimates need not be to the accuracy of final design/bid estimates; feasibility grade estimates will be acceptable. Updated cost of compliance estimates used in internal five year plans or specially prepared estimates of costs of compliance will generally be satisfactory.</P>
              <P>2.6 Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Nonferrous Metal Producers. The industry average cost of capital is a weighted average of the rates of return for equity and debt. Its components are the interest rate and the return on equity specific to the nonferrous metals industry.</P>
              <P>2.6.1 Computation. <SU>3</SU>
                <FTREF/> The applicant must compute the cost of capital according to the following formula:</P>

              <P>The horizon value, which is described in Section 2.7, is computed as of 1990, the end of the detailed forecast period. The discount factor to be applied to the horizon value is the same as for any other 1990 figure. For example, if the application is made in 1984, the value of N is 7.</P>
              <P>2.7 Horizon Value. The horizon value is the present value of a stream of cash flows or net income for 15 years beyond the last forecast year. Applicants must compute the horizon value by capitalizing the average forecast value of the last two forecast years using the current real weighted cost of capital. The line item instructions for schedules having a horizon value entry will specify the values to be capitalized.</P>

              <P>The applicant averages the values of the last two years after expressing both values in terms of the last year's dollars. The two-year average value is then multiplied by 9.6. This is the factor associated with capitalizing a 15 year value stream at the current <E T="03">real</E> weighted cost of capital of 6.2 percent.</P>
              <P>Applicants must use a separate schedule to calculate the horizon value for the Rate of Return Test and the Interim Controls Test (Schedule C.5 and D.7, respectively). These separate schedules adjust for potential overstatements in the horizon value cash flows that may be caused by control equipment depreciation reported for tax purposes.</P>
              <P>2.8 Data Entry</P>
              <P>2.8.1 Rounding. All amounts (including both dollar values and physical units) reported in the schedules and exhibits accompanying this application must be rounded to the nearest thousand and expressed in thousands of dollars or units unless otherwise indicated in the instructions.</P>
              <P>2.8.2 Estimates. Where an applicant's records cannot produce the specific data required by this application, the use of estimates will be allowed if a meaningful estimate can be made without significant distortion of the reported results. Data estimates must be supported by attaching on a separate sheet of paper as a part of Exhibit B an explanation identifying where such estimates are used and showing explicitly how the estimates were made.</P>
              <P>2.8.3 Missing Data. Applicants must provide, where applicable, all operating and financial data requested by this application. Only substantially complete applications can be accepted for processing by the Agency. Questions concerning data entries for which information is not provided by or cannot reasonably be estimated from the applicant's existing accounting records should be addressed to the EPA Contact for NSO Inquiries.</P>
              <P>2.8.4 Historical Period. The annual data requested in the historical schedules, Schedules A.1 through A.4, must be reported for each of the five fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which this application is filed. The historical period shall be from fiscal years 1979 through 1983 for an NSO application filed in 1984. If an application is filed in a later year, the references in this appendix to the period 1979 through 1983 should be interpreted accordingly.</P>
              <P>2.9 Use of schedules. All applicants must complete Schedules A.1 through A.4, which record historical revenues, cost, and capital investment data. These schedules will be used by EPA to assist in evaluating forecast data. Completion of the remaining schedules depends on the test required of the applicant.</P>
              <P>2.9.1 NSO Eligibility. An NSO applicant must pass one of the following two tests and complete the corresponding schedules.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Profit Protection Test.</E> The applicant must complete Schedules B.1 through B.7 to determine eligibility under the Profit Protection Test. Schedules B.1 and B.2 report the base case (without constant controls) revenue and cost forecast, respectively, and Schedule B.3 summarizes Schedules B.1 and B.2. Base case production forecasts should reflect any production curtailments associated with interim controls currently (preforecast) installed on smelters. Schedules B.4 and B.5 report the revenue and cost forecast, respectively, for the constant controls case, and Schedule B.6 summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the Profit Protection Test.</P>

              <P>Schedule B.7 presents the calculations for the Profit Protection Test. The applicant enters the forecast profits from Schedules B.3 and B.6. The present value of the forecast profits is then computed for each case. If the present value of forecast pre-tax profits with constant controls is less than 50 percent of the present value of forecast pre-tax profits <PRTPAGE P="209"/>without controls (base case) the smelter passes the test and is eligible for an NSO. The smelter also passes the test if the present value of forecast pre-tax profits without controls (base case) is negative.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate of Return Test.</E> The applicant must complete Schedules B.4, B.5, and C.1 through C.5 to determine eligibility under the Rate of Return Test. Schedules B.4 and B.5 report the revenue and cost forecast, respectively, for the constant controls case, and Schedule C.1 summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the Rate of Return Test. Schedule C.2 reports forecast sustaining capital investment for the constant controls case. Schedule C.3 reports historical net investment for the most recent fiscal year expressed in constant dollars, i.e., dollars of the year in which the application is made.</P>
              <P>Schedule C.4 presents the calculations for the Rate of Return Test. The applicant reports in Schedule C.4 the forecast cash flows from Schedules C.1 and C.2 and the horizon value from Schedule C.5, computes their present value, and subtracts the value of invested capital in constant dollars (taken from Schedule C.3) to yield net present value. If the net present value is less than zero, the smelter passes the test and is eligible to receive an NSO. This result indicates that the smelter is expected to earn a rate of return less than the industry average cost of capital.</P>
              <P>2.9.2 Interim Control Waivers. An applicant for a waiver from interim controls must complete either a portion or all of Schedules D.1 through D.7, depending on whether the application is for a temporary or permanent waiver.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls Test.</E> The applicant must complete Schedules D.1 through D.3 to establish eligibility for a temporary waiver from interim controls. Schedules D.1 and D.2 report forecast revenue and cost data under the assumption of installation of interim constant control equipment and no installation of any additional SO<E T="52">2</E> controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of the NSO. Schedule D.3 summarizes Schedules D.1 and D.2 and calculates gross operating profit. If gross operating profit is negative for any year during which the NSO is in effect, the applicant is eligible for a temporary waiver.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls Test.</E> The applicant must complete Schedules D.1 through D.7. All schedules except for Schedule D.5 must be completed twice, based on two alternative assumptions: (1) installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of any additional SO<E T="52">2</E> controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of the NSO, and closure of the smelter after January 1, 1988; and (2) installation of interim constant control equipment, installation of any additional SO<E T="52">2</E> controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, and continued operation of the smelter after January 1, 1988.</P>
              <P>Schedules D.1 and D.2 report forecast revenue and cost data under each assumption. Schedule D.3 summarizes Schedules D.1 and D.2, and Schedule D.4 reports forecast sustaining capital under each assumption. Schedule D.5 reports cash proceeds from liquidation.</P>
              <P>Schedule D.6 presents the calculations for the permanent waiver test. In Schedule D.6, the applicant reports cash flow projections from Schedules D.3 and D.4 and the horizon value from Schedule D.7, computes their present value and subtracts the current salvage value (taken from Schedule D.5) to yield net present value. The higher of the two net present value figures computed under the two alternative assumptions must be used in the test. If the higher net present value figure is negative, the applicant is eligible for a permanent waiver.</P>
              <P>2.10 Use of exhibits. In addition to data required by the schedules included in this application, the following information must be attached as exhibits.</P>
              <P>2.10.1 Exhibit A. Background information on the firm's organizational structure and its associated accounting and financial reporting systems for primary nonferrous activities. This information must include, where applicable, the firm's:</P>

The computation of the horizon value is different for this test than for the Profit Protection Test because this test requires the reporting of depreciation for tax purposes.</P>
              <P>In Schedule D.7, the applicant removes the tax savings of control equipment depreciation from the cash flows for the last two forecast years. A depreciation-free horizon value is then calculated from these depreciation-free cash flows. The tax savings of constant controls depreciation during the horizon years are then calculated separately. The final horizon value is equal to the sum of the depreciation-free horizon value and the tax savings from depreciation of constant controls accruing over the horizon years. The line items in Schedule D.7 are explained in the following instruction.</P>

The state, or where applicable local, agency must submit a copy of this 5-year assessment, along with a revised annual network plan, to the Regional Administrator. The assessments are due every five years beginning July 1, 2010.</P>
              <P>(e) All proposed additions and discontinuations of SLAMS monitors in annual monitoring network plans and periodic network assessments are subject to approval according to § 58.14.</P>

The final network design and all changes in design are subject to approval of the Regional Administrator. NCore and STN network design and changes are also subject to approval of the Administrator. Changes in SPM stations do not require approvals, but a change in the designation of a monitoring site from SLAMS to SPM requires approval of the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(d) State and local governments must follow the criteria contained in appendix E to this part for siting monitor inlets, paths or probes at SLAMS stations. Appendix E adherence is optional for SPM stations.</P>

              <P>(e) State and local governments must assess data from Class III PM <E T="52">2.5</E> FEM and ARM monitors operated within their network using the performance criteria described in table C-4 to subpart C of part 53 of this chapter, for cases where the data are identified as not of sufficient comparability to a collocated FRM, and the monitoring agency requests that the FEM or ARM data should not be used in comparison to the NAAQS. These assessments are required in the monitoring agency's annual monitoring network plan described in § 58.10(b) for cases where the FEM or ARM is identified as not of sufficient comparability to a collocated FRM. For these collocated PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitors the performance criteria apply with the following additional provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) The acceptable concentration range (Rj), µg/m<SU>3</SU> may include values down to 0 µg/m<SU>3</SU>.</P>
              <P>(2) The minimum number of test sites shall be at least one; however, the number of test sites will generally include all locations within an agency's network with collocated FRMs and FEMs or ARMs.</P>

              <P>(5) All seasons must be covered with no more than thirty-six consecutive months of data in total aggregated together.</P>

              <P>(6) The key statistical metric to include in an assessment is the bias (both additive and multiplicative) of the PM <E T="52">2.5</E> continuous FEM(s) compared to a collocated FRM(s). Correlation is required to be reported in the assessment, but failure to meet the correlation criteria, by itself, is not cause to exclude data from a continuous FEM monitor.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Operating schedules.</SUBJECT>
              <P>State and local governments shall collect ambient air quality data at any SLAMS station on the following operational schedules:</P>
              <P>(a) For continuous analyzers, consecutive hourly averages must be collected except during:</P>
              <P>(1) Periods of routine maintenance,</P>
              <P>(2) Periods of instrument calibration, or</P>
              <P>(3) Periods or monitoring seasons exempted by the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) For Pb manual methods, at least one 24-hour sample must be collected every 6 days except during periods or seasons exempted by the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) For PAMS VOC samplers, samples must be collected as specified in section 5 of appendix D to this part. Area-specific PAMS operating schedules must be included as part of the PAMS network description and must be approved by the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(d) For manual PM <E T="52">2.5</E> samplers:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Manual PM<E T="52">2.5</E> samplers at required SLAMS stations without a collocated continuously operating PM<E T="52">2.5</E> monitor must operate on at least a 1-<PRTPAGE P="254"/>in-3 day schedule unless a waiver for an alternative schedule has been approved per paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For SLAMS PM<E T="52">2.5</E> sites with both manual and continuous PM<E T="52">2.5</E> monitors operating, the monitoring agency may request approval for a reduction to 1-in-6 day PM<E T="52">2.5</E> sampling or for seasonal sampling from the EPA Regional Administrator. Other requests for a reduction to 1-in-6 day PM<E T="52">2.5</E> sampling or for seasonal sampling may be approved on a case-by-case basis. The EPA Regional Administrator may grant sampling frequency reductions after consideration of factors (including but not limited to the historical PM<E T="52">2.5</E> data quality assessments, the location of current PM<E T="52">2.5</E> design value sites, and their regulatory data needs) if the Regional Administrator determines that the reduction in sampling frequency will not compromise data needed for implementation of the NAAQS. Required SLAMS stations whose measurements determine the design value for their area and that are within ±10 percent of the annual NAAQS, and all required sites where one or more 24-hour values have exceeded the 24-hour NAAQS each year for a consecutive period of at least 3 years are required to maintain at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency until the design value no longer meets these criteria for 3 consecutive years. A continuously operating FEM or ARM PM<E T="52">2.5</E> monitor satisfies this requirement unless it is identified in the monitoring agency's annual monitoring network plan as not appropriate for comparison to the NAAQS and the EPA Regional Administrator has approved that the data from that monitor may be excluded from comparison to the NAAQS.</P>

              <P>(iii) Required SLAMS stations whose measurements determine the 24-hour design value for their area and whose data are within ±5 percent of the level of the 24-hour PM<E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS must have an FRM or FEM operate on a daily schedule if that area's design value for the annual NAAQS is less than the level of the annual PM<E T="52">2.5</E> standard. A continuously operating FEM or ARM PM<E T="52">2.5</E> monitor satisfies this requirement unless it is identified in the monitoring agency's annual monitoring network plan as not appropriate for comparison to the NAAQS and the EPA Regional Administrator has approved that the data from that monitor may be excluded from comparison to the NAAQS. The daily schedule must be maintained until the referenced design value no longer meets these criteria for 3 consecutive years.</P>
              <P>(iv) Changes in sampling frequency attributable to changes in design values shall be implemented no later than January 1 of the calendar year following the certification of such data as described in § 58.15.</P>
              <P>(2) Manual PM <E T="52">2.5</E> samplers at NCore stations and required regional background and regional transport sites must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency.</P>
              <P>(3) Manual PM<E T="52">2.5</E> speciation samplers at STN stations must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency unless a reduction in sampling frequency has been approved by the EPA Administrator based on factors such as area's design value, the role of the particular site in national health studies, the correlation of the site's species data with nearby sites, and presence of other leveraged measurements.</P>
              <P>(e) For PM <E T="52">10</E> samplers, a 24-hour sample must be taken from midnight to midnight (local standard time) to ensure national consistency. The minimum monitoring schedule for the site in the area of expected maximum concentration shall be based on the relative level of that monitoring site concentration with respect to the 24-hour standard as illustrated in Figure 1. If the operating agency demonstrates by monitoring data that during certain periods of the year conditions preclude violation of the PM <E T="52">10</E> 24-hour standard, the increased sampling frequency for those periods or seasons may be exempted by the Regional Administrator and permitted to revert back to once in six days. The minimum sampling schedule for all other sites in the area remains once every six days. No less frequently than as part of each 5-year network assessment, the most recent year of data must be considered to estimate the air quality status at the site near the area of maximum concentration. Statistical models such as analysis of concentration frequency distributions as described in “Guideline <PRTPAGE P="255"/>for the Interpretation of Ozone Air Quality Standards,” EPA-450/479-003, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, January 1979, should be used. Adjustments to the monitoring schedule must be made on the basis of the 5-year network assessment. The site having the highest concentration in the most current year must be given first consideration when selecting the site for the more frequent sampling schedule. Other factors such as major change in sources of PM <E T="52">10</E> emissions or in sampling site characteristics could influence the location of the expected maximum concentration site. Also, the use of the most recent 3 years of data might, in some cases, be justified in order to provide a more representative database from which to estimate current air quality status and to provide stability to the network. This multiyear consideration reduces the possibility of an anomalous year biasing a site selected for accelerated sampling. If the maximum concentration site based on the most current year is not selected for the more frequent operating schedule, documentation of the justification for selection of an alternative site must be submitted to the Regional Office for approval during the 5-year network assessment process. Minimum data completeness criteria, number of years of data and sampling frequency for judging attainment of the NAAQS are discussed in appendix K of part 50 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) The state, or where appropriate, local agency, shall report to the Administrator, via AQS all ambient air quality data and associated quality assurance data for SO<E T="52">2</E>; CO; O<E T="52">3</E>; NO<E T="52">2</E>; NO; NO<E T="52">y</E>; NO<E T="52">X</E>; Pb-TSP mass concentration; Pb-PM<E T="52">10</E> mass concentration; PM<E T="52">10</E> mass concentration; PM<E T="52">2.5</E> mass concentration; for filter-based PM<E T="52">2.5</E> FRM/FEM, the field blank mass; chemically speciated PM<E T="52">2.5</E> mass concentration data; PM<E T="52">10-2.5</E> mass concentration; meteorological data from NCore and PAMS sites; and metadata records and information specified by the AQS Data Coding Manual (<E T="03">https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/aqs_data_coding_manual_0.pdf</E>). Air quality data and information must be submitted directly to the AQS via electronic transmission on the specified schedule described in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The specific quarterly reporting periods are January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31. The data and information reported for each reporting period must contain all data and information gathered during the reporting period, and be received in the AQS within 90 days after the end of the quarterly reporting period. For example, the data for the reporting period January 1-March 31 are due on or before June 30 of that year.</P>
              <P>(c) Air quality data submitted for each reporting period must be edited, validated, and entered into the AQS (within the time limits specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section) pursuant to appropriate AQS procedures. The procedures for editing and validating data are described in the AQS Data Coding Manual and in each monitoring agency's quality assurance project plan.</P>

              <P>(d) The state shall report VOC and if collected, carbonyl, NH<E T="52">3</E>, and HNO<E T="52">3</E> data from PAMS sites, and chemically speciated PM<E T="52">2.5</E> mass concentration data to AQS within 6 months following the end of each quarterly reporting period listed in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) The State shall also submit any portion or all of the SLAMS and SPM data to the appropriate Regional Administrator upon request.</P>

              <P>(f) The state, or where applicable, local agency shall archive all PM <E T="52">2.5</E>, <PRTPAGE P="259"/>PM <E T="52">10</E>, and PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> filters from manual low-volume samplers (samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/minute) from all SLAMS sites for a minimum period of 5 years after collection. These filters shall be made available for supplemental analyses, including destructive analyses if necessary, at the request of EPA or to provide information to state and local agencies on particulate matter composition. Other Federal agencies may request access to filters for purposes of supporting air quality management or community health—such as biological assay—through the applicable EPA Regional Administrator. The filters shall be archived according to procedures approved by the Administrator, which shall include cold storage of filters after post-sampling laboratory analyses for at least 12 months following field sampling. The EPA recommends that particulate matter filters be archived for longer periods, especially for key sites in making NAAQS-related decisions or for supporting health-related air pollution studies.</P>

              <P>(g) Any State or, where applicable, local agency operating a continuous SO<E T="52">2</E> analyzer shall report the maximum 5-minute SO<E T="52">2</E> block average of the twelve 5-minute block averages in each hour, in addition to the hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> average.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Special purpose monitors (SPM).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An SPM is defined as any monitor included in an agency's monitoring network that the agency has designated as a special purpose monitor in its annual monitoring network plan and in AQS, and which the agency does not count when showing compliance with the minimum requirements of this subpart for the number and siting of monitors of various types. Any SPM operated by an air monitoring agency must be included in the periodic assessments and annual monitoring network plan required by § 58.10. The plan shall include a statement of purposes for each SPM monitor and evidence that operation of each monitor meets the requirements of appendix A or an approved alternative as provided by § 58.11(a)(2) where applicable. The monitoring agency may designate a monitor as an SPM after January 1, 2007 only if it is a new monitor, i.e., a SLAMS monitor that is not included in the currently applicable monitoring plan or, for a monitor included in the monitoring plan prior to January 1, 2007, if the Regional Administrator has approved the discontinuation of the monitor as a SLAMS site.</P>
              <P>(b) Any SPM data collected by an air monitoring agency using a Federal reference method (FRM), Federal equivalent method (FEM), or approved regional method (ARM) must meet the requirements of § 58.11, § 58.12, and appendix A to this part or an approved alternative to appendix A to this part. Compliance with appendix E to this part is optional but encouraged except when the monitoring agency's data objectives are inconsistent with those requirements. Data collected at an SPM using a FRM, FEM, or ARM meeting the requirements of appendix A must be submitted to AQS according to the requirements of § 58.16. Data collected by other SPMs may be submitted. The monitoring agency must also submit to AQS an indication of whether each SPM reporting data to AQS monitor meets the requirements of appendices A and E to this part.</P>
              <P>(c) All data from an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM which has operated for more than 24 months are eligible for comparison to the relevant NAAQS, subject to the conditions of §§ 58.11(e) and 58.30, unless the air monitoring agency demonstrates that the data came from a particular period during which the requirements of appendix A, appendix C, or appendix E to this part were not met, subject to review and EPA Regional Office approval as part of t, App. he annual monitoring network plan described in § 58.10.</P>

              <P>(d) If an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM is discontinued within 24 months of start-up, the Administrator will not <PRTPAGE P="260"/>base a NAAQS violation determination for the PM <E T="52">2.5</E> or ozone NAAQS solely on data from the SPM.</P>

              <P>(e) If an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM is discontinued within 24 months of start-up, the Administrator will not designate an area as nonattainment for the CO, SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">2</E>, or 24-hour PM <E T="52">10</E> NAAQS solely on the basis of data from the SPM. Such data are eligible for use in determinations of whether a nonattainment area has attained one of these NAAQS.</P>
              <P>(f) Prior approval from EPA is not required for discontinuance of an SPM.</P>

                <E T="03">data.</E> The primary and secondary annual and 24-hour PM <E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS are described in part 50 of this chapter. Monitors that follow the network technical requirements specified in § 58.11 are eligible for comparison to the NAAQS subject to the additional requirements of this section. PM <E T="52">2.5</E> measurement data from all eligible monitors are comparable to the 24-hour PM <E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS. PM <E T="52">2.5</E> measurement data from all eligible monitors that are representative of area-wide air quality are comparable to the annual PM <E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS. Consistent with appendix D to this part, section 4.7.1, when micro- or middle-scale PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitoring sites collectively identify a larger region of localized high ambient PM <E T="52">2.5</E> concentrations, such sites would be considered representative of an area-wide location and, therefore, eligible for comparison to the annual PM <E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS. PM <E T="52">2.5</E> measurement data from monitors that are not representative of area-wide air quality but rather of relatively unique micro-scale, or localized hot spot, or unique middle-scale impact sites are not eligible for comparison to the annual PM <E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS. PM <E T="52">2.5</E> measurement data from these monitors are eligible for comparison to the 24-hour PM <E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS. For example, if a micro- or middle-scale PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitoring site is adjacent to a unique dominating local PM <E T="52">2.5</E> source, then the PM <E T="52">2.5</E> measurement data from such a site would only be eligible for comparison to the 24-hour PM <E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS. Approval of sites that are suitable and sites that are not suitable for comparison with the annual PM <E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS is provided for as part of the annual monitoring network plan described in § 58.10.</P>

              <P>1.1 <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (a) This appendix specifies the minimum quality system requirements applicable to SLAMS and other monitor types whose data are intended to be used to determine compliance with the NAAQS (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> SPMs, tribal, CASTNET, NCore, industrial, etc.), unless the EPA Regional Administrator has reviewed and approved the monitor for exclusion from NAAQS use and these quality assurance requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) Primary quality assurance organizations are encouraged to develop and maintain quality systems more extensive than the required minimums. Additional guidance for the requirements reflected in this appendix can be found in the “Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems,” Volume II (see reference 10 of this appendix) and at a national level in references 1, 2, and 3 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>1.2 <E T="03">Primary Quality Assurance Organization (PQAO).</E> A PQAO is defined as a monitoring organization or a group of monitoring organizations or other organization that is responsible for a set of stations that monitors the same pollutant and for which data quality assessments will be pooled. Each criteria pollutant sampler/monitor must be associated with only one PQAO. In some cases, data quality is assessed at the PQAO level.</P>
              <P>1.2.1 Each PQAO shall be defined such that measurement uncertainty among all stations in the organization can be expected to be reasonably homogeneous as a result of common factors. Common factors that should be considered in defining PQAOs include:</P>
              <P>(a) Operation by a common team of field operators according to a common set of procedures;</P>
              <P>(b) Use of a common quality assurance project plan (QAPP) or standard operating procedures;</P>
              <P>(c) Common calibration facilities and standards;</P>
              <P>(d) Oversight by a common quality assurance organization; and</P>
              <P>(e) Support by a common management organization (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> state agency) or laboratory.</P>
              <P>Since data quality assessments are made and data certified at the PQAO level, the monitoring organization identified as the PQAO will be responsible for the oversight of the quality of data of all monitoring organizations within the PQAO.</P>
              <P>1.2.2 Monitoring organizations having difficulty describing its PQAO or in assigning specific monitors to primary quality assurance organizations should consult with the appropriate EPA Regional Office. Any consolidation of monitoring organizations to PQAOs shall be subject to final approval by the appropriate EPA Regional Office.</P>
              <P>1.2.3 Each PQAO is required to implement a quality system that provides sufficient information to assess the quality of the monitoring data. The quality system must, at a minimum, include the specific requirements described in this appendix. Failure to conduct or pass a required check or procedure, or a series of required checks or procedures, does not by itself invalidate data for regulatory decision making. Rather, PQAOs and the EPA shall use the checks and procedures required in this appendix in combination with other data quality information, reports, and similar documentation that demonstrate overall compliance with Part 58. Accordingly, the EPA and PQAOs shall use a “weight of evidence” approach when determining the suitability of data for regulatory decisions. The EPA reserves the authority to use or not use monitoring data submitted by a monitoring organization when making regulatory decisions based on the EPA's assessment of the quality of the data. Consensus built validation templates or validation criteria already approved in QAPPs should be used as the basis for the weight of evidence approach.</P>
              <P>1.3 <E T="03">Definitions.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Measurement Uncertainty.</E> A term used to describe deviations from a true concentration or estimate that are related to the measurement process and not to spatial or temporal population attributes of the air being measured.<PRTPAGE P="262"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Precision.</E> A measurement of mutual agreement among individual measurements of the same property usually under prescribed similar conditions, expressed generally in terms of the standard deviation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Bias.</E> The systematic or persistent distortion of a measurement process which causes errors in one direction.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Accuracy.</E> The degree of agreement between an observed value and an accepted reference value. Accuracy includes a combination of random error (imprecision) and systematic error (bias) components which are due to sampling and analytical operations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Completeness.</E> A measure of the amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under correct, normal conditions.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Detection Limit.</E> The lowest concentration or amount of target analyte that can be determined to be different from zero by a single measurement at a stated level of probability.</P>
              <P>1.4 <E T="03">Measurement Quality Checks.</E> The measurement quality checks described in section 3 of this appendix shall be reported to AQS and are included in the data required for certification.</P>
              <P>1.5 <E T="03">Assessments and Reports.</E> Periodic assessments and documentation of data quality are required to be reported to the EPA. To provide national uniformity in this assessment and reporting of data quality for all networks, specific assessment and reporting procedures are prescribed in detail in sections 3, 4, and 5 of this appendix. On the other hand, the selection and extent of the quality assurance and quality control activities used by a monitoring organization depend on a number of local factors such as field and laboratory conditions, the objectives for monitoring, the level of data quality needed, the expertise of assigned personnel, the cost of control procedures, pollutant concentration levels, etc. Therefore, quality system requirements in section 2 of this appendix are specified in general terms to allow each monitoring organization to develop a quality system that is most efficient and effective for its own circumstances while achieving the data quality objectives described in this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Quality System Requirements</HD>
              <P>A quality system (reference 1 of this appendix) is the means by which an organization manages the quality of the monitoring information it produces in a systematic, organized manner. It provides a framework for planning, implementing, assessing and reporting work performed by an organization and for carrying out required quality assurance and quality control activities.</P>
              <P>2.1 <E T="03">Quality Management Plans and Quality Assurance Project Plans.</E> All PQAOs must develop a quality system that is described and approved in quality management plans (QMP) and QAPPs to ensure that the monitoring results:</P>
              <P>(a) Meet a well-defined need, use, or purpose (reference 5 of this appendix);</P>
              <P>(b) Provide data of adequate quality for the intended monitoring objectives;</P>
              <P>(c) Satisfy stakeholder expectations;</P>
              <P>(d) Comply with applicable standards specifications;</P>
              <P>(e) Comply with statutory (and other legal) requirements; and</P>
              <P>(f) Reflect consideration of cost and economics.</P>
              <P>2.1.1 The QMP describes the quality system in terms of the organizational structure, functional responsibilities of management and staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, implementing, assessing and reporting activities involving environmental data operations (EDO). The QMP must be suitably documented in accordance with EPA requirements (reference 2 of this appendix), and approved by the appropriate Regional Administrator, or his or her representative. The quality system described in the QMP will be reviewed during the systems audits described in section 2.5 of this appendix. Organizations that implement long-term monitoring programs with EPA funds should have a separate QMP document. Smaller organizations, organizations that do infrequent work with the EPA or have monitoring programs of limited size or scope may combine the QMP with the QAPP if approved by, and subject to any conditions of the EPA. Additional guidance on this process can be found in reference 10 of this appendix. Approval of the recipient's QMP by the appropriate Regional Administrator or his or her representative may allow delegation of authority to the PQAOs independent quality assurance function to review and approve environmental data collection activities adequately described and covered under the scope of the QMP and documented in appropriate planning documents (QAPP). Where a PQAO or monitoring organization has been delegated authority to review and approve their QAPP, an electronic copy must be submitted to the EPA region at the time it is submitted to the PQAO/monitoring organization's QAPP approving authority. The QAPP will be reviewed by the EPA during systems audits or circumstances related to data quality. The QMP submission and approval dates for PQAOs/monitoring organizations must be reported to AQS either by the monitoring organization or the EPA Region.</P>

              <P>2.1.2 The QAPP is a formal document describing, in sufficient detail, the quality system that must be implemented to ensure that the results of work performed will satisfy the stated objectives. PQAOs must develop QAPPs that describe how the organization intends to control measurement uncertainty to an appropriate level in order to <PRTPAGE P="263"/>achieve the data quality objectives for the EDO. The quality assurance policy of the EPA requires every EDO to have a written and approved QAPP prior to the start of the EDO. It is the responsibility of the PQAO/monitoring organization to adhere to this policy. The QAPP must be suitably documented in accordance with EPA requirements (reference 3 of this appendix) and include standard operating procedures for all EDOs either within the document or by appropriate reference. The QAPP must identify each PQAO operating monitors under the QAPP as well as generally identify the sites and monitors to which it is applicable either within the document or by appropriate reference. The QAPP submission and approval dates must be reported to AQS either by the monitoring organization or the EPA Region.</P>
              <P>2.1.3 The PQAO/monitoring organization's quality system must have adequate resources both in personnel and funding to plan, implement, assess and report on the achievement of the requirements of this appendix and it's approved QAPP.</P>
              <P>2.2 <E T="03">Independence of Quality Assurance.</E> The PQAO must provide for a quality assurance management function, that aspect of the overall management system of the organization that determines and implements the quality policy defined in a PQAO's QMP. Quality management includes strategic planning, allocation of resources and other systematic planning activities (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> planning, implementation, assessing and reporting) pertaining to the quality system. The quality assurance management function must have sufficient technical expertise and management authority to conduct independent oversight and assure the implementation of the organization's quality system relative to the ambient air quality monitoring program and should be organizationally independent of environmental data generation activities.</P>
              <P>2.3. <E T="03">Data Quality Performance Requirements.</E>
              </P>
              <P>2.3.1 <E T="03">Data Quality Objectives.</E> The DQOs, or the results of other systematic planning processes, are statements that define the appropriate type of data to collect and specify the tolerable levels of potential decision errors that will be used as a basis for establishing the quality and quantity of data needed to support the monitoring objectives (reference 5 of this appendix). The DQOs will be developed by the EPA to support the primary regulatory objectives for each criteria pollutant. As they are developed, they will be added to the regulation. The quality of the conclusions derived from data interpretation can be affected by population uncertainty (spatial or temporal uncertainty) and measurement uncertainty (uncertainty associated with collecting, analyzing, reducing and reporting concentration data). This appendix focuses on assessing and controlling measurement uncertainty.</P>

              <P>2.4 <E T="03">National Performance Evaluation Programs.</E> The PQAO shall provide for the implementation of a program of independent and adequate audits of all monitors providing data for NAAQS compliance purposes including the provision of adequate resources for such audit programs. A monitoring plan (or QAPP) which provides for PQAO participation in the EPA's National Performance Audit Program (NPAP), the PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Performance Evaluation Program (PM<E T="52">2.5</E>-PEP) program and the Pb Performance Evaluation Program (Pb-PEP) and indicates the consent of the PQAO for the EPA to apply an appropriate portion of the grant funds, which the EPA would otherwise award to the PQAO for these QA activities, will be deemed by the EPA to meet this requirement. For clarification and to participate, PQAOs should contact either the appropriate EPA regional quality assurance (QA) coordinator at the appropriate EPA Regional Office location, or the NPAP coordinator at the EPA Air Quality Assessment Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The PQAOs that plan to implement these programs (self-implement) rather than use the federal programs must meet the adequacy requirements found in the appropriate sections that follow, as well as meet the definition of independent assessment that follows.<PRTPAGE P="264"/>
              </P>
              <P>2.4.1 <E T="03">Independent assessment.</E> An assessment performed by a qualified individual, group, or organization that is not part of the organization directly performing and accountable for the work being assessed. This auditing organization must not be involved with the generation of the ambient air monitoring data. An organization can conduct the performance evaluation (PE) if it can meet this definition and has a management structure that, at a minimum, will allow for the separation of its routine sampling personnel from its auditing personnel by two levels of management. In addition, the sample analysis of audit filters must be performed by a laboratory facility and laboratory equipment separate from the facilities used for routine sample analysis. Field and laboratory personnel will be required to meet PE field and laboratory training and certification requirements to establish comparability to federally implemented programs.</P>
              <P>2.5 <E T="03">Technical Systems Audit Program.</E> Technical systems audits of each PQAO shall be conducted at least every 3 years by the appropriate EPA Regional Office and reported to the AQS. If a PQAO is made up of more than one monitoring organization, all monitoring organizations in the PQAO should be audited within 6 years (two TSA cycles of the PQAO). As an example, if a state has five local monitoring organizations that are consolidated under one PQAO, all five local monitoring organizations should receive a technical systems audit within a 6-year period. Systems audit programs are described in reference 10 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>2.6 <E T="03">Gaseous and Flow Rate Audit Standards.</E>
              </P>

              <P>2.6.1 Gaseous pollutant concentration standards (permeation devices or cylinders of compressed gas) used to obtain test concentrations for CO, SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO, and NO<E T="52">2</E> must be traceable to either a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Traceable Reference Material (NTRM) or a NIST-certified Gas Manufacturer's Internal Standard (GMIS), certified in accordance with one of the procedures given in reference 4 of this appendix. Vendors advertising certification with the procedures provided in reference 4 of this appendix and distributing gases as “EPA Protocol Gas” for ambient air monitoring purposes must participate in the EPA Ambient Air Protocol Gas Verification Program or not use “EPA” in any form of advertising. Monitoring organizations must provide information to the EPA on the gas producers they use on an annual basis and those PQAOs purchasing standards will be obligated, at the request of the EPA, to participate in the program at least once every 5 years by sending a new unused standard to a designated verification laboratory.</P>
              <P>2.6.2 Test concentrations for O<E T="52">3</E> must be obtained in accordance with the ultraviolet photometric calibration procedure specified in appendix D to Part 50 of this chapter and by means of a certified NIST-traceable O<E T="52">3</E> transfer standard. Consult references 7 and 8 of this appendix for guidance on transfer standards for O<E T="52">3</E>.</P>
              <P>2.6.3 Flow rate measurements must be made by a flow measuring instrument that is NIST-traceable to an authoritative volume or other applicable standard. Guidance for certifying some types of flowmeters is provided in reference 10 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>2.7 <E T="03">Primary Requirements and Guidance.</E> Requirements and guidance documents for developing the quality system are contained in references 1 through 11 of this appendix, which also contain many suggested procedures, checks, and control specifications. Reference 10 describes specific guidance for the development of a quality system for data collected for comparison to the NAAQS. Many specific quality control checks and specifications for methods are included in the respective reference methods described in Part 50 of this chapter or in the respective equivalent method descriptions available from the EPA (reference 6 of this appendix). Similarly, quality control procedures related to specifically designated reference and equivalent method monitors are contained in the respective operation or instruction manuals associated with those monitors.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Measurement Quality Check Requirements</HD>
              <P>This section provides the requirements for PQAOs to perform the measurement quality checks that can be used to assess data quality. Data from these checks are required to be submitted to the AQS within the same time frame as routinely-collected ambient concentration data as described in 40 CFR 58.16. Table A-1 of this appendix provides a summary of the types and frequency of the measurement quality checks that will be described in this section.</P>

              <P>3.1.1 <E T="03">One-Point Quality Control (QC) Check for SO</E>
                <E T="52">2,</E> NO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">3</E>, and CO. (a) A one-point QC check must be performed at least once every 2 weeks on each automated monitor used to measure SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">3</E> and CO. With the advent of automated calibration systems, more frequent checking is strongly encouraged. See Reference 10 of this appendix for guidance on the review procedure. The QC check is made by challenging the monitor with a QC check gas of known concentration (effective concentration for open path monitors) between the prescribed range of 0.005 and 0.08 parts per million (ppm) for SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">2</E>, and O<E T="52">3</E>, and between the prescribed range of 0.5 and 5 ppm for CO monitors. The QC check gas concentration selected within the prescribed range should be related to the monitoring objectives for the monitor. If monitoring at an NCore site or for trace level monitoring, <PRTPAGE P="265"/>the QC check concentration should be selected to represent the mean or median concentrations at the site. If the mean or median concentrations at trace gas sites are below the MDL of the instrument the agency can select the lowest concentration in the prescribed range that can be practically achieved. If the mean or median concentrations at trace gas sites are above the prescribed range the agency can select the highest concentration in the prescribed range. An additional QC check point is encouraged for those organizations that may have occasional high values or would like to confirm the monitors' linearity at the higher end of the operational range or around NAAQS concentrations. If monitoring for NAAQS decisions, the QC concentration can be selected at a higher concentration within the prescribed range but should also consider precision points around mean or median monitor concentrations.</P>
              <P>(b) Point analyzers must operate in their normal sampling mode during the QC check and the test atmosphere must pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable. The QC check must be conducted before any calibration or adjustment to the monitor.</P>
              <P>(c) Open path monitors are tested by inserting a test cell containing a QC check gas concentration into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the test, and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be altered as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the test. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentration of the QC check gas in the test cell must be selected to produce an effective concentration in the range specified earlier in this section. Generally, the QC test concentration measurement will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the QC test concentration. As such, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the QC test from the QC check gas concentration measurement. If the difference between these before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas, discard the test result and repeat the test. If possible, open path monitors should be tested during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady.</P>
              <P>(d) Report the audit concentration of the QC gas and the corresponding measured concentration indicated by the monitor to AQS. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the precision and bias of the monitoring data as described in sections 4.1.2 (precision) and 4.1.3 (bias) of this appendix.</P>

                <E T="03">, or CO</E>. A performance evaluation must be conducted on each primary monitor once a year. This can be accomplished by evaluating 25 percent of the primary monitors each quarter. The evaluation should be conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine site operator.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.1 The evaluation is made by challenging the monitor with audit gas standards of known concentration from at least three audit levels. One point must be within two to three times the method detection limit of the instruments within the PQAOs network, the second point will be less than or equal to the 99th percentile of the data at the site or the network of sites in the PQAO or the next highest audit concentration level. The third point can be around the primary NAAQS or the highest 3-year concentration at the site or the network of sites in the PQAO. An additional 4th level is encouraged for those agencies that would like to confirm the monitors' linearity at the higher end of the operational range. In rare circumstances, there may be sites measuring concentrations above audit level 10. Notify the appropriate EPA region and the AQS program in order to make accommodations for auditing at levels above level 10.</P>

              <P>3.1.2.2 The NO<E T="52">2</E> audit techniques may vary depending on the ambient monitoring method. For chemiluminescence-type NO<E T="52">2</E> analyzers, gas phase titration (GPT) techniques should be based on EPA guidance documents and monitoring agency experience. The NO<E T="52">2</E> gas standards may be more appropriate than GPT for direct NO<E T="52">2</E> methods that do not employ converters. Care should be taken to ensure the stability of such gas standards prior to use.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.3 The standards from which audit gas test concentrations are obtained must meet the specifications of section 2.6.1 of this appendix. The gas standards and equipment used for the performance evaluation must not be the same as the standards and equipment used for one-point QC, calibrations, span evaluations or NPAP.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.4 For point analyzers, the evaluation shall be carried out by allowing the monitor to analyze the audit gas test atmosphere in its normal sampling mode such that the test atmosphere passes through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other sample inlet components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.5 Open-path monitors are evaluated by inserting a test cell containing the various audit gas concentrations into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and, as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the evaluation, and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be modified as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the evaluation. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentrations of the audit gas in the test cell must be selected to produce effective concentrations in the evaluation level ranges specified in this section of this appendix. Generally, each evaluation concentration measurement result will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the evaluation test concentration. As such, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the evaluation test (or preferably before and after each evaluation concentration level) from the evaluation concentration measurement. If the difference between the before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas standard, discard the test result for that concentration level and repeat the test for that level. If possible, open path monitors should be evaluated during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady. Also, if the open-path instrument is not installed in a permanent manner, the monitoring path length must be reverified to be within ±3 percent to validate the evaluation since the monitoring path length is critical to the determination of the effective concentration.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.6 Report both the evaluation concentrations (effective concentrations for open-path monitors) of the audit gases and the corresponding measured concentration (corrected concentrations, if applicable, for open path monitors) indicated or produced by the monitor being tested to AQS. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the quality of the monitoring data as described in section 4.1.1 of this appendix.</P>

              </P>
              <P>The NPAP is a performance evaluation which is a type of audit where quantitative data are collected independently in order to evaluate the proficiency of an analyst, monitoring instrument or laboratory. Due to the implementation approach used in the program, NPAP provides a national independent assessment of performance while maintaining a consistent level of data quality. Details of the program can be found in reference 11 of this appendix. The program requirements include:</P>
              <P>3.1.3.1 Performing audits of the primary monitors at 20 percent of monitoring sites per year, and 100 percent of the sites every 6 years. High-priority sites may be audited more frequently. Since not all gaseous criteria pollutants are monitored at every site within a PQAO, it is not required that 20 percent of the primary monitors for each pollutant receive an NPAP audit each year only that 20 percent of the PQAOs monitoring sites receive an NPAP audit. It is expected that over the 6-year period all primary monitors for all gaseous pollutants will receive an NPAP audit.</P>

              <P>3.1.3.2 Developing a delivery system that will allow for the audit concentration gasses to be introduced to the probe inlet where logistically feasible.<PRTPAGE P="267"/>
              </P>

              <P>3.1.3.3 Using audit gases that are verified against the NIST standard reference methods or special review procedures and validated annually for CO, SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">2,</E> and at the beginning of each quarter of audits for O<E T="52">3</E>.</P>
              <P>3.1.3.4 As described in section 2.4 of this appendix, the PQAO may elect, on an annual basis, to utilize the federally implemented NPAP program. If the PQAO plans to self-implement NPAP, the EPA will establish training and other technical requirements for PQAOs to establish comparability to federally implemented programs. In addition to meeting the requirements in sections 3.1.3.1 through 3.1.3.3 of this appendix, the PQAO must:</P>

These evaluations will be performed under the NPEP as described in section 2.4 of this appendix or a comparable program. Performance evaluations will be performed annually within each PQAO. For PQAOs with less than or equal to five monitoring sites, five valid performance evaluation audits must be collected and reported each year. For PQAOs with greater than five monitoring sites, eight valid performance evaluation audits must be collected and reported each year. A valid performance evaluation audit means that both the primary monitor and PEP audit concentrations are valid and above 3 µg/m<SU>3</SU>. Siting of the PEP monitor must be consistent with section 3.2.3.4(c). However, any horizontal distance greater than 4 meters and any vertical distance greater than one meter must be reported to the EPA regional PEP coordinator.

              <P>3.4.7 Pb PEP Procedures for monitoring sites other than non-source oriented NCore. The PEP is an independent assessment used to estimate total measurement system bias. These evaluations will be performed under the NPEP described in section 2.4 of this appendix or a comparable program. Each year, one performance evaluation audit must be performed at one Pb site in each primary quality assurance organization that has less than or equal to five sites and two audits at PQAOs with greater than five sites. Non-source oriented NCore sites are not counted. Siting of the PEP monitor must be consistent with section 3.4.5.3(b). However, any horizontal distance greater than 4 meters and any vertical distance greater than 1 meter must be reported to the EPA regional PEP coordinator. In addition, each year, four collocated samples from PQAOs with less than or equal to five sites and six collocated samples at PQAOs with greater than five sites must be sent to an independent laboratory, the same laboratory as the performance evaluation audit, for analysis. The calculations for evaluating bias between the primary monitor and the performance evaluation monitor for Pb are described in section 4.2.4 of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">4. Calculations for Data Quality Assessments</HD>
              <P>(a) Calculations of measurement uncertainty are carried out by the EPA according to the following procedures. The PQAOs must report the data to AQS for all measurement quality checks as specified in this appendix even though they may elect to perform some or all of the calculations in this section on their own.</P>

              <P>(b) The EPA will provide annual assessments of data quality aggregated by site and PQAO for SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">3</E> and CO and by PQAO for PM<E T="52">10</E>, PM<E T="52">2.5</E>, and Pb.</P>
              <P>(c) At low concentrations, agreement between the measurements of collocated quality control samplers, expressed as relative percent difference or percent difference, may be relatively poor. For this reason, collocated measurement pairs are selected for use in the precision and bias calculations only when both measurements are equal to or above the following limits:</P>

              </P>
              <P>(a) This appendix specifies the minimum quality assurance requirements for the control and assessment of the quality of the ambient air monitoring data submitted to a PSD reviewing authority or the EPA by an organization operating an air monitoring station, or network of stations, operated in order to comply with Part 51 New Source Review—Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD). Such organizations are encouraged to develop and maintain quality assurance programs more extensive than the required minimum. Additional guidance for the requirements reflected in this appendix can be found in the “Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems,” Volume II (Ambient Air) and “Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems,” Volume IV (Meteorological Measurements) and at a national level in references 1, 2, and 3 of this appendix.</P>

              <P>(b) It is not assumed that data generated for PSD under this appendix will be used in making NAAQS decisions. However, if all the requirements in this appendix are followed (including the NPEP programs) and reported to AQS, with review and concurrence from the EPA region, data may be used for NAAQS decisions. With the exception of the NPEP programs (NPAP, PM<E T="52">2.5</E> PEP, Pb-PEP), for which implementation is at the <PRTPAGE P="277"/>discretion of the PSD reviewing authority, all other quality assurance and quality control requirements found in the appendix must be met.</P>
              <P>1.2 <E T="03">PSD Primary Quality Assurance Organization (PQAO).</E> A PSD PQAO is defined as a monitoring organization or a coordinated aggregation of such organizations that is responsible for a set of stations within one PSD reviewing authority that monitors the same pollutant and for which data quality assessments will be pooled. Each criteria pollutant sampler/monitor must be associated with only one PSD PQAO.</P>
              <P>1.2.1 Each PSD PQAO shall be defined such that measurement uncertainty among all stations in the organization can be expected to be reasonably homogeneous, as a result of common factors. A PSD PQAO must be associated with only one PSD reviewing authority. Common factors that should be considered in defining PSD PQAOs include:</P>
              <P>(a) Operation by a common team of field operators according to a common set of procedures;</P>
              <P>(b) Use of a common QAPP and/or standard operating procedures;</P>
              <P>(c) Common calibration facilities and standards;</P>
              <P>(d) Oversight by a common quality assurance organization; and</P>
              <P>(e) Support by a common management organization or laboratory.</P>
              <P>1.2.2 PSD monitoring organizations having difficulty describing its PQAO or in assigning specific monitors to a PSD PQAO should consult with the PSD reviewing authority. Any consolidation of PSD PQAOs shall be subject to final approval by the PSD reviewing authority.</P>
              <P>1.2.3 Each PSD PQAO is required to implement a quality system that provides sufficient information to assess the quality of the monitoring data. The quality system must, at a minimum, include the specific requirements described in this appendix. Failure to conduct or pass a required check or procedure, or a series of required checks or procedures, does not by itself invalidate data for regulatory decision making. Rather, PSD PQAOs and the PSD reviewing authority shall use the checks and procedures required in this appendix in combination with other data quality information, reports, and similar documentation that demonstrate overall compliance with parts 51, 52 and 58 of this chapter. Accordingly, the PSD reviewing authority shall use a “weight of evidence” approach when determining the suitability of data for regulatory decisions. The PSD reviewing authority reserves the authority to use or not use monitoring data submitted by a PSD monitoring organization when making regulatory decisions based on the PSD reviewing authority's assessment of the quality of the data. Generally, consensus built validation templates or validation criteria already approved in quality assurance project plans (QAPPs) should be used as the basis for the weight of evidence approach.</P>
              <P>1.3 <E T="03">Definitions.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Measurement Uncertainty.</E> A term used to describe deviations from a true concentration or estimate that are related to the measurement process and not to spatial or temporal population attributes of the air being measured.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Precision.</E> A measurement of mutual agreement among individual measurements of the same property usually under prescribed similar conditions, expressed generally in terms of the standard deviation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Bias.</E> The systematic or persistent distortion of a measurement process which causes errors in one direction.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Accuracy.</E> The degree of agreement between an observed value and an accepted reference value. Accuracy includes a combination of random error (imprecision) and systematic error (bias) components which are due to sampling and analytical operations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Completeness.</E> A measure of the amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under correct, normal conditions.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Detectability.</E> The low critical range value of a characteristic that a method specific procedure can reliably discern.</P>
              <P>1.4 <E T="03">Measurement Quality Check Reporting.</E> The measurement quality checks described in section 3 of this appendix, are required to be submitted to the PSD reviewing authority within the same time frame as routinely-collected ambient concentration data as described in 40 CFR 58.16. The PSD reviewing authority may as well require that the measurement quality check data be reported to AQS.</P>
              <P>1.5 <E T="03">Assessments and Reports.</E> Periodic assessments and documentation of data quality are required to be reported to the PSD reviewing authority. To provide national uniformity in this assessment and reporting of data quality for all networks, specific assessment and reporting procedures are prescribed in detail in sections 3, 4, and 5 of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Quality System Requirements</HD>
              <P>A quality system (reference 1 of this appendix) is the means by which an organization manages the quality of the monitoring information it produces in a systematic, organized manner. It provides a framework for planning, implementing, assessing and reporting work performed by an organization and for carrying out required quality assurance and quality control activities.</P>
              <P>2.1 <E T="03">Quality Assurance Project Plans.</E> All PSD PQAOs must develop a quality system that is described and approved in quality assurance project plans (QAPP) to ensure that the monitoring results:<PRTPAGE P="278"/>
              </P>
              <P>(a) Meet a well-defined need, use, or purpose (reference 5 of this appendix);</P>
              <P>(b) Provide data of adequate quality for the intended monitoring objectives;</P>
              <P>(c) Satisfy stakeholder expectations;</P>
              <P>(d) Comply with applicable standards specifications;</P>
              <P>(e) Comply with statutory (and other legal) requirements; and</P>
              <P>(f) Assure quality assurance and quality control adequacy and independence.</P>
              <P>2.1.1 The QAPP is a formal document that describes these activities in sufficient detail and is supported by standard operating procedures. The QAPP must describe how the organization intends to control measurement uncertainty to an appropriate level in order to achieve the objectives for which the data are collected. The QAPP must be documented in accordance with EPA requirements (reference 3 of this appendix).</P>
              <P>2.1.2 The PSD PQAO's quality system must have adequate resources both in personnel and funding to plan, implement, assess and report on the achievement of the requirements of this appendix and it's approved QAPP.</P>
              <P>2.1.3 Incorporation of quality management plan (QMP) elements into the QAPP. The QMP describes the quality system in terms of the organizational structure, functional responsibilities of management and staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, implementing, assessing and reporting activities involving environmental data operations (EDO). The PSD PQAOs may combine pertinent elements of the QMP into the QAPP rather than requiring the submission of both QMP and QAPP documents separately, with prior approval of the PSD reviewing authority. Additional guidance on QMPs can be found in reference 2 of this appendix.</P>

              <P>2.2 Independence of Quality Assurance Management. The PSD PQAO must provide for a quality assurance management function for its PSD data collection operation, that aspect of the overall management system of the organization that determines and implements the quality policy defined in a PSD PQAO's QAPP. Quality management includes strategic planning, allocation of resources and other systematic planning activities (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> planning, implementation, assessing and reporting) pertaining to the quality system. The quality assurance management function must have sufficient technical expertise and management authority to conduct independent oversight and assure the implementation of the organization's quality system relative to the ambient air quality monitoring program and should be organizationally independent of environmental data generation activities.</P>
              <P>2.3 <E T="03">Data Quality Performance Requirements.</E>
              </P>
              <P>2.3.1 <E T="03">Data Quality Objectives (DQOs).</E> The DQOs, or the results of other systematic planning processes, are statements that define the appropriate type of data to collect and specify the tolerable levels of potential decision errors that will be used as a basis for establishing the quality and quantity of data needed to support air monitoring objectives (reference 5 of the appendix). The DQOs have been developed by the EPA to support attainment decisions for comparison to national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The PSD reviewing authority and the PSD monitoring organization will be jointly responsible for determining whether adherence to the EPA developed NAAQS DQOs specified in appendix A of this part are appropriate or if DQOs from a project-specific systematic planning process are necessary.</P>
              <P>2.3.1.1 <E T="03">Measurement Uncertainty for Automated and Manual PM</E>
                <E T="54">2.5</E>
                <E T="03">Methods</E>. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty for precision is defined as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient of variation (CV) of 10 percent and plus or minus 10 percent for total bias.</P>
              <P>2.3.1.2 <E T="03">Measurement Uncertainty for Automated Ozone Methods.</E> The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 7 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 7 percent.</P>
              <P>2.3.1.3 <E T="03">Measurement Uncertainty for Pb Methods.</E> The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 20 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.</P>
              <P>2.3.1.4 <E T="03">Measurement Uncertainty for NO</E>
                <E T="54">2</E>. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 15 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.</P>
              <P>2.3.1.5 <E T="03">Measurement Uncertainty for SO</E>

              <P>2.4 <E T="03">National Performance Evaluation Program.</E> Organizations operating PSD monitoring networks are required to implement the EPA's national performance evaluation program (NPEP) if the data will be used for NAAQS decisions and at the discretion of the PSD reviewing authority if PSD data are not used for NAAQS decisions. The NPEP includes the National Performance Audit Program (NPAP), the PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Performance Evaluation Program (PM<E T="52">2.5</E>-PEP) and the Pb Performance Evaluation Program (Pb-PEP). The PSD QAPP shall provide for the implementation of NPEP including the provision <PRTPAGE P="279"/>of adequate resources for such NPEP if the data will be used for NAAQS decisions or if required by the PSD reviewing authority. Contact the PSD reviewing authority to determine the best procedure for implementing the audits which may include an audit by the PSD reviewing authority, a contractor certified for the activity, or through self-implementation which is described in sections below. A determination of which entity will be performing this audit program should be made as early as possible and during the QAPP development process. The PSD PQAOs, including contractors that plan to implement these programs on behalf of PSD PQAOs, that plan to implement these programs (self-implement) rather than use the federal programs, must meet the adequacy requirements found in the appropriate sections that follow, as well as meet the definition of independent assessment that follows.</P>
              <P>2.4.1 <E T="03">Independent Assessment.</E> An assessment performed by a qualified individual, group, or organization that is not part of the organization directly performing and accountable for the work being assessed. This auditing organization must not be involved with the generation of the routinely-collected ambient air monitoring data. An organization can conduct the performance evaluation (PE) if it can meet this definition and has a management structure that, at a minimum, will allow for the separation of its routine sampling personnel from its auditing personnel by two levels of management. In addition, the sample analysis of audit filters must be performed by a laboratory facility and laboratory equipment separate from the facilities used for routine sample analysis. Field and laboratory personnel will be required to meet the performance evaluation field and laboratory training and certification requirements. The PSD PQAO will be required to participate in the centralized field and laboratory standards certification and comparison processes to establish comparability to federally implemented programs.</P>
              <P>2.5 <E T="03">Technical Systems Audit Program.</E> The PSD reviewing authority or the EPA may conduct system audits of the ambient air monitoring programs or organizations operating PSD networks. The PSD monitoring organizations shall consult with the PSD reviewing authority to verify the schedule of any such technical systems audit. Systems audit programs are described in reference 10 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>2.6 <E T="03">Gaseous and Flow Rate Audit Standards.</E>
              </P>

              <P>2.6.1 Gaseous pollutant concentration standards (permeation devices or cylinders of compressed gas) used to obtain test concentrations for carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>), nitrogen oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<E T="52">2</E>) must be traceable to either a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Traceable Reference Material (NTRM) or a NIST-certified Gas Manufacturer's Internal Standard (GMIS), certified in accordance with one of the procedures given in reference 4 of this appendix. Vendors advertising certification with the procedures provided in reference 4 of this appendix and distributing gases as “EPA Protocol Gas” must participate in the EPA Protocol Gas Verification Program or not use “EPA” in any form of advertising. The PSD PQAOs must provide information to the PSD reviewing authority on the gas vendors they use (or will use) for the duration of the PSD monitoring project. This information can be provided in the QAPP or monitoring plan, but must be updated if there is a change in the producer used.</P>
              <P>2.6.2 Test concentrations for ozone (O<E T="52">3</E>) must be obtained in accordance with the ultraviolet photometric calibration procedure specified in appendix D to Part 50, and by means of a certified NIST-traceable O<E T="52">3</E> transfer standard. Consult references 7 and 8 of this appendix for guidance on transfer standards for O<E T="52">3</E>.</P>
              <P>2.6.3 Flow rate measurements must be made by a flow measuring instrument that is NIST-traceable to an authoritative volume or other applicable standard. Guidance for certifying some types of flow-meters is provided in reference 10 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>2.7 Primary Requirements and Guidance. Requirements and guidance documents for developing the quality system are contained in references 1 through 11 of this appendix, which also contain many suggested procedures, checks, and control specifications. Reference 10 describes specific guidance for the development of a quality system for data collected for comparison to the NAAQS. Many specific quality control checks and specifications for methods are included in the respective reference methods described in Part 50 or in the respective equivalent method descriptions available from the EPA (reference 6 of this appendix). Similarly, quality control procedures related to specifically designated reference and equivalent method monitors are contained in the respective operation or instruction manuals associated with those monitors. For PSD monitoring, the use of reference and equivalent method monitors are required.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Measurement Quality Check Requirements</HD>

              <P>This section provides the requirements for PSD PQAOs to perform the measurement quality checks that can be used to assess data quality. Data from these checks are required to be submitted to the PSD reviewing authority within the same time frame as routinely-collected ambient concentration data as described in 40 CFR 58.16. Table B-1 of this appendix provides a summary of the types and frequency of the measurement <PRTPAGE P="280"/>quality checks that are described in this section. Reporting these results to AQS may be required by the PSD reviewing authority.</P>

                <E T="54">2</E>, <E T="03">O</E>
                <E T="54">3</E>, <E T="03">and CO</E>.</P>
              <P>3.1.1 <E T="03">One-Point Quality Control (QC) Check for SO</E>
                <E T="54">2,</E>
                <E T="03">NO</E>
                <E T="54">2</E>, <E T="03">O</E>
                <E T="54">3</E>, <E T="03">and</E>
                <E T="03">CO</E>. (a) A one-point QC check must be performed at least once every 2 weeks on each automated monitor used to measure SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">3</E> and CO. With the advent of automated calibration systems, more frequent checking is strongly encouraged and may be required by the PSD reviewing authority. See Reference 10 of this appendix for guidance on the review procedure. The QC check is made by challenging the monitor with a QC check gas of known concentration (effective concentration for open path monitors) between the prescribed range of 0.005 and 0.08 parts per million (ppm) for SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">2</E>, and O<E T="52">3</E>, and between the prescribed range of 0.5 and 5 ppm for CO monitors. The QC check gas concentration selected within the prescribed range should be related to monitoring objectives for the monitor. If monitoring for trace level monitoring, the QC check concentration should be selected to represent the mean or median concentrations at the site. If the mean or median concentrations at trace gas sites are below the MDL of the instrument the agency can select the lowest concentration in the prescribed range that can be practically achieved. If the mean or median concentrations at trace gas sites are above the prescribed range the agency can select the highest concentration in the prescribed range. The PSD monitoring organization will consult with the PSD reviewing authority on the most appropriate one-point QC concentration based on the objectives of the monitoring activity. An additional QC check point is encouraged for those organizations that may have occasional high values or would like to confirm the monitors' linearity at the higher end of the operational range or around NAAQS concentrations. If monitoring for NAAQS decisions the QC concentration can be selected at a higher concentration within the prescribed range but should also consider precision points around mean or median concentrations.</P>
              <P>(b) Point analyzers must operate in their normal sampling mode during the QC check and the test atmosphere must pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable. The QC check must be conducted before any calibration or adjustment to the monitor.</P>
              <P>(c) Open-path monitors are tested by inserting a test cell containing a QC check gas concentration into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the test and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be altered as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the test. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentration of the QC check gas in the test cell must be selected to produce an effective concentration in the range specified earlier in this section. Generally, the QC test concentration measurement will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the QC test concentration. As such, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the QC test from the QC check gas concentration measurement. If the difference between these before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas, discard the test result and repeat the test. If possible, open path monitors should be tested during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady.</P>
              <P>(d) Report the audit concentration of the QC gas and the corresponding measured concentration indicated by the monitor. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the precision and bias of the monitoring data as described in sections 4.1.2 (precision) and 4.1.3 (bias) of this appendix.</P>

                <E T="03">, or CO</E>. Evaluate each primary monitor each monitoring quarter (or 90 day frequency) during which monitors are operated or a least once (if operated for less than one quarter). The quarterly performance evaluation (quarterly PE) must be performed by a qualified individual, group, or organization that is not part of the organization directly performing and accountable for the work being assessed. The person or entity performing the quarterly PE must not be involved with the generation of the routinely-collected ambient air monitoring data. A PSD monitoring organization can conduct the quarterly PE itself if it can meet this definition and has a management structure that, at a minimum, will allow for the separation of its routine sampling personnel from its auditing personnel by two levels of management. The quarterly PE also requires a set of equipment and standards independent from those used for routine calibrations or zero, span or precision checks.</P>

              <P>3.1.2.1 The evaluation is made by challenging the monitor with audit gas standards of known concentration from at least three <PRTPAGE P="281"/>audit levels. One point must be within two to three times the method detection limit of the instruments within the PQAOs network, the second point will be less than or equal to the 99th percentile of the data at the site or the network of sites in the PQAO or the next highest audit concentration level. The third point can be around the primary NAAQS or the highest 3-year concentration at the site or the network of sites in the PQAO. An additional 4th level is encouraged for those PSD organizations that would like to confirm the monitor's linearity at the higher end of the operational range. In rare circumstances, there may be sites measuring concentrations above audit level 10. These sites should be identified to the PSD reviewing authority.</P>

              <P>3.1.2.2 The NO<E T="52">2</E> audit techniques may vary depending on the ambient monitoring method. For chemiluminescence-type NO<E T="52">2</E> analyzers, gas phase titration (GPT) techniques should be based on the EPA guidance documents and monitoring agency experience. The NO<E T="52">2</E> gas standards may be more appropriate than GPT for direct NO<E T="52">2</E> methods that do not employ converters. Care should be taken to ensure the stability of such gas standards prior to use.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.3 The standards from which audit gas test concentrations are obtained must meet the specifications of section 2.6.1 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.4 For point analyzers, the evaluation shall be carried out by allowing the monitor to analyze the audit gas test atmosphere in its normal sampling mode such that the test atmosphere passes through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other sample inlet components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.5 Open-path monitors are evaluated by inserting a test cell containing the various audit gas concentrations into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and, as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the evaluation, and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be modified as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the evaluation. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentrations of the audit gas in the test cell must be selected to produce effective concentrations in the evaluation level ranges specified in this section of this appendix. Generally, each evaluation concentration measurement result will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the evaluation test concentration. As such, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open-path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the evaluation test (or preferably before and after each evaluation concentration level) from the evaluation concentration measurement. If the difference between the before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas standard, discard the test result for that concentration level and repeat the test for that level. If possible, open-path monitors should be evaluated during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady. Also, if the open-path instrument is not installed in a permanent manner, the monitoring path length must be reverified to be within ±3 percent to validate the evaluation, since the monitoring path length is critical to the determination of the effective concentration.</P>

              <P>3.1.2.6 Report both the evaluation concentrations (effective concentrations for open-path monitors) of the audit gases and the corresponding measured concentration (corrected concentrations, if applicable, for open-path monitors) indicated or produced by the monitor being tested.

              <P>3.1.3 <E T="03">National Performance Audit Program (NPAP).</E>As stated in sections 1.1 and 2.4, PSD monitoring networks may be subject to the NPEP, which includes the NPAP. The NPAP is a performance evaluation which is a type of audit where quantitative data are collected independently in order to evaluate the proficiency of an analyst, monitoring instrument and laboratory. Due to the implementation approach used in this program, NPAP provides for a national independent assessment of performance with a consistent level of data quality. The NPAP should not be confused with the quarterly PE program described in section 3.1.2. The PSD organizations shall consult with the PSD reviewing authority or the EPA regarding whether the implementation of NPAP is required and the implementation options available. Details of the EPA NPAP can be found in reference 11 of this appendix. The program requirements include:</P>
              <P>3.1.3.1 Performing audits on 100 percent of monitors and sites each year including monitors and sites that may be operated for less than 1 year. The PSD reviewing authority has the authority to require more frequent audits at sites they consider to be high priority.</P>
              <P>3.1.3.2 Developing a delivery system that will allow for the audit concentration gasses to be introduced at the probe inlet where logistically feasible.</P>

              <P>3.1.3.3 Using audit gases that are verified against the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference methods or special review procedures and validated annually for CO, SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">2,</E> and at the beginning of each quarter of audits for O<E T="52">3</E>.</P>
              <P>3.1.3.4 The PSD PQAO may elect to self-implement NPAP. In these cases, the PSD reviewing authority will work with those PSD PQAOs to establish training and other technical requirements to establish comparability to federally implemented programs. In addition to meeting the requirements in sections 3.1.1.3 through 3.1.3.3, the PSD PQAO must:</P>
              <P>(a) Ensure that the PSD audit system is equivalent to the EPA NPAP audit system and is an entirely separate set of equipment and standards from the equipment used for quarterly performance evaluations. If this system does not generate and analyze the audit concentrations, as the EPA NPAP system does, its equivalence to the EPA NPAP system must be proven to be as accurate under a full range of appropriate and varying conditions as described in section 3.1.3.6.</P>
              <P>(b) Perform a whole system check by having the PSD audit system tested at an independent and qualified EPA lab, or equivalent.</P>
              <P>(c) Evaluate the system with the EPA NPAP program through collocated auditing at an acceptable number of sites each year (at least one for a PSD network of five or less sites; at least two for a network with more than five sites).</P>
              <P>(d) Incorporate the NPAP into the PSD PQAO's QAPP.</P>
              <P>(e) Be subject to review by independent, EPA-trained personnel.</P>

                <E T="54">2.5</E>. A one-point flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month (each verification minimally separated by 14 days) on each monitor used to measure PM<E T="52">2.5</E>. The verification is made by checking the operational flow rate of the monitor. If the verification is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made prior to such flow rate adjustment. For the standard procedure, use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the monitor's normal flow rate. Care should be used in selecting and using the flow rate measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor.

                <E T="54">2.5</E>. Every 6 months, audit the flow rate of the PM<E T="52">2.5</E> particulate monitors. For short-term monitoring operations (those less than 1 year), the flow rate audits must occur at start up, at the midpoint, and near the completion of the monitoring project. The audit must be conducted by a trained technician other than the routine site operator. The audit is made by measuring the monitor's normal operating flow rate using a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used for verifications or to calibrate the monitor. However, both the calibration standard and the audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume standard. Care must be taken in auditing the flow rate to be certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Report the audit flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured by the monitor. The percent differences between these flow rates are used to evaluate monitor performance.</P>

              <P>2.4.1 The candidate ARM must be demonstrated to meet the requirements for PM <E T="52">2.5</E> Class III equivalent methods as defined in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. Specifically the requirements for precision, correlation, and additive and multiplicative bias apply. For purposes of this section 2.4, the following requirements shall apply:</P>
              <P>2.4.1.1 The candidate ARM shall be tested at the site(s) in which it is intended to be used. For a network of sites operated by one reporting agency or primary quality assurance organization, the testing shall occur at a subset of sites to include one site in each MSA/CSA, up to the first 2 highest population MSA/CSA and at least one rural area or Micropolitan Statistical Area site. If the candidate ARM for a network is already approved for purposes of this section in another agency's network, subsequent testing shall minimally occur at one site in a MSA/CSA and one rural area or Micropolitan Statistical Area. There shall be no requirement for tests at any other sites.</P>
              <P>2.4.1.2 For purposes of this section, a full year of testing may begin and end in any season, so long as all seasons are covered.</P>
              <P>2.4.1.3 No PM <E T="52">10</E> samplers shall be required for the test, as determination of the PM <E T="52">2.5</E>/PM <E T="52">10</E> ratio at the test site shall not be required.</P>
              <P>2.4.1.4 The test specification for PM <E T="52">2.5</E> Class III equivalent method precision defined in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter applies; however, there is no specific requirement that collocated continuous monitors be operated for purposes of generating a statistic for coefficient of variation (CV). To provide an estimate of precision that meets the requirement identified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter, agencies may cite peer-reviewed published data or data in AQS that can be presented demonstrating the candidate ARM operated will produce data that meets the specification for precision of Class III PM <E T="52">2.5</E> methods.</P>
              <P>2.4.1.5 A minimum of 90 valid sample pairs per site for the year with no less than 20 valid sample pairs per season must be generated for use in demonstrating that additive bias, multiplicative bias and correlation meet the comparability requirements specified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. A valid sample pair may be generated with as little as one valid FRM and one valid candidate ARM measurement per day.</P>
              <P>2.4.1.6 For purposes of determining bias, FRM data with concentrations less than 3 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<SU>3</SU>) may be excluded. Exclusion of data does not result in failure of sample completeness specified in this section.</P>
              <P>2.4.1.7 Data transformations are allowed to be used to demonstrate meeting the comparability requirements specified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. Data transformation may be linear or non-linear, but must be applied in the same way to all sites used in the testing.</P>
              <P>2.4.2 The monitoring agency wishing to use an ARM must develop and implement appropriate quality assurance procedures for the method. Additionally, the following procedures are required for the method:</P>
              <P>2.4.2.1 The ARM must be consistently operated throughout the network. Exceptions to a consistent operation must be approved according to section 2.8 of this appendix;</P>
              <P>2.4.2.2 The ARM must be operated on an hourly sampling frequency capable of providing data suitable for aggregation into daily 24-hour average measurements;</P>

              <P>2.4.2.3 The ARM must use an inlet and separation device, as needed, that are already approved in either the reference method identified in appendix L to part 50 of this chapter or under part 53 of this chapter as approved for use on a PM <E T="52">2.5</E> reference or equivalent method. The only exceptions to this requirement are those methods that by their inherent measurement principle may not need an inlet or separation device that segregates the aerosol; and</P>
              <P>2.4.2.4 The ARM must be capable of providing for flow audits, unless by its inherent measurement principle, measured flow is not required. These flow audits are to be performed on the frequency identified in appendix A to this part.</P>

              <P>2.4.2.5 If data transformations are used, they must be described in the monitoring agencies Quality Assurance Project plan (or addendum to QAPP). The QAPP shall describe how often (e.g., quarterly, yearly) and under what provisions the data transformation will be updated. For example, not meeting the data quality objectives for a site over a season or year may be cause for recalculating a data transformation, but by itself would not be cause for invalidating the data. Data transformations must be applied prospectively, i.e., in real-time or near real-time, to the data output from the PM <E T="52">2.5</E> continuous method. See reference 7 of this appendix.<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
              </P>
              <P>2.4.3 The monitoring agency wishing to use the method must develop and implement appropriate procedures for assessing and reporting the precision and accuracy of the method comparable to the procedures set forth in appendix A of this part for designated reference and equivalent methods.</P>
              <P>2.4.4 Assessments of data quality shall follow the same frequencies and calculations as required under section 3 of appendix A to this part with the following exceptions:</P>
              <P>2.4.4.1 Collocation of ARM with FRM/FEM samplers must be maintained at a minimum of 30 percent of the required SLAMS sites with a minimum of 1 per network;</P>
              <P>2.4.4.2 All collocated FRM/FEM samplers must maintain a sample frequency of at least 1 in 6 sample days;</P>
              <P>2.4.4.3 Collocated FRM/FEM samplers shall be located at the design value site, with the required FRM/FEM samplers deployed among the largest MSA/CSA in the network, until all required FRM/FEM are deployed; and</P>
              <P>2.4.4.4 Data from collocated FRM/FEM are to be substituted for any calendar quarter that an ARM method has incomplete data.</P>
              <P>2.4.4.5 Collocation with an ARM under this part for purposes of determining the coefficient of variation of the method shall be conducted at a minimum of 7.5 percent of the sites with a minimum of 1 per network. This is consistent with the requirements in appendix A to this part for one-half of the required collocation of FRM/FEM (15 percent) to be collocated with the same method.</P>
              <P>2.4.4.6 Assessments of bias with an independent audit of the total measurement system shall be conducted with the same frequency as an FEM as identified in appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>2.4.5 Request for approval of a candidate ARM, that is not already approved in another agency's network under this section, must meet the general submittal requirements of section 2.7 of this appendix. Requests for approval under this section when an ARM is already approved in another agency's network are to be submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator. Requests for approval under section 2.4 of this appendix must include the following requirements:</P>
              <P>2.4.5.1 A clear and unique description of the site(s) at which the candidate ARM will be used and tested, and a description of the nature or character of the site and the particulate matter that is expected to occur there.</P>
              <P>2.4.5.2 A detailed description of the method and the nature of the sampler or analyzer upon which it is based.</P>
              <P>2.4.5.3 A brief statement of the reason or rationale for requesting the approval.</P>
              <P>2.4.5.4 A detailed description of the quality assurance procedures that have been developed and that will be implemented for the method.</P>

              <P>2.4.6 Within 120 days after receiving a request for approval of the use of an ARM at a particular site or network of sites under section 2.4 of this appendix, the Administrator will approve or disapprove the method by letter to the person or agency requesting such approval. When appropriate for methods that are already approved in another SLAMS network, the EPA Regional Administrator has approval/disapproval authority. In either instance, additional information may be requested to assist with the decision.</P>

              <P>2.7.5 After receiving a request under this section (2.7), the Administrator may request such additional testing or information or conduct such tests as may be necessary in his judgment for a decision on the request.</P>
              <P>2.7.6 If the Administrator determines, on the basis of any available information, that any of the determinations or statements on which approval of a request under this section was based are invalid or no longer valid, or that the requirements of section 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6, as applicable, have not been met, he/she may withdraw the approval after affording the person who obtained the approval an opportunity to submit information and arguments opposing such action.</P>
              <P>2.8 Modifications of Methods by Users.</P>
              <P>2.8.1 Except as otherwise provided in this section, no reference method, equivalent method, or ARM may be used in a SLAMS network if it has been modified in a manner that could significantly alter the performance characteristics of the method without prior approval by the Administrator. For purposes of this section, “alternative method” means an analyzer, the use of which has been approved under section 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6 of this appendix or some combination thereof.</P>
              <P>2.8.2 Requests for approval under this section (2.8) must meet the submittal requirements of sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.2.1 of this appendix.</P>

Unless such temporary modification is <PRTPAGE P="294"/>later approved under section 2.8.4 of this appendix, the temporarily modified method shall be repaired in accordance with the applicable operation manual as quickly as practicable but in no event later than 4 months after the temporary modification was made, unless an extension of time is granted by the Administrator. Unless and until the temporary modification is approved, air quality data obtained with the method as temporarily modified must be clearly identified as such when submitted in accordance with § 58.16 and must be accompanied by a report containing the information specified in section 2.8.3 of this appendix. A request that the Administrator approve a temporary modification may be submitted in accordance with sections 2.8.1 through 2.8.4 of this appendix. In such cases the request will be considered as if a request for prior approval had been made.</P>
              <P>2.9 Use of IMPROVE Samplers at a SLAMS Site. “IMPROVE” samplers may be used in SLAMS for monitoring of regional background and regional transport concentrations of fine particulate matter. The IMPROVE samplers were developed for use in the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network to characterize all of the major components and many trace constituents of the particulate matter that impair visibility in Federal Class I Areas. Descriptions of the IMPROVE samplers and the data they collect are available in references 4, 5, and 6 of this appendix.</P>

              <P>2.10.1.1 Pb-PM <E T="52">10</E> samplers can be approved for use at the non-source-oriented sites required under paragraph 4.5(b) of Appendix D to part 58 if there is no existing monitoring data indicating that the maximum arithmetic 3-month mean Pb concentration (either Pb-TSP or Pb-PM <E T="52">10</E>) at the site was equal to or greater than 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter during the previous 3 years.</P>
              <P>2.10.1.2 Pb-PM <E T="52">10</E> samplers can be approved for use at source-oriented sites required under paragraph 4.5(a) if the monitoring agency can demonstrate (through modeling or historic monitoring data from the last 3 years) that Pb concentrations (either Pb-TSP or Pb-PM <E T="52">10</E>) will not equal or exceed 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter on an arithmetic 3-month mean and the source is expected to emit a substantial majority of its Pb in the fraction of PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers.</P>
              <P>2.10.2 The approval of a Pb-PM <E T="52">10</E> sampler in lieu of a Pb-TSP sampler as allowed for in paragraph 2.10.1 above will be revoked if measured Pb-PM <E T="52">10</E> concentrations equal or exceed 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter on an arithmetic 3-month mean. Monitoring agencies will have up to 6 months from the end of the 3-month period in which the arithmetic 3-month Pb-PM <E T="52">10</E> mean concentration equaled or exceeded 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter to install and begin operation of a Pb-TSP sampler at the site.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this appendix is to describe monitoring objectives and general criteria to be applied in establishing the required SLAMS ambient air quality monitoring stations and for choosing general locations for additional monitoring sites. This appendix also describes specific requirements for the number and location of FRM, FEM, and ARM sites for specific pollutants, NCore multipollutant sites, PM <E T="52">10</E> mass sites, PM <E T="52">2.5</E> mass sites, chemically-speciated PM <E T="52">2.5</E> sites, and O<E T="52">3</E> precursor measurements sites (PAMS). These criteria will be used by EPA in evaluating the adequacy of the air pollutant monitoring networks.</P>
              <P>1.1 Monitoring Objectives. The ambient air monitoring networks must be designed to meet three basic monitoring objectives. These basic objectives are listed below. The appearance of any one objective in the order of this list is not based upon a prioritized scheme. Each objective is important and must be considered individually.</P>
              <P>(a) Provide air pollution data to the general public in a timely manner. Data can be presented to the public in a number of attractive ways including through air quality maps, newspapers, Internet sites, and as part of weather forecasts and public advisories.</P>

              <P>(b) Support compliance with ambient air quality standards and emissions strategy development. Data from FRM, FEM, and ARM monitors for NAAQS pollutants will be used <PRTPAGE P="296"/>for comparing an area's air pollution levels against the NAAQS. Data from monitors of various types can be used in the development of attainment and maintenance plans. SLAMS, and especially NCore station data, will be used to evaluate the regional air quality models used in developing emission strategies, and to track trends in air pollution abatement control measures' impact on improving air quality. In monitoring locations near major air pollution sources, source-oriented monitoring data can provide insight into how well industrial sources are controlling their pollutant emissions.</P>
              <P>(c) Support for air pollution research studies. Air pollution data from the NCore network can be used to supplement data collected by researchers working on health effects assessments and atmospheric processes, or for monitoring methods development work.</P>
              <P>1.1.1 In order to support the air quality management work indicated in the three basic air monitoring objectives, a network must be designed with a variety of types of monitoring sites. Monitoring sites must be capable of informing managers about many things including the peak air pollution levels, typical levels in populated areas, air pollution transported into and outside of a city or region, and air pollution levels near specific sources. To summarize some of these sites, here is a listing of six general site types:</P>
              <P>(a) Sites located to determine the highest concentrations expected to occur in the area covered by the network.</P>
              <P>(b) Sites located to measure typical concentrations in areas of high population density.</P>
              <P>(c) Sites located to determine the impact of significant sources or source categories on air quality.</P>
              <P>(d) Sites located to determine general background concentration levels.</P>
              <P>(e) Sites located to determine the extent of regional pollutant transport among populated areas; and in support of secondary standards.</P>
              <P>(f) Sites located to measure air pollution impacts on visibility, vegetation damage, or other welfare-based impacts.</P>
              <P>1.1.2 This appendix contains criteria for the basic air monitoring requirements. The total number of monitoring sites that will serve the variety of data needs will be substantially higher than these minimum requirements provide. The optimum size of a particular network involves trade-offs among data needs and available resources. This regulation intends to provide for national air monitoring needs, and to lend support for the flexibility necessary to meet data collection needs of area air quality managers. The EPA, State, and local agencies will periodically collaborate on network design issues through the network assessment process outlined in § 58.10.</P>
              <P>1.1.3 This appendix focuses on the relationship between monitoring objectives, site types, and the geographic location of monitoring sites. Included are a rationale and set of general criteria for identifying candidate site locations in terms of physical characteristics which most closely match a specific monitoring objective. The criteria for more specifically locating the monitoring site, including spacing from roadways and vertical and horizontal probe and path placement, are described in appendix E to this part.</P>
              <P>1.2 Spatial Scales. (a) To clarify the nature of the link between general monitoring objectives, site types, and the physical location of a particular monitor, the concept of spatial scale of representativeness is defined. The goal in locating monitors is to correctly match the spatial scale represented by the sample of monitored air with the spatial scale most appropriate for the monitoring site type, air pollutant to be measured, and the monitoring objective.</P>
              <P>(b) Thus, spatial scale of representativeness is described in terms of the physical dimensions of the air parcel nearest to a monitoring site throughout which actual pollutant concentrations are reasonably similar. The scales of representativeness of most interest for the monitoring site types described above are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Microscale</E>—Defines the concentrations in air volumes associated with area dimensions ranging from several meters up to about 100 meters.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Middle scale</E>—Defines the concentration typical of areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions ranging from about 100 meters to 0.5 kilometer.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Neighborhood scale</E>—Defines concentrations within some extended area of the city that has relatively uniform land use with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometers range. The neighborhood and urban scales listed below have the potential to overlap in applications that concern secondarily formed or homogeneously distributed air pollutants.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Urban scale</E>—Defines concentrations within an area of city-like dimensions, on the order of 4 to 50 kilometers. Within a city, the geographic placement of sources may result in there being no single site that can be said to represent air quality on an urban scale.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Regional scale</E>—Defines usually a rural area of reasonably homogeneous geography without large sources, and extends from tens to hundreds of kilometers.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">National and global scales</E>—These measurement scales represent concentrations characterizing the nation and the globe as a whole.</P>

              <P>(c) Proper siting of a monitor requires specification of the monitoring objective, <PRTPAGE P="297"/>the types of sites necessary to meet the objective, and then the desired spatial scale of representativeness. For example, consider the case where the objective is to determine NAAQS compliance by understanding the maximum ozone concentrations for an area. Such areas would most likely be located downwind of a metropolitan area, quite likely in a suburban residential area where children and other susceptible individuals are likely to be outdoors. Sites located in these areas are most likely to represent an urban scale of measurement. In this example, physical location was determined by considering ozone precursor emission patterns, public activity, and meteorological characteristics affecting ozone formation and dispersion. Thus, spatial scale of representativeness was not used in the selection process but was a result of site location.</P>

              <P>(d) In some cases, the physical location of a site is determined from joint consideration of both the basic monitoring objective and the type of monitoring site desired, or required by this appendix. For example, to determine PM <E T="52">2.5</E> concentrations which are typical over a geographic area having relatively high PM <E T="52">2.5</E> concentrations, a neighborhood scale site is more appropriate. Such a site would likely be located in a residential or commercial area having a high overall PM <E T="52">2.5</E> emission density but not in the immediate vicinity of any single dominant source. Note that in this example, the desired scale of representativeness was an important factor in determining the physical location of the monitoring site.</P>
              <P>(e) In either case, classification of the monitor by its type and spatial scale of representativeness is necessary and will aid in interpretation of the monitoring data for a particular monitoring objective (e.g., public reporting, NAAQS compliance, or research support).</P>
              <P>(f) Table D-1 of this appendix illustrates the relationship between the various site types that can be used to support the three basic monitoring objectives, and the scales of representativeness that are generally most appropriate for that type of site.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. General Monitoring Requirements</HD>
              <P>(a) The National ambient air monitoring system includes several types of monitoring stations, each targeting a key data collection need and each varying in technical sophistication.</P>
              <P>(b) Research grade sites are platforms for scientific studies, either involved with health or welfare impacts, measurement methods development, or other atmospheric studies. These sites may be collaborative efforts between regulatory agencies and researchers with specific scientific objectives for each. Data from these sites might be collected with both traditional and experimental techniques, and data collection might involve specific laboratory analyses not common in routine measurement programs. The research grade sites are not required by regulation; however, they are included here due to their important role in supporting the air quality management program.</P>
              <P>(c) The NCore multipollutant sites are sites that measure multiple pollutants in order to provide support to integrated air quality management data needs. NCore sites include both neighborhood and urban scale measurements in general, in a selection of metropolitan areas and a limited number of more rural locations. Continuous monitoring methods are to be used at the NCore sites when available for a pollutant to be measured, as it is important to have data collected over common time periods for integrated analyses. NCore multipollutant sites are intended to be long-term sites useful for a variety of applications including air quality trends analyses, model evaluation, and tracking metropolitan area statistics. As such, the NCore sites should be placed away from direct emission sources that could substantially impact the ability to detect area-wide concentrations. The Administrator must approve the NCore sites.</P>
              <P>(d) Monitoring sites designated as SLAMS sites, but not as NCore sites, are intended to address specific air quality management interests, and as such, are frequently single-pollutant measurement sites. The EPA Regional Administrator must approve the SLAMS sites.</P>

              <P>(e) This appendix uses the statistical-based definitions for metropolitan areas provided by the Office of Management and Budget and the Census Bureau. These areas are referred to as metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), micropolitan statistical areas, core-based statistical areas (CBSA), and combined statistical areas (CSA). A CBSA associated with at least one urbanized area of 50,000 population or greater is termed a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). A CBSA associated with at least one urbanized cluster of at least 10,000 population or greater is termed a Micropolitan Statistical Area. CSA consist <PRTPAGE P="298"/>of two or more adjacent CBSA. In this appendix, the term MSA is used to refer to a Metropolitan Statistical Area. By definition, both MSA and CSA have a high degree of integration; however, many such areas cross State or other political boundaries. MSA and CSA may also cross more than one air shed. The EPA recognizes that State or local agencies must consider MSA/CSA boundaries and their own political boundaries and geographical characteristics in designing their air monitoring networks. The EPA recognizes that there may be situations where the EPA Regional Administrator and the affected State or local agencies may need to augment or to divide the overall MSA/CSA monitoring responsibilities and requirements among these various agencies to achieve an effective network design. Full monitoring requirements apply separately to each affected State or local agency in the absence of an agreement between the affected agencies and the EPA Regional Administrator.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">3. Design Criteria for NCore Sites</HD>
              <P>(a) Each State (i.e. the fifty States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) is required to operate at least one NCore site. States may delegate this requirement to a local agency. States with many MSAs often also have multiple air sheds with unique characteristics and, often, elevated air pollution. These States include, at a minimum, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. These States are required to identify one to two additional NCore sites in order to account for their unique situations. These additional sites shall be located to avoid proximity to large emission sources. Any State or local agency can propose additional candidate NCore sites or modifications to these requirements for approval by the Administrator. The NCore locations should be leveraged with other multipollutant air monitoring sites including PAMS sites, National Air Toxics Trends Stations (NATTS) sites, CASTNET sites, and STN sites. Site leveraging includes using the same monitoring platform and equipment to meet the objectives of the variety of programs where possible and advantageous.</P>
              <P>(b) The NCore sites must measure, at a minimum, PM<E T="52">2.5</E> particle mass using continuous and integrated/filter-based samplers, speciated PM<E T="52">2.5</E>, PM<E T="52">10-2.5</E> particle mass, O<E T="52">3</E>, SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO, NO/NO<E T="52">Y</E>, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and ambient temperature.</P>
              <P>(1) Although the measurement of NO<E T="52">y</E> is required in support of a number of monitoring objectives, available commercial instruments may indicate little difference in their measurement of NO<E T="52">y</E> compared to the conventional measurement of NO<E T="52">X</E>, particularly in areas with relatively fresh sources of nitrogen emissions. Therefore, in areas with negligible expected difference between NO<E T="52">y</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> measured concentrations, the Administrator may allow for waivers that permit NO<E T="52">X</E> monitoring to be substituted for the required NO<E T="52">y</E> monitoring at applicable NCore sites.</P>
              <P>(2) The EPA recognizes that, in some cases, the physical location of the NCore site may not be suitable for representative meteorological measurements due to the site's physical surroundings. It is also possible that nearby meteorological measurements may be able to fulfill this data need. In these cases, the requirement for meteorological monitoring can be waived by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(d) Siting criteria are provided for urban and rural locations. Sites with significant historical records that do not meet siting criteria may be approved as NCore by the Administrator. Sites with the suite of NCore measurements that are explicitly designed for other monitoring objectives are exempt from these siting criteria (e.g., a near-roadway site).</P>
              <P>(1) Urban NCore stations are to be generally located at urban or neighborhood scale to provide representative concentrations of exposure expected throughout the metropolitan area; however, a middle-scale site may be acceptable in cases where the site can represent many such locations throughout a metropolitan area.</P>
              <P>(2) Rural NCore stations are to be located to the maximum extent practicable at a regional or larger scale away from any large local emission source, so that they represent ambient concentrations over an extensive area.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">4. Pollutant-Specific Design Criteria for SLAMS Sites</HD>
              <P>4.1 Ozone (O<E T="52">3</E>) Design Criteria. (a) State, and where appropriate, local agencies must operate O<E T="52">3</E> sites for various locations depending upon area size (in terms of population and geographic characteristics) and typical peak concentrations (expressed in percentages below, or near the O<E T="52">3</E> NAAQS). Specific SLAMS O<E T="52">3</E> site minimum requirements are included in Table D-2 of this appendix. The NCore sites are expected to complement the O<E T="52">3</E> data collection that takes place at single-pollutant SLAMS sites, and both types of sites can be used to meet the network minimum requirements. The total number of O<E T="52">3</E> sites needed to support the basic monitoring objectives of public data reporting, air quality mapping, compliance, and understanding O<E T="52">3</E>-related atmospheric processes will include more sites than these minimum numbers required in Table D-2 of this appendix. The EPA Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency <PRTPAGE P="299"/>must work together to design and/or maintain the most appropriate O<E T="52">3</E> network to service the variety of data needs in an area.</P>

              <P>(b) Within an O<E T="52">3</E> network, at least one O<E T="52">3</E> site for each MSA, or CSA if multiple MSAs are involved, must be designed to record the maximum concentration for that particular metropolitan area. More than one maximum concentration site may be necessary in some areas. Table D-2 of this appendix does not account for the full breadth of additional factors that would be considered in designing a complete O<E T="52">3</E> monitoring program for an area. Some of these additional factors include geographic size, population density, complexity of terrain and meteorology, adjacent O<E T="52">3</E> monitoring programs, air pollution transport from neighboring areas, and measured air quality in comparison to all forms of the O<E T="52">3</E> NAAQS (i.e., 8-hour and 1-hour forms). Networks must be designed to account for all of these area characteristics. Network designs must be re-examined in periodic network assessments. Deviations from the above O<E T="52">3</E> requirements are allowed if approved by the EPA Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) The appropriate spatial scales for O<E T="52">3</E> sites are neighborhood, urban, and regional. Since O<E T="52">3</E> requires appreciable formation time, the mixing of reactants and products occurs over large volumes of air, and this reduces the importance of monitoring small scale spatial variability.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Neighborhood scale</E>—Measurements in this category represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region, with dimensions of a few kilometers. Homogeneity refers to pollutant concentrations. Neighborhood scale data will provide valuable information for developing, testing, and revising concepts and models that describe urban/regional concentration patterns. These data will be useful to the understanding and definition of processes that take periods of hours to occur and hence involve considerable mixing and transport. Under stagnation conditions, a site located in the neighborhood scale may also experience peak concentration levels within a metropolitan area.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Urban scale</E>—Measurement in this scale will be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions of several kilometers to 50 or more kilometers. Such measurements will be used for determining trends, and designing area-wide control strategies. The urban scale sites would also be used to measure high concentrations downwind of the area having the highest precursor emissions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Regional scale</E>—This scale of measurement will be used to typify concentrations over large portions of a metropolitan area and even larger areas with dimensions of as much as hundreds of kilometers. Such measurements will be useful for assessing the O<E T="52">3</E> that is transported to and from a metropolitan area, as well as background concentrations. In some situations, particularly when considering very large metropolitan areas with complex source mixtures, regional scale sites can be the maximum concentration location.</P>
              <P>(d) EPA's technical guidance documents on O<E T="52">3</E> monitoring network design should be used to evaluate the adequacy of each existing O<E T="52">3</E> monitor, to relocate an existing site, or to locate any new O<E T="52">3</E> sites.</P>

              <P>(e) For locating a neighborhood scale site to measure typical city concentrations, a reasonably homogeneous geographical area near the center of the region should be selected which is also removed from the influence of major NO<E T="52">X</E> sources. For an urban scale site to measure the high concentration areas, the emission inventories should be used to define the extent of the area of important nonmethane hydrocarbons and NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions. The meteorological conditions that occur during periods of maximum photochemical activity should be determined. These periods can be identified by examining the meteorological conditions that occur on the highest O<E T="52">3</E> air quality days. Trajectory analyses, an evaluation of wind and emission patterns on high O<E T="52">3</E> days, can also be useful in evaluating an O<E T="52">3</E> monitoring network. In areas without any previous O<E T="52">3</E> air quality measurements, meteorological and O<E T="52">3</E> precursor emissions information would be useful.</P>

              <P>(f) Once the meteorological and air quality data are reviewed, the prospective maximum concentration monitor site should be selected in a direction from the city that is most likely to observe the highest O<E T="52">3</E> concentrations, more specifically, downwind during periods of photochemical activity. In many cases, these maximum concentration O<E T="52">3</E> sites will be located 10 to 30 miles or more downwind from the urban area where maximum O<E T="52">3</E> precursor emissions originate. The downwind direction and appropriate distance <PRTPAGE P="300"/>should be determined from historical meteorological data collected on days which show the potential for producing high O<E T="52">3</E> levels. Monitoring agencies are to consult with their EPA Regional Office when considering siting a maximum O<E T="52">3</E> concentration site.</P>
              <P>(g) In locating a neighborhood scale site which is to measure high concentrations, the same procedures used for the urban scale are followed except that the site should be located closer to the areas bordering on the center city or slightly further downwind in an area of high density population.</P>

              <P>(h) For regional scale background monitoring sites, similar meteorological analysis as for the maximum concentration sites may also inform the decisions for locating regional scale sites. Regional scale sites may be located to provide data on O<E T="52">3</E> transport between cities, as background sites, or for other data collection purposes. Consideration of both area characteristics, such as meteorology, and the data collection objectives, such as transport, must be jointly considered for a regional scale site to be useful.</P>

              <P>(i) Ozone monitoring is required at SLAMS monitoring sites only during the seasons of the year that are conducive to O<E T="52">3</E> formation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> “ozone season”) as described below in Table D-3 of this appendix. These O<E T="52">3</E> seasons are also identified in the AQS files on a state-by-state basis. Deviations from the O<E T="52">3</E> monitoring season must be approved by the EPA Regional Administrator. These requests will be reviewed by Regional Administrators taking into consideration, at a minimum, the frequency of out-of-season O<E T="52">3</E> NAAQS exceedances, as well as occurrences of the Moderate air quality index level, regional consistency, and logistical issues such as site access. Any deviations based on the Regional Administrator's waiver of requirements must be described in the annual monitoring network plan and updated in AQS. Changes to the O<E T="52">3</E> monitoring season requirements in Table D-3 revoke all previously approved Regional Administrator waivers. Requests for monitoring season deviations must be accompanied by relevant supporting information. Information on how to analyze O<E T="52">3</E> data to support a change to the O<E T="52">3</E> season in support of the 8-hour standard for the entire network in a specific state can be found in reference 8 to this appendix. Ozone monitors at NCore stations are required to be operated year-round (January to December).</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO) Design Criteria</HD>

              <P>4.2.1 General Requirements. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), one CO monitor is required to operate collocated with one required near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitor, as required in Section 4.3.2 of this part, in CBSAs having a population of 1,000,000 or more persons. If a CBSA has more than one required near-road <PRTPAGE P="301"/>NO<E T="52">2</E> monitor, only one CO monitor is required to be collocated with a near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitor within that CBSA.</P>

              <P>(b) If a state provides quantitative evidence demonstrating that peak ambient CO concentrations would occur in a near-road location which meets microscale siting criteria in Appendix E of this part but is not a near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring site, then the EPA Regional Administrator may approve a request by a state to use such an alternate near-road location for a CO monitor in place of collocating a monitor at near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring site.</P>
              <P>4.2.2 Regional Administrator Required Monitoring. (a) The Regional Administrators, in collaboration with states, may require additional CO monitors above the minimum number of monitors required in 4.2.1 of this part, where the minimum monitoring requirements are not sufficient to meet monitoring objectives. The Regional Administrator may require, at his/her discretion, additional monitors in situations where data or other information suggest that CO concentrations may be approaching or exceeding the NAAQS. Such situations include, but are not limited to, (1) characterizing impacts on ground-level concentrations due to stationary CO sources, (2) characterizing CO concentrations in downtown areas or urban street canyons, and (3) characterizing CO concentrations in areas that are subject to high ground level CO concentrations particularly due to or enhanced by topographical and meteorological impacts. The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency shall work together to design and maintain the most appropriate CO network to address the data needs for an area, and include all monitors under this provision in the annual monitoring network plan.</P>
              <P>4.2.3 CO Monitoring Spatial Scales. (a) Microscale and middle scale measurements are the most useful site classifications for CO monitoring sites since most people have the potential for exposure on these scales. Carbon monoxide maxima occur primarily in areas near major roadways and intersections with high traffic density and often in areas with poor atmospheric ventilation.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Microscale</E>—Microscale measurements typically represent areas in close proximity to major roadways, within street canyons, over sidewalks, and in some cases, point and area sources. Emissions on roadways result in high ground level CO concentrations at the microscale, where concentration gradients generally exhibit a marked decrease with increasing downwind distance from major roads, or within downtown areas including urban street canyons. Emissions from stationary point and area sources, and non-road sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Middle scale</E>—Middle scale measurements are intended to represent areas with dimensions from 100 meters to 0.5 kilometer. In certain cases, middle scale measurements may apply to areas that have a total length of several kilometers, such as “line” emission source areas. This type of emission sources areas would include air quality along a commercially developed street or shopping plaza, freeway corridors, parking lots and feeder streets.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Neighborhood scale</E>—Neighborhood scale measurements are intended to represent areas with dimensions from 0.5 kilometers to 4 kilometers. Measurements of CO in this category would represent conditions throughout some reasonably urban sub-regions. In some cases, neighborhood scale data may represent not only the immediate neighborhood spatial area, but also other similar such areas across the larger urban area. Neighborhood scale measurements provide relative area-wide concentration data which are useful for providing relative urban background concentrations, supporting health and scientific research, and for use in modeling.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.3 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<E T="54">2</E>) Design Criteria</HD>
              <P>4.3.1 General Requirements</P>

              <P>(a) State and, where appropriate, local agencies must operate a minimum number of required NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring sites as described below.</P>
              <P>4.3.2 Requirement for Near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> Monitors</P>
              <P>(a) Within the NO<E T="52">2</E> network, there must be one microscale near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring station in each CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons to monitor a location of expected maximum hourly concentrations sited near a major road with high AADT counts as specified in paragraph 4.3.2(a)(1) of this appendix. An additional near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring station is required for any CBSA with a population of 2,500,000 persons or more, or in any CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons that has one or more roadway segments with 250,000 or greater AADT counts to monitor a second location of expected maximum hourly concentrations. CBSA populations shall be based on the latest available census figures.</P>
              <P>(1) The near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring sites shall be selected by ranking all road segments within a CBSA by AADT and then identifying a location or locations adjacent to those highest ranked road segments, considering fleet mix, roadway design, congestion patterns, terrain, and meteorology, where maximum hourly NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations are expected to occur and siting criteria can be met in accordance with appendix E of this part. Where a state or local air monitoring <PRTPAGE P="302"/>agency identifies multiple acceptable candidate sites where maximum hourly NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations are expected to occur, the monitoring agency shall consider the potential for population exposure in the criteria utilized to select the final site location. Where one CBSA is required to have two near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring stations, the sites shall be differentiated from each other by one or more of the following factors: fleet mix; congestion patterns; terrain; geographic area within the CBSA; or different route, interstate, or freeway designation.</P>
              <P>(b) Measurements at required near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitor sites utilizing chemiluminescence FRMs must include at a minimum: NO, NO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E>.</P>
              <P>4.3.3 Requirement for Area-wide NO<E T="52">2</E> Monitoring</P>
              <P>(a) Within the NO<E T="52">2</E> network, there must be one monitoring station in each CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons to monitor a location of expected highest NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations representing the neighborhood or larger spatial scales. PAMS sites collecting NO<E T="52">2</E> data that are situated in an area of expected high NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations at the neighborhood or larger spatial scale may be used to satisfy this minimum monitoring requirement when the NO<E T="52">2</E> monitor is operated year round. Emission inventories and meteorological analysis should be used to identify the appropriate locations within a CBSA for locating required area-wide NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring stations. CBSA populations shall be based on the latest available census figures.</P>
              <P>4.3.4 Regional Administrator Required Monitoring</P>

              <P>(a) The Regional Administrators, in collaboration with States, must require a minimum of forty additional NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring stations nationwide in any area, inside or outside of CBSAs, above the minimum monitoring requirements, with a primary focus on siting these monitors in locations to protect susceptible and vulnerable populations. The Regional Administrators, working with States, may also consider additional factors described in paragraph (b) below to require monitors beyond the minimum network requirement.</P>
              <P>(b) The Regional Administrators may require monitors to be sited inside or outside of CBSAs in which:</P>

              <P>(i) The required near-road monitors do not represent all locations of expected maximum hourly NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations in an area and NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations may be approaching or exceeding the NAAQS in that area;</P>

              <P>(ii) Areas that are not required to have a monitor in accordance with the monitoring requirements and NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations may be approaching or exceeding the NAAQS; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The minimum monitoring requirements for area-wide monitors are not sufficient to meet monitoring objectives.</P>

              <P>(c) The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency should work together to design and/or maintain the most appropriate NO<E T="52">2</E> network to address the data needs for an area, and include all monitors under this provision in the annual monitoring network plan.</P>
              <P>4.3.5 NO<E T="52">2</E> Monitoring Spatial Scales</P>
              <P>(a) The most important spatial scale for near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring stations to effectively characterize the maximum expected hourly NO<E T="52">2</E> concentration due to mobile source emissions on major roadways is the microscale. The most important spatial scales for other monitoring stations characterizing maximum expected hourly NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations are the microscale and middle scale. The most important spatial scale for area-wide monitoring of high NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations is the neighborhood scale.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Microscale</E>—This scale represents areas in close proximity to major roadways or point and area sources. Emissions from roadways result in high ground level NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations at the microscale, where concentration gradients generally exhibit a marked decrease with increasing downwind distance from major roads. As noted in appendix E of this part, near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring stations are required to be within 50 meters of target road segments in order to measure expected peak concentrations. Emissions from stationary point and area sources, and non-road sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. The microscale typically represents an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Middle scale</E>—This scale generally represents air quality levels in areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions on the order of approximately 100 meters to 500 meters. The middle scale may include locations of expected maximum hourly concentrations due to proximity to major NO<E T="52">2</E> point, area, and/or non-road sources.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Neighborhood scale</E>—The neighborhood scale represents air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Emissions from stationary point and area sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high NO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations at the neighborhood scale. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate NO<E T="52">2</E> sources, the site may be useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Urban scale</E>—Measurements in this scale would be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing <PRTPAGE P="303"/>trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Urban scale sites may also support other monitoring objectives of the NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring network identified in paragraph 4.3.4 above.</P>
              <P>4.3.6 NO<E T="52">y</E> Monitoring</P>
              <P>(a) NO/NO<E T="52">y</E> measurements are included within the NCore multi-pollutant site requirements and the PAMS program. These NO/NO<E T="52">y</E> measurements will produce conservative estimates for NO<E T="52">2</E> that can be used to ensure tracking continued compliance with the NO<E T="52">2</E> NAAQS. NO/NO<E T="52">y</E> monitors are used at these sites because it is important to collect data on total reactive nitrogen species for understanding O<E T="52">3</E> photochemistry.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.4 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>) Design Criteria.</HD>
              <P>4.4.1 <E T="03">General Requirements.</E> (a) State and, where appropriate, local agencies must operate a minimum number of required SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring sites as described below.</P>
              <P>4.4.2 <E T="03">Requirement for Monitoring by the Population Weighted Emissions Index.</E> (a) The population weighted emissions index (PWEI) shall be calculated by States for each core based statistical area (CBSA) they contain or share with another State or States for use in the implementation of or adjustment to the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring network. The PWEI shall be calculated by multiplying the population of each CBSA, using the most current census data or estimates, and the total amount of SO<E T="52">2</E> in tons per year emitted within the CBSA area, using an aggregate of the most recent county level emissions data available in the National Emissions Inventory for each county in each CBSA. The resulting product shall be divided by one million, providing a PWEI value, the units of which are million persons-tons per year. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 1,000,000, a minimum of three SO<E T="52">2</E> monitors are required within that CBSA. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 100,000, but less than 1,000,000, a minimum of two SO<E T="52">2</E> monitors are required within that CBSA. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 5,000, but less than 100,000, a minimum of one SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor is required within that CBSA.</P>
              <P>(1) The SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring site(s) required as a result of the calculated PWEI in each CBSA shall satisfy minimum monitoring requirements if the monitor is sited within the boundaries of the parent CBSA and is one of the following site types (as defined in section 1.1.1 of this appendix): population exposure, highest concentration, source impacts, general background, or regional transport. SO<E T="52">2</E> monitors at NCore stations may satisfy minimum monitoring requirements if that monitor is located within a CBSA with minimally required monitors under this part. Any monitor that is sited outside of a CBSA with minimum monitoring requirements to assess the highest concentration resulting from the impact of significant sources or source categories existing within that CBSA shall be allowed to count towards minimum monitoring requirements for that CBSA.</P>
              <P>4.4.3 <E T="03">Regional Administrator Required Monitoring.</E> (a) The Regional Administrator may require additional SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring stations above the minimum number of monitors required in 4.4.2 of this part, where the minimum monitoring requirements are not sufficient to meet monitoring objectives. The Regional Administrator may require, at his/her discretion, additional monitors in situations where an area has the potential to have concentrations that may violate or contribute to the violation of the NAAQS, in areas impacted by sources which are not conducive to modeling, or in locations with susceptible and vulnerable populations, which are not monitored under the minimum monitoring provisions described above. The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency shall work together to design and/or maintain the most appropriate SO<E T="52">2</E> network to provide sufficient data to meet monitoring objectives.</P>
              <P>4.4.4 SO<E T="52">2</E>
                <E T="03">Monitoring Spatial Scales.</E> (a) The appropriate spatial scales for SO<E T="52">2</E> SLAMS monitors are the microscale, middle, neighborhood, and urban scales. Monitors sited at the microscale, middle, and neighborhood scales are suitable for determining maximum hourly concentrations for SO<E T="52">2</E>. Monitors sited at urban scales are useful for identifying SO<E T="52">2</E> transport, trends, and, if sited upwind of local sources, background concentrations.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Microscale</E>—This scale would typify areas in close proximity to SO<E T="52">2</E> point and area sources. Emissions from stationary point and area sources, and non-road sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. The microscale typically represents an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Middle scale</E>—This scale generally represents air quality levels in areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions on the order of approximately 100 meters to 500 meters. The middle scale may include locations of expected maximum short-term concentrations due to proximity to major SO<E T="52">2</E> point, area, and/or non-road sources.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Neighborhood scale</E>—The neighborhood scale would characterize air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Emissions from stationary point and area sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations at the neighborhood scale. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate SO<E T="52">2</E> sources, the site may be <PRTPAGE P="304"/>useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Urban scale</E>—Measurements in this scale would be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Urban scale sites may also support other monitoring objectives of the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring network such as identifying trends, and when monitors are sited upwind of local sources, background concentrations.</P>
              <P>4.4.5 <E T="03">NCore Monitoring.</E> (a) SO<E T="52">2</E> measurements are included within the NCore multipollutant site requirements as described in paragraph (3)(b) of this appendix. NCore-based SO<E T="52">2</E> measurements are primarily used to characterize SO<E T="52">2</E> trends and assist in understanding SO<E T="52">2</E> transport across representative areas in urban or rural locations and are also used for comparison with the SO<E T="52">2</E> NAAQS. SO<E T="52">2</E> monitors at NCore sites that exist in CBSAs with minimum monitoring requirements per section 4.4.2 above shall be allowed to count towards those minimum monitoring requirements.</P>
              <P>4.5 <E T="03">Lead (Pb) Design Criteria.</E> (a) State and, where appropriate, local agencies are required to conduct ambient air Pb monitoring near Pb sources which are expected to or have been shown to contribute to a maximum Pb concentration in ambient air in excess of the NAAQS, taking into account the logistics and potential for population exposure. At a minimum, there must be one source-oriented SLAMS site located to measure the maximum Pb concentration in ambient air resulting from each non-airport Pb source which emits 0.50 or more tons per year and from each airport which emits 1.0 or more tons per year based on either the most recent National Emission Inventory (<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html</E>) or other scientifically justifiable methods and data (such as improved emissions factors or site-specific data) taking into account logistics and the potential for population exposure.</P>
              <P>(i) One monitor may be used to meet the requirement in paragraph 4.5(a) for all sources involved when the location of the maximum Pb concentration due to one Pb source is expected to also be impacted by Pb emissions from a nearby source (or multiple sources). This monitor must be sited, taking into account logistics and the potential for population exposure, where the Pb concentration from all sources combined is expected to be at its maximum.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator may waive the requirement in paragraph 4.5(a) for monitoring near Pb sources if the State or, where appropriate, local agency can demonstrate the Pb source will not contribute to a maximum Pb concentration in ambient air in excess of 50 percent of the NAAQS (based on historical monitoring data, modeling, or other means). The waiver must be renewed once every 5 years as part of the network assessment required under § 58.10(d).</P>
              <P>(iii) State and, where appropriate, local agencies are required to conduct ambient air Pb monitoring near each of the airports listed in Table D-3A for a period of 12 consecutive months commencing no later than December 27, 2011. Monitors shall be sited to measure the maximum Pb concentration in ambient air, taking into account logistics and the potential for population exposure, and shall use an approved Pb-TSP Federal Reference Method or Federal Equivalent Method. Any monitor that exceeds 50 percent of the Pb NAAQS on a rolling 3-month average (as determined according to 40 CFR part 50, Appendix R) shall become a required monitor under paragraph 4.5(c) of this Appendix, and shall continue to monitor for Pb unless a waiver is granted allowing it to stop operating as allowed by the provisions in paragraph 4.5(a)(ii) of this appendix. Data collected shall be submitted to the Air Quality System database according to the requirements of 40 CFR part 58.16.</P>

              <P>(c) The EPA Regional Administrator may require additional monitoring beyond the minimum monitoring requirements contained in paragraph 4.5(a) of this appendix where the likelihood of Pb air quality violations is significant or where the emissions density, topography, or population locations are complex and varied. The EPA Regional Administrators may require additional monitoring at locations including, but not limited to, those near existing additional industrial sources of Pb, recently closed industrial sources of Pb, airports where piston-engine <PRTPAGE P="305"/>aircraft emit Pb, and other sources of re-entrained Pb dust.</P>
              <P>(d) The most important spatial scales for source-oriented sites to effectively characterize the emissions from point sources are microscale and middle scale. The most important spatial scale for non-source-oriented sites to characterize typical lead concentrations in urban areas is the neighborhood scale. Monitor siting should be conducted in accordance with 4.5(a)(i) with respect to source-oriented sites.</P>
              <P>(1) Microscale—This scale would typify areas in close proximity to lead point sources. Emissions from point sources such as primary and secondary lead smelters, and primary copper smelters may under fumigation conditions likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. In the latter case, the microscale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Pb monitors in areas where the public has access, and particularly children have access, are desirable because of the higher sensitivity of children to exposures of elevated Pb concentrations.</P>
              <P>(2) Middle scale—This scale generally represents Pb air quality levels in areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions on the order of approximately 100 meters to 500 meters. The middle scale may for example, include schools and playgrounds in center city areas which are close to major Pb point sources. Pb monitors in such areas are desirable because of the higher sensitivity of children to exposures of elevated Pb concentrations (reference 3 of this appendix). Emissions from point sources frequently impact on areas at which single sites may be located to measure concentrations representing middle spatial scales.</P>
              <P>(3) Neighborhood scale—The neighborhood scale would characterize air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Sites of this scale would provide monitoring data in areas representing conditions where children live and play. Monitoring in such areas is important since this segment of the population is more susceptible to the effects of Pb. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate Pb sources, the site may be very useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.</P>
              <P>(d) Technical guidance is found in references 4 and 5 of this appendix. These documents provide additional guidance on locating sites to meet specific urban area monitoring objectives and should be used in locating new sites or evaluating the adequacy of existing sites.</P>
              <P>4.6 Particulate Matter (PM <E T="52">10</E>) Design Criteria.&gt;(a) Table D-4 indicates the approximate number of permanent stations required in MSAs to characterize national and regional PM <E T="52">10</E> air quality trends and geographical patterns. The number of PM <E T="52">10</E> stations in areas where MSA populations exceed 1,000,000 must be in the range from 2 to 10 stations, while in low population urban areas, no more than two stations are required. A range of monitoring stations is specified in Table D-4 because sources of pollutants and local control efforts can vary from one part of the country to another and therefore, some flexibility is allowed in selecting the actual number of stations in any one locale. Modifications from these PM <E T="52">10</E> monitoring requirements must be approved by the Regional Administrator.</P>

              <P>(b) Although microscale monitoring may be appropriate in some circumstances, the most important spatial scales to effectively characterize the emissions of PM <E T="52">10</E> from both mobile and stationary sources are the middle scales and neighborhood scales.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Microscale</E>—This scale would typify areas such as downtown street canyons, traffic corridors, and fence line stationary <PRTPAGE P="306"/>source monitoring locations where the general public could be exposed to maximum PM <E T="52">10</E> concentrations. Microscale particulate matter sites should be located near inhabited buildings or locations where the general public can be expected to be exposed to the concentration measured. Emissions from stationary sources such as primary and secondary smelters, power plants, and other large industrial processes may, under certain plume conditions, likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. In the latter case, the microscale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at microscale sites provide information for evaluating and developing hot spot control measures.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Middle scale</E>—Much of the short-term public exposure to coarse fraction particles (PM <E T="52">10</E>) is on this scale and on the neighborhood scale. People moving through downtown areas or living near major roadways or stationary sources, may encounter particulate pollution that would be adequately characterized by measurements of this spatial scale. Middle scale PM <E T="52">10</E> measurements can be appropriate for the evaluation of possible short-term exposure public health effects. In many situations, monitoring sites that are representative of micro-scale or middle-scale impacts are not unique and are representative of many similar situations. This can occur along traffic corridors or other locations in a residential district. In this case, one location is representative of a neighborhood of small scale sites and is appropriate for evaluation of long-term or chronic effects. This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as the parking lot and feeder streets associated with shopping centers, stadia, and office buildings. In the case of PM <E T="52">10</E>, unpaved or seldomly swept parking lots associated with these sources could be an important source in addition to the vehicular emissions themselves.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Neighborhood scale</E>—Measurements in this category represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface characteristics. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent not only the immediate neighborhood but also neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. Neighborhood scale PM <E T="52">10</E> sites provide information about trends and compliance with standards because they often represent conditions in areas where people commonly live and work for extended periods. Neighborhood scale data could provide valuable information for developing, testing, and revising models that describe the larger-scale concentration patterns, especially those models relying on spatially smoothed emission fields for inputs. The neighborhood scale measurements could also be used for neighborhood comparisons within or between cities.</P>

              <P>(b) Specific Design Criteria for PM <E T="52">2.5</E>. The required monitoring stations or sites must be sited to represent area-wide air quality. These sites can include sites collocated at PAMS. These monitoring stations will typically be at neighborhood or urban-scale; however, micro-or middle-scale PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitoring sites that represent many such locations throughout a metropolitan area are considered to represent area-wide air quality.</P>
              <P>(1) At least one monitoring station is to be sited at neighborhood or larger scale in an area of expected maximum concentration.</P>

              <P>(2) For CBSAs with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons, at least one PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitor is to be collocated at a near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> station required in section 4.3.2(a) of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(3) For areas with additional required SLAMS, a monitoring station is to be sited in an area of poor air quality.</P>
              <P>(4) Additional technical guidance for siting PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitors is provided in references 6 and 7 of this appendix.<PRTPAGE P="307"/>
              </P>

              <P>(c) The most important spatial scale to effectively characterize the emissions of particulate matter from both mobile and stationary sources is the neighborhood scale for PM <E T="52">2.5</E>. For purposes of establishing monitoring sites to represent large homogenous areas other than the above scales of representativeness and to characterize regional transport, urban or regional scale sites would also be needed. Most PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitoring in urban areas should be representative of a neighborhood scale.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Micro-scale.</E> This scale would typify areas such as downtown street canyons and traffic corridors where the general public would be exposed to maximum concentrations from mobile sources. In some circumstances, the micro-scale is appropriate for particulate sites. SLAMS sites measured at the micro-scale level should, however, be limited to urban sites that are representative of long-term human exposure and of many such microenvironments in the area. In general, micro-scale particulate matter sites should be located near inhabited buildings or locations where the general public can be expected to be exposed to the concentration measured. Emissions from stationary sources such as primary and secondary smelters, power plants, and other large industrial processes may, under certain plume conditions, likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the micro-scale. In the latter case, the micro-scale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at micro-scale sites provide information for evaluating and developing hot spot control measures.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Middle scale</E>—People moving through downtown areas, or living near major roadways, encounter particle concentrations that would be adequately characterized by this spatial scale. Thus, measurements of this type would be appropriate for the evaluation of possible short-term exposure public health effects of particulate matter pollution. In many situations, monitoring sites that are representative of microscale or middle-scale impacts are not unique and are representative of many similar situations. This can occur along traffic corridors or other locations in a residential district. In this case, one location is representative of a number of small scale sites and is appropriate for evaluation of long-term or chronic effects. This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as the parking lot and feeder streets associated with shopping centers, stadia, and office buildings.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Neighborhood scale</E>—Measurements in this category would represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface characteristics. Much of the PM <E T="52">2.5</E> exposures are expected to be associated with this scale of measurement. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent the immediate neighborhood as well as neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. PM <E T="52">2.5</E> sites of this kind provide good information about trends and compliance with standards because they often represent conditions in areas where people commonly live and work for periods comparable to those specified in the NAAQS. In general, most PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitoring in urban areas should have this scale.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Urban scale</E>—This class of measurement would be used to characterize the particulate matter concentration over an entire metropolitan or rural area ranging in size from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Community-oriented PM <E T="52">2.5</E> sites may have this scale.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Regional scale</E>—These measurements would characterize conditions over areas with dimensions of as much as hundreds of kilometers. As noted earlier, using representative conditions for an area implies some degree of homogeneity in that area. For this reason, regional scale measurements would be most applicable to sparsely populated areas. Data characteristics of this scale would provide information about larger scale processes of particulate matter emissions, losses and transport. PM <E T="52">2.5</E> transport contributes to elevated particulate concentrations and may affect multiple urban and State entities with large populations such as in the eastern United States. Development of effective pollution control strategies requires an understanding at regional geographical scales of the emission sources and atmospheric processes that are responsible for elevated PM <E T="52">2.5</E> levels and may also be associated with elevated O<E T="52">3</E> and regional haze.</P>
              <P>4.7.2 Requirement for Continuous PM <E T="52">2.5</E> Monitoring. The State, or where appropriate, local agencies must operate continuous PM <E T="52">2.5</E> analyzers equal to at least one-half (round up) the minimum required sites listed in Table D-5 of this appendix. At least one required continuous analyzer in each MSA must be collocated with one of the required FRM/FEM/ARM monitors, unless at least one of the required FRM/FEM/ARM monitors is itself a continuous FEM or ARM monitor in which case no collocation requirement applies. State and local air monitoring agencies must use methodologies and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures <PRTPAGE P="308"/>approved by the EPA Regional Administrator for these required continuous analyzers.</P>
              <P>4.7.3 Requirement for PM <E T="52">2.5</E> Background and Transport Sites. Each State shall install and operate at least one PM <E T="52">2.5</E> site to monitor for regional background and at least one PM <E T="52">2.5</E> site to monitor regional transport. These monitoring sites may be at community-oriented sites and this requirement may be satisfied by a corresponding monitor in an area having similar air quality in another State. State and local air monitoring agencies must use methodologies and QA/QC procedures approved by the EPA Regional Administrator for these sites. Methods used at these sites may include non-federal reference method samplers such as IMPROVE or continuous PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitors.</P>
              <P>4.7.4 PM <E T="52">2.5</E> Chemical Speciation Site Requirements. Each State shall continue to conduct chemical speciation monitoring and analyses at sites designated to be part of the PM <E T="52">2.5</E> Speciation Trends Network (STN). The selection and modification of these STN sites must be approved by the Administrator. The PM <E T="52">2.5</E> chemical speciation urban trends sites shall include analysis for elements, selected anions and cations, and carbon. Samples must be collected using the monitoring methods and the sampling schedules approved by the Administrator. Chemical speciation is encouraged at additional sites where the chemically resolved data would be useful in developing State implementation plans and supporting atmospheric or health effects related studies.</P>
              <P>4.8 Coarse Particulate Matter (PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E>) Design Criteria.</P>

              <P>4.8.1 General Monitoring Requirements. (a) The only required monitors for PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> are those required at NCore Stations.</P>

              <P>(b) Although microscale monitoring may be appropriate in some circumstances, middle and neighborhood scale measurements are the most important station classifications for PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> to assess the variation in coarse particle concentrations that would be expected across populated areas that are in proximity to large emissions sources.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Microscale</E>—This scale would typify relatively small areas immediately adjacent to: Industrial sources; locations experiencing ongoing construction, redevelopment, and soil disturbance; and heavily traveled roadways. Data collected at microscale stations would characterize exposure over areas of limited spatial extent and population exposure, and may provide information useful for evaluating and developing source-oriented control measures.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Middle scale</E>—People living or working near major roadways or industrial districts encounter particle concentrations that would be adequately characterized by this spatial scale. Thus, measurements of this type would be appropriate for the evaluation of public health effects of coarse particle exposure. Monitors located in populated areas that are nearly adjacent to large industrial point sources of coarse particles provide suitable locations for assessing maximum population exposure levels and identifying areas of potentially poor air quality. Similarly, monitors located in populated areas that border dense networks of heavily-traveled traffic are appropriate for assessing the impacts of resuspended road dust. This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as school grounds and parks that are nearly adjacent to major roadways and industrial point sources, locations exhibiting mixed residential and commercial development, and downtown areas featuring office buildings, shopping centers, and stadiums.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Neighborhood scale</E>—Measurements in this category would represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface characteristics. This category includes suburban neighborhoods dominated by residences that are somewhat distant from major roadways and industrial districts but still impacted by urban sources, and areas of diverse land use where residences are interspersed with commercial and industrial neighborhoods. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent the immediate neighborhood as well as neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. The comparison of data from middle scale and neighborhood scale sites would provide valuable information for determining the variation of PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> levels across urban areas and assessing the spatial extent of elevated concentrations caused by major industrial point sources and heavily traveled roadways. Neighborhood scale sites would provide concentration data that are relevant to informing a large segment of the population of their exposure levels on a given day.</P>

The alternative location can be outside of the CBSA or outside of the monitoring agencies jurisdiction. In cases where the alternative location crosses jurisdictions the waiver will be contingent on the monitoring agency responsible for the alternative location including the required PAMS measurements in their annual monitoring plan required under § 58.10 and continued successful collection of PAMS measurements at the alternative location.

              <P>(f) The EPA Regional Administrator may grant a waiver from the requirement to collect PAMS measurements in locations where CBSA-wide O<E T="52">3</E> design values are equal to or less than 85% of the 8-hour O<E T="52">3</E> NAAQS and where the location is not considered by the Regional Administrator to be an important upwind or downwind location for other O<E T="52">3</E> nonattainment areas.</P>

The EMP shall be submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator no later than October 1, 2019 or two years following the effective date of a designation to a classification of Moderate or above O<E T="52">3</E> nonattainment, whichever is later. At a minimum, the EMP shall be reassessed and approved as part of the 5-year network assessments required under 40 CFR 58.10(d). The EMP will include monitoring activities deemed important to understanding the O<E T="52">3</E> problems in the state. Such activities may include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>

              <P>(a) This appendix contains specific location criteria applicable to SLAMS, NCore, and PAMS ambient air quality monitoring probes, inlets, and optical paths after the general location has been selected based on the monitoring objectives and spatial scale of representation discussed in appendix D to this part. Adherence to these siting criteria is necessary to ensure the uniform collection of compatible and comparable air quality data.</P>
              <P>(b) The probe and monitoring path siting criteria discussed in this appendix must be followed to the maximum extent possible. It is recognized that there may be situations where some deviation from the siting criteria may be necessary. In any such case, the reasons must be thoroughly documented in a written request for a waiver that describes how and why the proposed siting deviates from the criteria. This documentation should help to avoid later questions about the validity of the resulting monitoring data. Conditions under which the EPA would consider an application for waiver from these siting criteria are discussed in section 10 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(c) The pollutant-specific probe and monitoring path siting criteria generally apply to all spatial scales except where noted otherwise. Specific siting criteria that are phrased with a “must” are defined as requirements and exceptions must be approved through the waiver provisions. However, siting criteria that are phrased with a “should” are defined as goals to meet for consistency but are not requirements.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Horizontal and Vertical Placement</HD>

              <P>The probe or at least 80 percent of the monitoring path must be located between 2 and 15 meters above ground level for all O<E T="52">3</E> and SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring sites, and for neighborhood or larger spatial scale Pb, PM <E T="52">10</E>, PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E>, PM <E T="52">2.5</E>, NO<E T="52">2</E>, and CO sites. Middle scale PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E> sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Microscale Pb, PM <E T="52">10</E>, PM <E T="52">10-2.5</E>, and PM <E T="52">2.5</E> sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Microscale near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. The inlet probes for microscale carbon monoxide monitors that are being used to measure concentrations near roadways must be between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Those inlet probes for microscale carbon monoxide monitors measuring concentrations near roadways in downtown areas or urban street canyons must be between 2.5 and 3.5 meters above ground level. The probe or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be at least 1 meter vertically or horizontally away from any supporting structure, walls, parapets, penthouses, <E T="03">etc.,</E> and away from dusty or dirty areas. If the probe or a significant portion of the monitoring path is located near the side of a building or wall, then it should be located on the windward side of the building relative to the prevailing wind direction during the season of highest concentration potential for the pollutant being measured.<PRTPAGE P="311"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">3. Spacing From Minor Sources</HD>

              <P>(a) It is important to understand the monitoring objective for a particular location in order to interpret this particular requirement. Local minor sources of a primary pollutant, such as SO<E T="52">2</E>, lead, or particles, can cause high concentrations of that particular pollutant at a monitoring site. If the objective for that monitoring site is to investigate these local primary pollutant emissions, then the site is likely to be properly located nearby. This type of monitoring site would in all likelihood be a microscale type of monitoring site. If a monitoring site is to be used to determine air quality over a much larger area, such as a neighborhood or city, a monitoring agency should avoid placing a monitor probe, path, or inlet near local, minor sources. The plume from the local minor sources should not be allowed to inappropriately impact the air quality data collected at a site. Particulate matter sites should not be located in an unpaved area unless there is vegetative ground cover year round, so that the impact of wind blown dusts will be kept to a minimum.</P>

              <P>(b) Similarly, local sources of nitric oxide (NO) and ozone-reactive hydrocarbons can have a scavenging effect causing unrepresentatively low concentrations of O<E T="52">3</E> in the vicinity of probes and monitoring paths for O<E T="52">3</E>. To minimize these potential interferences, the probe or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be away from furnace or incineration flues or other minor sources of SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO. The separation distance should take into account the heights of the flues, type of waste or fuel burned, and the sulfur content of the fuel.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">4. Spacing From Obstructions</HD>

              <P>(a) Buildings and other obstacles may possibly scavenge SO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">3</E>, or NO<E T="52">2</E>, and can act to restrict airflow for any pollutant. To avoid this interference, the probe, inlet, or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must have unrestricted airflow and be located away from obstacles. The distance from the obstacle to the probe, inlet, or monitoring path must be at least twice the height that the obstacle protrudes above the probe, inlet, or monitoring path. An exception to this requirement can be made for measurements taken in street canyons or at source-oriented sites where buildings and other structures are unavoidable.</P>
              <P>(b) Generally, a probe or monitoring path located near or along a vertical wall is undesirable because air moving along the wall may be subject to possible removal mechanisms. A probe, inlet, or monitoring path must have unrestricted airflow in an arc of at least 180 degrees. This arc must include the predominant wind direction for the season of greatest pollutant concentration potential. For particle sampling, a minimum of 2 meters of separation from walls, parapets, and structures is required for rooftop site placement.</P>

              <P>(c) Special consideration must be given to the use of open path analyzers due to their inherent potential sensitivity to certain types of interferences, or optical obstructions. A monitoring path must be clear of all trees, brush, buildings, plumes, dust, or other optical obstructions, including potential obstructions that may move due to wind, human activity, growth of vegetation, etc. Temporary optical obstructions, such as rain, particles, fog, or snow, should be considered when siting an open path analyzer. Any of these temporary obstructions that are of sufficient density to obscure the light beam will affect the ability of the open path analyzer to continuously measure pollutant concentrations. Transient, but significant obscuration of especially longer measurement paths could occur as a result of certain meteorological conditions (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, heavy fog, rain, snow) and/or aerosol levels that are of a sufficient density to prevent the open path analyzer's light transmission. If certain compensating measures are not otherwise implemented at the onset of monitoring (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, shorter path lengths, higher light source intensity), data recovery during periods of greatest primary pollutant potential could be compromised. For instance, if heavy fog or high particulate levels are coincident with periods of projected NAAQS-threatening pollutant potential, the representativeness of the resulting data record in reflecting maximum pollutant concentrations may be substantially impaired despite the fact that the site may otherwise exhibit an acceptable, even exceedingly high overall valid data capture rate.</P>
              <P>(d) For near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring stations, the monitor probe shall have an unobstructed air flow, where no obstacles exist at or above the height of the monitor probe, between the monitor probe and the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">5. Spacing From Trees</HD>
              <P>(a) Trees can provide surfaces for SO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">3</E>, or NO<E T="52">2</E> adsorption or reactions, and surfaces for particle deposition. Trees can also act as obstructions in cases where they are located between the air pollutant sources or source areas and the monitoring site, and where the trees are of a sufficient height and leaf canopy density to interfere with the normal airflow around the probe, inlet, or monitoring path. To reduce this possible interference/obstruction, the probe, inlet, or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be at least 10 meters or further from the drip line of trees.</P>
              <P>(b) The scavenging effect of trees is greater for O<E T="52">3</E> than for other criteria pollutants. <PRTPAGE P="312"/>Monitoring agencies must take steps to consider the impact of trees on ozone monitoring sites and take steps to avoid this problem.</P>
              <P>(c) For microscale sites of any air pollutant, no trees or shrubs should be located between the probe and the source under investigation, such as a roadway or a stationary source.</P>

              <P>6.1 Spacing for Ozone Probes and Monitoring Paths</P>
              <P>In siting an O<E T="52">3</E> analyzer, it is important to minimize destructive interferences form sources of NO, since NO readily reacts with O<E T="52">3</E>. Table E-1 of this appendix provides the required minimum separation distances between a roadway and a probe or, where applicable, at least 90 percent of a monitoring path for various ranges of daily roadway traffic. A sampling site having a point analyzer probe located closer to a roadway than allowed by the Table E-1 requirements should be classified as microscale or middle scale, rather than neighborhood or urban scale, since the measurements from such a site would more closely represent the middle scale. If an open path analyzer is used at a site, the monitoring path(s) must not cross over a roadway with an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day or more. For those situations where a monitoring path crosses a roadway with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day, monitoring agencies must consider the entire segment of the monitoring path in the area of potential atmospheric interference from automobile emissions. Therefore, this calculation must include the length of the monitoring path over the roadway plus any segments of the monitoring path that lie in the area between the roadway and minimum separation distance, as determined from the Table E-1 of this appendix. The sum of these distances must not be greater than 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.</P>
              <P>6.2 Spacing for Carbon Monoxide Probes and Monitoring Paths. (a) Near-road microscale CO monitoring sites, including those located in downtown areas, urban street canyons, and other near-road locations such as those adjacent to highly trafficked roads, are intended to provide a measurement of the influence of the immediate source on the pollution exposure on the adjacent area.</P>
              <P>(b) Microscale CO monitor inlets probes in downtown areas or urban street canyon locations shall be located a minimum distance of 2 meters and a maximum distance of 10 meters from the edge of the nearest traffic lane.</P>
              <P>(c) Microscale CO monitor inlet probes in downtown areas or urban street canyon locations shall be located at least 10 meters from an intersection and preferably at a midblock location. Midblock locations are preferable to intersection locations because intersections represent a much smaller portion of downtown space than do the streets between them. Pedestrian exposure is probably also greater in street canyon/corridors than at intersections.</P>

              <P>6.3 Spacing for Particulate Matter (PM <E T="52">2.5</E>, PM <E T="52">10</E>, Pb) Inlets. (a) Since emissions associated with the operation of motor vehicles contribute to urban area particulate matter ambient levels, spacing from roadway criteria are necessary for ensuring national consistency in PM sampler siting.</P>

              <P>(b) The intent is to locate localized hot-spot sites in areas of highest concentrations whether it be from mobile or multiple stationary sources. If the area is primarily affected by mobile sources and the maximum concentration area(s) is judged to be a traffic corridor or street canyon location, then the monitors should be located near roadways with the highest traffic volume and at separation distances most likely to produce the highest concentrations. For the microscale <PRTPAGE P="313"/>traffic corridor site, the location must be between 5 and 15 meters from the major roadway. For the microscale street canyon site the location must be between 2 and 10 meters from the roadway. For the middle scale site, a range of acceptable distances from the roadway is shown in figure E-1 of this appendix. This figure also includes separation distances between a roadway and neighborhood or larger scale sites by default. Any site, 2 to 15 meters high, and further back than the middle scale requirements will generally be neighborhood, urban or regional scale. For example, according to Figure E-1 of this appendix, if a PM sampler is primarily influenced by roadway emissions and that sampler is set back 10 meters from a 30,000 ADT (average daily traffic) road, the site should be classified as microscale, if the sampler height is between 2 and 7 meters. If the sampler height is between 7 and 15 meters, the site should be classified as middle scale. If the sample is 20 meters from the same road, it will be classified as middle scale; if 40 meters, neighborhood scale; and if 110 meters, an urban scale.</P>
              <P>6.4 Spacing for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<E T="52">2</E>) Probes and Monitoring Paths.</P>
              <P>(a) In siting near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitors as required in paragraph 4.3.2 of appendix D of this part, the monitor probe shall be as near as practicable to the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment; but shall not be located at a distance greater than 50 meters, in the horizontal, from the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment.</P>
              <P>(b) In siting NO<E T="52">2</E> monitors for neighborhood and larger scale monitoring, it is important to minimize near-road influences. Table E-1 of this appendix provides the required minimum separation distances between a roadway and a probe or, where applicable, at least 90 percent of a monitoring path for various ranges of daily roadway traffic. A sampling site having a point analyzer probe located closer to a roadway than allowed by the Table E-1 requirements should be classified as microscale or middle scale rather than neighborhood or urban scale. If an open path analyzer is used at a site, the monitoring path(s) must not cross over a roadway with an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day or more. For those situations where a monitoring path crosses a roadway with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day, monitoring agencies must consider the entire segment of the monitoring path in the area of potential atmospheric interference form automobile emissions. Therefore, this calculation must include the length of the monitoring path over the roadway plus any segments of the monitoring path that lie in the area between the roadway and minimum separation distance, as determined form the Table E-1 of this appendix. The sum of these distances must not be greater than 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">7. Cumulative Interferences on a Monitoring Path</HD>
              <P>(This paragraph applies only to open path analyzers.) The cumulative length or portion of a monitoring path that is affected by minor sources, trees, or roadways must not exceed 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">8. Maximum Monitoring Path Length</HD>
              <P>(This paragraph applies only to open path analyzers.) The monitoring path length must not exceed 1 kilometer for analyzers in neighborhood, urban, or regional scale. For middle scale monitoring sites, the monitoring path length must not exceed 300 meters. In areas subject to frequent periods of dust, fog, rain, or snow, consideration should be given to a shortened monitoring path length to minimize loss of monitoring data due to these temporary optical obstructions. For certain ambient air monitoring scenarios using open path analyzers, shorter path lengths may be needed in order to ensure that the monitoring site meets the objectives and spatial scales defined in appendix D to this part. The Regional Administrator may require shorter path lengths, as needed on an individual basis, to ensure that the SLAMS sites meet the appendix D requirements. Likewise, the Administrator may specify the maximum path length used at NCore monitoring sites.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">9. Probe Material and Pollutant Sample Residence Time</HD>
              <P>(a) For the reactive gases, SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">2</E>, and O<E T="52">3</E>, special probe material must be used for point analyzers. Studies <E T="51">20-24</E> have been conducted to determine the suitability of materials such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, Tygon ®, aluminum, brass, stainless steel, copper, Pyrex ® glass and Teflon ® for use as intake sampling lines. Of the above materials, only Pyrex ® glass and Teflon ® have been found to be acceptable for use as intake sampling lines for all the reactive gaseous pollutants. Furthermore, the EPA <SU>25</SU> has specified borosilicate glass or FEP Teflon ® as the only acceptable probe materials for delivering test atmospheres in the determination of reference or equivalent methods. Therefore, borosilicate glass, FEP Teflon ® or their equivalent must be the only material in the sampling train (from inlet probe to the back of the analyzer) that can be in contact with the ambient air sample for existing and new SLAMs.</P>
              <P>(b) For volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring at PAMS, FEP Teflon ® is unacceptable as the probe material because of VOC adsorption and desorption reactions on the FEP Teflon ®. Borosilicate glass, stainless steel, or its equivalent are the acceptable probe materials for VOC and carbonyl sampling. Care must be taken to ensure that the sample residence time is kept to 20 seconds or less.</P>

              <P>(c) No matter how nonreactive the sampling probe material is initially, after a period of use reactive particulate matter is deposited on the probe walls. Therefore, the time it takes the gas to transfer from the probe inlet to the sampling device is also critical. Ozone in the presence of nitrogen oxide (NO) will show significant losses even in the most inert probe material when the residence time exceeds 20 seconds. <SU>26</SU> Other studies <SU>27 28</SU> indicate that a 10 second or less residence time is easily achievable. Therefore, sampling probes for reactive gas monitors at NCore and at NO<E T="52">2</E> sites must have a sample residence time less than 20 seconds.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">10. Waiver Provisions</HD>
              <P>Most sampling probes or monitors can be located so that they meet the requirements of this appendix. New sites with rare exceptions, can be located within the limits of this appendix. However, some existing sites may not meet these requirements and still produce useful data for some purposes. The EPA will consider a written request from the State agency to waive one or more siting criteria for some monitoring sites providing that the State can adequately demonstrate the need (purpose) for monitoring or establishing a monitoring site at that location.</P>
              <P>10.1 For establishing a new site, a waiver may be granted only if both of the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>10.1.1 The site can be demonstrated to be as representative of the monitoring area as it would be if the siting criteria were being met.</P>
              <P>10.1.2 The monitor or probe cannot reasonably be located so as to meet the siting criteria because of physical constraints (e.g., inability to locate the required type of site the necessary distance from roadways or obstructions).</P>
              <P>10.2 However, for an existing site, a waiver may be granted if either of the criteria in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of this appendix are met.</P>
              <P>10.3 Cost benefits, historical trends, and other factors may be used to add support to the criteria in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of this appendix, however, they in themselves, will not be acceptable reasons for granting a waiver. Written requests for waivers must be submitted to the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">11. Summary</HD>

              <P>Table E-4 of this appendix presents a summary of the general requirements for probe and monitoring path siting criteria with respect to distances and heights. It is apparent from Table E-4 that different elevation distances above the ground are shown for the <PRTPAGE P="315"/>various pollutants. The discussion in this appendix for each of the pollutants describes reasons for elevating the monitor, probe, or monitoring path. The differences in the specified range of heights are based on the vertical concentration gradients. For CO and near-road NO<E T="52">2</E> monitors, the gradients in the vertical direction are very large for the microscale, so a small range of heights are used. The upper limit of 15 meters is specified for the consistency between pollutants and to allow the use of a single manifold or monitoring path for monitoring more than one pollutant.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. What Is the AQI?</HD>

              <P>The AQI is a tool that simplifies reporting air quality to the general public. The AQI incorporates into a single index concentrations of 5 criteria pollutants: ozone (O<E T="52">3</E>), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<E T="52">2</E>). The scale of the index is divided into general categories that are associated with health messages.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Why Report the AQI?</HD>
              <P>The AQI offers various advantages:</P>
              <P>a. It is simple to create and understand.</P>
              <P>b. It conveys the health implications of air quality.</P>
              <P>c. It promotes uniform use throughout the country.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Must I Report the AQI?</HD>
              <P>You must report the AQI daily if yours is a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population over 350,000.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. What Goes Into My AQI Report?</HD>
              <P>i. Your AQI report must contain the following:</P>
              <P>a. The reporting area(s) (the MSA or subdivision of the MSA).</P>
              <P>b. The reporting period (the day for which the AQI is reported).</P>
              <P>c. The critical pollutant (the pollutant with the highest index value).</P>
              <P>d. The AQI (the highest index value).</P>

              <P>e. The category descriptor and index value associated with the AQI and, if you choose to report in a color format, the associated color. Use only the following descriptors and colors for the six AQI categories:<PRTPAGE P="318"/>

              <P>ii. When appropriate, your AQI report may also contain the following:</P>
              <P>a. Appropriate health and cautionary statements.</P>
              <P>b. The name and index value for other pollutants, particularly those with an index value greater than 100.</P>
              <P>c. The index values for sub-areas of your MSA.</P>
              <P>d. Causes for unusual AQI values.</P>
              <P>e. Actual pollutant concentrations.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Is My AQI Report for My MSA Only?</HD>

              <P>Generally, your AQI report applies to your MSA only. However, if a significant air quality problem exists (AQI greater than 100) in areas significantly impacted by your MSA but not in it (for example, O<E T="52">3</E> concentrations are often highest downwind and outside an urban area), you should identify these areas and report the AQI for these areas as well.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. How Do I Get My AQI Report to the Public?</HD>
              <P>You must furnish the daily report to the appropriate news media (radio, television, and newspapers). You must make the daily report publicly available at one or more places of public access, or by any other means, including a recorded phone message, a public Internet site, or facsimile transmission. When the AQI value is greater than 100, it is particularly critical that the reporting to the various news media be as extensive as possible. At a minimum, it should include notification to the media with the largest market coverages for the area in question.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">7. How Often Must I Report the AQI?</HD>
              <P>You must report the AQI at least 5 days per week. Exceptions to this requirement are in section 8 of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">8. May I Make Exceptions to These Reporting Requirements?</HD>
              <P>i. If the index value for a particular pollutant remains below 50 for a season or year, then you may exclude the pollutant from your calculation of the AQI in section 12.</P>
              <P>ii. If all index values remain below 50 for a year, then you may report the AQI at your discretion. In subsequent years, if pollutant levels rise to where the AQI would be above 50, then the AQI must be reported as required in sections 3, 4, 6, and 7 of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Calculation</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9. How does the AQI relate to air pollution levels?</HD>

              <P>For each pollutant, the AQI transforms ambient concentrations to a scale from 0 to 500. The AQI is keyed as appropriate to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for each pollutant. In most cases, the index value of 100 is associated with the numerical level of the short-term standard (i.e., averaging time of 24-hours or less) for each pollutant. The index value of 50 is associated with the numerical level of the annual standard for a pollutant, if there is one, at one-half the level of the short-term standard for the pollutant, or at the level at which it is appropriate to begin to provide guidance on cautionary language. Higher categories of the index are based on increasingly serious health effects and increasing proportions of the population that are likely to be affected. The index is related to other air pollution concentrations through linear interpolation based on these levels. The AQI is equal to the highest of the numbers corresponding to each pollutant. For the purposes of reporting the AQI, the sub-indexes for PM <E T="52">10</E> and PM <E T="52">2.5</E> are to be considered separately. The pollutant responsible for the highest index value (the reported AQI) is called the “critical” pollutant.<PRTPAGE P="319"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">10. What monitors should I use to get the pollutant concentrations for calculating the AQI?</HD>

              <P>You must use concentration data from State/Local Air Monitoring Station (SLAMS) or parts of the SLAMS required by 40 CFR 58.10 for each pollutant except PM. For PM, calculate and report the AQI on days for which you have measured air quality data (e.g., from continuous PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitors required in Appendix D to this part). You may use PM measurements from monitors that are not reference or equivalent methods (for example, continuous PM <E T="52">10</E> or PM <E T="52">2.5</E> monitors). Detailed guidance for relating non-approved measurements to approved methods by statistical linear regression is referenced in section 13 below.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">11. Do I Have to Forecast the AQI?</HD>
              <P>You should forecast the AQI to provide timely air quality information to the public, but this is not required. If you choose to forecast the AQI, then you may consider both long-term and short-term forecasts. You can forecast the AQI at least 24-hours in advance using the most accurate and reasonable procedures considering meteorology, topography, availability of data, and forecasting expertise. The document “Guideline for Developing an Ozone Forecasting Program” (the Forecasting Guidance) will help you start a forecasting program. You can also issue short-term forecasts by predicting 8-hour ozone values from 1-hour ozone values using methods suggested in the Reporting Guidance, “Guideline for Public Reporting of Daily Air Quality.”</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">12. How do I calculate the AQI?</HD>
              <P>i. The AQI is the highest value calculated for each pollutant as follows:</P>

              <P>a. Identify the highest concentration among all of the monitors within each reporting area and truncate as follows:

                  <SU>1</SU> Areas are generally required to report the AQI based on 8-hour ozone values. However, there are a small number of areas where an AQI based on 1-hour ozone values would be more precautionary. In these cases, in addition to calculating the 8-hour ozone index value, the 1-hour ozone index value may be calculated, and the maximum of the two values reported.</TNOTE>

              <P>ii. If the concentration is equal to a breakpoint, then the index is equal to the corresponding index value in Table 2. However, Equation 1 can still be used. The results will be equal. If the concentration is between two breakpoints, then calculate the index of that pollutant with Equation 1. You must also note that in some areas, the AQI based on 1-hour O<E T="52">3</E> will be more precautionary than using 8-hour values (see footnote 1 to Table 2). In these cases, you may use 1-hour values as well as 8-hour values to calculate index values and then use the maximum index value as the AQI for O<E T="52">3</E>.</P>

              <P>The EPA has developed a computer program to calculate the AQI for you. The program prompts for inputs, and it displays all the pertinent information for the AQI (the index value, color, category, sensitive group, health effects, and cautionary language). The EPA has also prepared a brochure on the AQI that explains the index in detail (The Air Quality Index), Reporting Guidance (Technical Assistance Document for the Reporting of Daily Air Quality—the Air Quality Index (AQI)) that provides associated health effects and cautionary statements, and Forecasting Guidance (Guideline for Developing an Ozone Forecasting Program) that explains the steps necessary to start an air pollution forecasting program.

              <P>(b) To determine the composition of a coating in order to perform the calculations in paragraph (a) of this section, the reference method for VOC content is Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. To determine the VOC content of a coating, the regulated entity may use Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, an alternative method as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, or any other reasonable means for predicting that the coating has been formulated as intended (e.g., quality assurance checks, recordkeeping). However, if there are any inconsistencies between the results of a Method 24 test and any other means for determining VOC content, the Method 24 test results will govern. The Administrator may require the regulated to conduct a Method 24 analysis.<PRTPAGE P="326"/>

              <P>(c) If a regulated entity recommends that its coating component(s) be combined with coating components of another regulated entity, and if the coating resulting from such a combination does not comply with the VOC content limit in § 59.102 (a) of this subpart, then the former regulated entity is out of compliance, unless the entity submits Method 24 data to the Administrator demonstrating that its recommended combination of coating components meets the VOC content limit in § 59.102(a). If the latter regulated entity does not make the recommendation of such use of the coating components, then that entity is not out of compliance for purposes of that resulting coating.</P>
              <P>(d) Pretreatment wash primers: Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the acid weight percent of pretreatment wash primers must be determined using the American Society for Testing and Materials Test Method D 1613-96 (incorporated by reference in § 59.110). If the pigment in a pretreatment wash primer prevents the use of this test method for determining the acid weight percent of the coating, then the test method shall be used for the nonpigmented component of the coating, and the acid weight percent shall be calculated based on the acid content of the nonpigmented component and the mixing ratio of the nonpigmented component to the remaining components recommended by the regulated entity.</P>
              <P>(e) Low-gloss coatings: Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the gloss reading of low-gloss coatings must be determined using the American Society for Testing and Materials Test Method D 523-89 (incorporated by reference in § 59.110).</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may approve, on a case-by-case basis, a regulated entity's use of an alternative method in lieu of Method 24 for determining the VOC content of coatings if the alternative method is demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to provide results that are acceptable for purposes of determining compliance with this subpart.</P>

Conduct a full velocity traverse using the stack velocity measurement device as shown in figure 3 of this Appendix A to this Subpart, or use Method 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Continuously record a velocity reference point reading during each test run using a chart recorder or once every 20 seconds if using Method 1A. Calculate the volumetric flow rate using the gas velocity, moisture content, and the stack cross-sectional area. For the purposes of this protocol, the static pressure shall be assumed to be atmospheric, the molar density correction factor in the stack to be 1.0, and the moisture content to be 2 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) Integrated VOC sample. Collect integrated VOC gas samples at the sampling port in the exhaust stack using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 25 Total Combustion Analysis (TCA) sampling apparatus consisting of two evacuated 9-liter tanks, each equipped with flow controllers, vacuum gauges, and probes, as shown in figure 4 of Appendix A of this Subpart. Use 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 25, SCAQMD Method 25.1 (incorporated by reference—§ 59.213 of this subpart), or equivalent, for analysis. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and non-methane organic carbon are analyzed by the TCA and TCA/Flame Ionization Detector (FID) methods. Oxygen content is determined by gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector. Clean particulate filters between use by heating to 760 degrees Celsius (1400 degrees Fahrenheit) while using compressed air as a carrier for cleaning and purging.</P>

A continuous organic emissions monitor which uses a continuous FID shall be used for each test run to measure the real time organic concentration of the exhaust as methane. Record the emission monitor response in parts per million continuously during the sampling period using a chart recorder or at least once every 10 seconds. The VOC analyzer shall be operated as prescribed in the manufacturer's directions unless otherwise noted in this protocol.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Pretest procedure.</E> (1) Charcoal lighter material—charcoal. Before each test run, remove charcoal from a sealed bag that has been stored for at least 72 hours in a humidity and temperature controlled room which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section and weight out 0.9 kilograms (2 pounds) of charcoal briquettes, to the nearest whole briquette over 0.9 kilograms (2 pounds), of uniform shape with no broken pieces using an analytical balance. Reseal the bag. Charcoal must be ignited within 10 minutes after removal from bag. A sealed or resealed bag of charcoal cannot be stored at the test site for greater than 45 minutes. It must be returned to a humidity and temperature controlled room from 72 hours. The lighter material must be purchased, stored, weighed, and handled the same as the barbecue charcoal.</P>
              <P>(i) For the reference VOC emission tests using an electric probe, place a single layer of charcoal, slightly larger than the area/circle of the electric probe heating element, onto the grate. Place the heating element on top of this first layer and cover the heating element with the remaining charcoal briquettes.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the ignition VOC emissions tests, arrange the briquettes on the barbecue grate in the manner specified by the ignition manufacturer's directions. If these manufacturer's directions do not specify a stacking arrangement for the briquettes, randomly stack the briquettes in a pile using the stacking ring described in paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Charcoal lighter material—or impregnated charcoal. Store, handle, weigh, and stack barbecue charcoal that is designed to be lit without the packaging, the same as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. For those products which require both the package <PRTPAGE P="342"/>and charcoal be lit, weigh the whole package—do not remove charcoal. Weigh an empty package (not the same one to be used during the test). Subtract the package weight from the overall weight of the package and charcoal. The full package and empty package must be stored, handled, and weighed the same as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the difference (the charcoal weight) is between 0.7 to 1.4 kilograms (1.5 to 3.0 pounds), the test may proceed. The emissions measured (E) in Equation 5 of paragraph (k)(7) of this section must be adjusted to a 0.9 kilogram (2-pound) charge. Place packaged barbecue charcoal on the grate in the manner specified by the manufacturer's directions.</P>
              <P>(3) Initial meteorological and environmental criteria in paragraph (d) shall be complied with.</P>
              <P>(4) The stack velocity must be set before each day of testing at 140 ±9 meters per minute (450 ±30 feet per minute) by performing a velocity traverse as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The velocity will be attained by adjusting the axial fan speed using a rheostat.</P>
              <P>(5) The fireplace shall be conditioned at the start of each day before sampling tests by using a grill ignited by the electric probe. If a time period of over 60 minutes between sampling test runs occur, the condition step must be repeated.</P>
              <P>(6) Before each test run, leak check the continuous organic emissions monitor by blocking the flow to the probe. Allow the instrument to warm up for the duration specified by the manufacturer's directions. Select the 0 to 100 parts per million range. Check the battery level and hydrogen pressure. Zero with hydrocarbon-free air (&lt;0.1 parts per million hydrocarbons as methane) span with 90 parts per million methane in ultra pure air. Zero and span another instrument selection range if needed for test purposes.</P>
              <P>(7) Before the testing program begins, establish a point of average concentration of organics in the stack by using a continuous organic emissions monitor and a grill with charcoal ignited by the electric probe 40 minutes after initial release of emissions. Record the continuous organic emissions monitor traverse data.</P>
              <P>(8) Prepare the integrated VOC sampling equipment and perform the required leak checks. Fit the probes with nozzles housing two micron particulate filters. Insert the probes and nozzles into the sampling port to draw a sample of the exhaust gas from the point of average organic concentration as determined from the continuous organic emissions monitor sample traverse described in paragraph (h)(4) of this section. Also, position the nozzles such that they point downstream in the stack. Obtain the samples concurrently and continuously over the test run.</P>
              <P>(9) Insert the continuous organic emissions monitor probe into the sampling port to draw a sample of the exhaust gas from the point of average organic concentration as determined from the continuous organic emissions monitor sample traverse described in paragraph (h)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> The labeled directions, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, shall be followed throughout the course of the testing. In cases where the directions are incompatible with this protocol, circumvent the intent of this protocol, or are unclear (subject to different interpretations) and inadequate, the Administrator must be informed in writing of the nature of the conflict, as well as the proposed resolution, prior to commencing testing. When the labeled directions for a charcoal lighter material do not fall within the testing guidelines of this protocol, the protocol may only be modified upon written approval of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(1) Place the bottom of the barbecue grill on the floor of the fireplace, 5 centimeters (2 inches) from the rear wall. Ignite charcoal as specified by manufacturer's labeled directions.</P>
              <P>(2) For electric probe ignition, carefully remove probe without disturbing charcoal after 10 minutes of operation.</P>
              <P>(3) For fluid ignition, simultaneously match light fluid on charcoal and fluid that has fallen to the bottom of the grill.</P>

              <P>(4) Place the grill temperature probe 11 centimeters (4.5 inches) above the top of the charcoal immediately after the charcoal lighter material flame <PRTPAGE P="343"/>goes out, or before, if the lighter material does not flame.</P>
              <P>(5) Conduct at least six test runs for both the electric probe ignition and for the lighter material being evaluated. Alternate these lighter material for all 12 runs. All runs must be conducted over 3 consecutive days or less. Alternatively, baseline emissions testing (using the electric probe) may be applied to other test runs provided the test runs occur within 4 months of the baseline testing. Integrated VOC sampling and continuous organic emissions monitoring begin for each test run when the charcoal lighter material and/or materials start to generate/release organics (this will be the time of pouring for lighter fluids and the time of ignition for most other ignition sources). Option: Because the manufacturer of treated or impregnated charcoal supplies both the lighter material and barbecue charcoal, they may apply the 9 grams VOC per start emission limit as an absolute value without an adjustment for the VOC emissions from an electric probe.</P>
              <P>(6) Sampling ends for each test run when all the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The temperature 11 centimeters (4.5 inches) above the maximum height of the briquette pile, using the grill temperature probe described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, is at least 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit);</P>
              <P>(ii) The continuous organic emissions monitor is reading below 30 parts per million for at least 2 minutes;</P>
              <P>(iii) The test sampling has continued for 25 minutes (but not more) and</P>
              <P>(iv) The charcoal surface is 70 percent covered with ash (to be documented with photograph on top and 60 degrees above the horizon).</P>
              <P>(7) During the sampling test runs, temperatures (excluding ambient) and continuous organic emission monitor readings shall be recorded and shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. Humidity, wind speed, and ambient temperature readings shall be monitored and shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) Collect one blank sample for VOC and one ambient air sample during one run of each day per paragraph (k) of this section.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Post-run procedure.</E> (1) Record temperatures (including ambient), humidity, wind speed, and continuous organic emissions monitor reading.</P>
              <P>(2) Record the drift using zero and span gases. Leak check and span the continuous organic emissions monitor as described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section for the next run.</P>
              <P>(3) Leak check and disassemble the integrated VOC sampling equipment as described in Method 25 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or SCAQMD Method 25.1 (incorporated by reference—see § 59.213 of this subpart), or equivalent.</P>
              <P>(4) Thoroughly clean grill surfaces of all residue before conducting next ignition run.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Calculations.</E> Calculations shall be carried out to at least one significant digit beyond that of the acquired data, and then rounded off after final calculation to two significant digits for each run. All rounding off of numbers should be in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 380-93, Standard Practice for Use of the SI International System of Units, procedures (incorporated by reference—see § 59.213 of this subpart).</P>

              <P>(b) To determine the composition of a coating in order to perform the calculations in paragraph (a) of this section, the reference method for VOC content is Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. To determine the VOC content of a coating, the manufacturer or importer may use Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, an alternative method as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, formulation data, or any other reasonable means for predicting that the coating has been formulated as intended (e.g., quality assurance checks, recordkeeping). However, if there are any inconsistencies between the results of a Method 24 test and any other means for determining VOC content, the Method 24 test results will govern, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The Administrator may <PRTPAGE P="364"/>require the manufacturer or importer to conduct a Method 24 analysis.</P>
              <P>(c) The Administrator may approve, on a case-by-case basis, a manufacturer's or importer's use of an alternative method in lieu of Method 24 for determining the VOC content of coatings if the alternative method is demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to provide results that are acceptable for purposes of determining compliance with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) Analysis of methacrylate multicomponent coatings used as traffic marking coatings shall be conducted according to the procedures specified in appendix A to this subpart. Appendix A to this subpart is a modification of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. The modification of Method 24 provided in appendix A to this subpart has not been approved for methacrylate multicomponent coatings used for other purposes than as traffic marking coatings or for other classes of multicomponent coatings.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator may determine a manufacturer's or importer's compliance with the provisions of this subpart based on information required by this subpart (including the records and reports required by §§ 59.407 and 59.408 of this subpart) or any other information available to the Administrator.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 59—Determination of Volatile Matter Content of Methacrylate Multicomponent Coatings Used as Traffic Marking Coatings</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">1.0 Principle and Applicability</HD>

              <P>1.1 Applicability. This modification to Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 applies to the determination of volatile matter content of methacrylate multicomponent coatings used as traffic marking coatings.<PRTPAGE P="368"/>
              </P>
              <P>1.2 Principle. A known amount of methacrylate multicomponent coating is dispersed in a weighing dish using a stirring device before the volatile matter is removed by heating in an oven.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2.0 Procedure</HD>
              <P>2.1 Prepare about 100 milliliters (mL) of sample by mixing the components in a storage container, such as a glass jar with a screw top or a metal can with a cap. The storage container should be just large enough to hold the mixture. Combine the components (by weight or volume) in the ratio recommended by the manufacturer. Tightly close the container between additions and during mixing to prevent loss of volatile materials. Most manufacturers' mixing instructions are by volume. Because of possible error caused by expansion of the liquid when measuring the volume, it is recommended that the components be combined by weight. When weight is used to combine the components and the manufacturer's recommended ratio is by volume, the density must be determined by section 3.5 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.</P>
              <P>2.2 Immediately after mixing, take aliquots from this 100 mL sample for determination of the total volatile content, water content, and density. To determine water content, follow section 3.4 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. To determine density, follow section 3.5 of Method 24. To determine total volatile content, use the apparatus and reagents described in section 3.8.2 of Method 24 and the following procedures:</P>
              <P>2.2.1 Weigh and record the weight of an aluminum foil weighing dish and a metal paper clip. Using a syringe as specified in section 3.8.2.1 of Method 24, weigh to 1 milligrams (mg), by difference, a sample of coating into the weighing dish. For methacrylate multicomponent coatings used for traffic marking use 3.0 ±0.1 g.</P>
              <P>2.2.2 Add the specimen and use the metal paper clip to disperse the specimen over the surface of the weighing dish. If the material forms a lump that cannot be dispersed, discard the specimen and prepare a new one. Similarly, prepare a duplicate. The sample shall stand for a minimum of 1 hour, but no more than 24 hours before being oven dried at 110 ±5 degrees Celsius for 1 hour.</P>
              <P>2.2.3 Heat the aluminum foil dishes containing the dispersed specimens in the forced draft oven for 60 minutes at 110 ±5 degrees Celsius. Caution—provide adequate ventilation, consistent with accepted laboratory practice, to prevent solvent vapors from accumulating to a dangerous level.</P>
              <P>2.2.4 Remove the dishes from the oven, place immediately in a desiccator, cool to ambient temperature, and weigh to within 1 mg. After weighing, break up the film of the coating using the metal paper clip. Weigh dish to within 1 mg. Return to forced draft oven for an additional 60 minutes at 110 ±5 degrees Celsius.</P>
              <P>2.2.5 Remove the dishes from the oven, place immediately in a desiccator, cool to ambient temperature, and weigh to within 1 mg.</P>
              <P>2.2.6 Run analyses in pairs (duplicate sets for each coating mixture until the criterion in section 4.3 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 is met. Calculate the weight of volatile matter for each heating period following Equation 24-2 of Method 24 and record the arithmetic average. Add the arithmetic average for the two heating periods to obtain the weight fraction of the volatile matter.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">3.0 Data Validation Procedure</HD>
              <P>3.1 Follow the procedures in Section 4 of Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.</P>
              <P>3.2 If more than 10 percent of the sample is lost when the sample is being broken up in 2.2.4, the sample is invalid.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">4.0 Calculations</HD>
              <P>Follow the calculation procedures in Section 5 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.</P>

              <P>(f) If you are a person who manufactures or processes aerosol coatings outside of the United States, you may qualify for the small quantity manufacturer exemption in paragraph (e) of this section if you meet the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The total VOC by mass included in all aerosol coatings you manufacture, at all facilities, in a given calendar year, in the aggregate, is less than 7,500 kilograms.</P>
              <P>(2) You comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in §§ 59.510 and 59.511.</P>
              <P>(3) You commit to and comply with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(vii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) You must submit an initial notification no later than July 31, 2009, or on <PRTPAGE P="371"/>or before the date that you start manufacturing aerosol coating products that are sold in the United States, whichever is later. This initial notification must state that you are a foreign manufacturer that is intending to qualify for the small quantity manufacturer exemption in paragraph (e) of this section, provide all of the information specified in § 59.511(b), and provide all the information in paragraphs (f)(3)(i)(A) and (f)(3)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) The name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address of an agent located in the United States who will serve as your point of contact for communications with EPA.</P>
              <P>(B) The address of each of your facilities that is manufacturing aerosol coatings for sale in the United States.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must notify the Administrator of any changes in the information provided in your initial notification within 30 days following the change.</P>
              <P>(iii) The agent identified above must maintain a copy of the compliance records specified in § 59.510(b). Those records must be kept by the agent such that the agent will be able to provide the written report which must be submitted upon 60 days notice under § 59.511(d) and able to make those records available for inspection and review under § 59.511(e).</P>
              <P>(iv) You must give any EPA inspector or auditor full, complete, and immediate access to your facilities and records to conduct inspections and audits of your manufacturing facilities.</P>
              <P>(v) You must agree that United States substantive and procedural law shall apply to any civil or criminal enforcement action against you under this subpart, and that the forum for any civil or criminal enforcement action under this subpart shall be governed by the CAA, including the EPA administrative forum where allowed under the CAA.</P>

              <P>(d) If you manufacture a coating containing either an aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent mixture, you must use the appropriate RF for that mixture provided in Table 2B or 2C of this subpart when calculating the PWR using formulation data. However, when calculating the PWR for a coating containing these mixtures using data from California Air Resources Board Method 310 (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in 59.515), or EPA Method 311—Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), you must identify the individual compounds that are present in the solvent mixture and use the weight fraction of those individual compounds and their RF from Table 2A of this subpart in the calculation.</P>
              <P>(e) If a VOC is used in a product but not listed in Table 2A of this subpart, the Reactivity Factor (RF) is assigned according to paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3) or (e)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) If the VOC is not listed in Table 2A of this subpart, but has an RF greater than 0.3, the regulated entity may petition EPA to add the VOC to Table 2A, as described in § 59.511(j). Based on these petitions, EPA will periodically update the appropriate table. Once an RF for a VOC is listed on the appropriate table, that RF will be used for that VOC for the purposes of this rule. As provided in § 59.511(j), any petitions submitted to EPA on or before June 1, 2008, will be considered, and if appropriate, incorporated into Table 2A on or before January 1, 2009.</P>
              <P>(2) If the VOC is used in a product but not listed in Table 2A of this regulation, and has an RF less than or equal to 0.3, and will be used at a level greater than or equal to 7.3 weight percent (g of compound/g product) in any of the regulated entity's formulations, the regulated entity may petition EPA as described in § 59.511(j). Based on these petitions, EPA will periodically update the appropriate table. Once an RF for a VOC is listed on the appropriate table, that RF will be used for that VOC for the purposes of this rule. As provided in § 59.511(j), any petition submitted to EPA on or before June 1, 2008 will be considered, and if appropriate, incorporated into Table 2A on or before January 1, 2009.</P>
              <P>(3) If a compound has an RF less than or equal to 0.3, and will not be used at a level greater than or equal to 7.3 weight percent (g of compound/g product) in any of the regulated entity's formulations, the RF to be used in all calculations by that entity for this subpart is 0.</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, if a VOC is not listed in Table 2A of this subpart, it is assigned a default RF factor of 22.04 g O3/g VOC. As described in § 59.511(j), regulated entities may petition the Administrator to add a compound or mixture to Table 2A, 2B, or 2C of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f) In calculating the PWR value for a coating containing an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent with a boiling range different from the ranges specified in Table 2C of this subpart, you must assign an RF as described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) If the solvent boiling point is lower than or equal to 420 degrees F, then you must use the RF in Table 2C of this subpart specified for bin 23;</P>
              <P>(2) If the solvent boiling point is higher than 420 degrees F, then you must use the RF specified in Table 2C of this subpart for bin 24.</P>
              <P>(g) For purposes of compliance with the PWR limits, all compounds listed in Tables 2A, 2B, or 2C that are used in the aerosol coating products must be included in the calculation. This includes compounds that may otherwise be exempted from the definition of VOC in § 59.100(s).</P>

                <SUBJECT>How must manufacturers apply good engineering judgment?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) In addition to other requirements and prohibitions set forth in this subpart, you must use good engineering judgment for decisions related to any requirements under this subpart. This includes your applications for certification, any testing you do to show that your portable fuel containers comply with requirements that apply to them, and how you select, categorize, determine, and apply these requirements.</P>

                <P>(b) Upon request, you must provide EPA a written description of the engineering judgment in question. Such information must be provided within 15 working days unless EPA specifies a different period of time to respond.<PRTPAGE P="390"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) We may reject your decision if it is not based on good engineering judgment or is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements that apply, and we may—</P>
                <P>(1) Suspend, revoke, or void a certificate of conformity if we determine you used incorrect or incomplete information or failed to consider relevant information, or that your decision was not based on good engineering judgment; or</P>
                <P>(2) Notify you that we believe any aspect of your application or other information submission may be incorrect or invalid due to lack of good engineering judgment or other cause. Unless a different period is specified, you will have 30 days to respond to our notice and specifically address our concerns. After considering your information, we will notify you regarding our finding, which may include the actions provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) If you disagree with our conclusions under paragraph (c) of this section, you may file a request for a hearing with the Designated Compliance Officer as described in § 59.699. In your request, you must specifically state your objections, and include relevant data or supporting analysis. The request must be signed by your authorized representative. If we agree that your request raises a substantial factual issue, we will hold the hearing according to § 59.699.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What evaporative emission requirements apply under this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Hydrocarbon emissions from portable fuel containers may not exceed 0.3 grams per gallon per day when measured with the test procedures in §§ 59.650 through 59.653. This procedure measures diurnal venting emissions and permeation emissions.</P>
                <P>(b) For the purpose of this section, portable fuel containers include spouts, caps, gaskets, and other parts provided with the container.</P>
                <P>(c) The following general requirements also apply for all portable fuel containers subject to the standards of this subpart:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Prohibited controls.</E> The following controls are prohibited:<PRTPAGE P="391"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control systems so they cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating.</P>

                <P>(ii) For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control systems with features that disable, deactivate, reduce effectiveness, or bypass the emission controls, either actively or passively. However, you may include a vent that the operator can open to bypass emission controls if that vent closes automatically (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> without operator involvement). You may include such design features if they operate during emission tests described in subpart F of this part. For example, you may include an integrated or external manually activated device in the portable fuel container's design to temporarily relieve pressure, provided that the device is in place during emission testing and closes automatically when not in use.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Leaks.</E> You must design and manufacture your containers to be free of leaks. This requirement applies when your container is upright, partially inverted, or completely inverted.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Refueling.</E> You are required to design your portable fuel containers to minimize spillage during refueling to the extent practical. This requires that you use good engineering judgment to avoid designs that will make it difficult to refuel typical vehicle and equipment designs without spillage.</P>
                <P>(d) Portable fuel containers must meet the standards and requirements specified in this subpart throughout the useful life of the container. The useful life of the container is five years beginning on the date of sale to the ultimate purchaser.</P>

                <P>(a) You must amend your application before you take either of the following actions:</P>
                <P>(1) Add a configuration to an emission family. In this case, the configuration added must be consistent with other configurations in the emission family with respect to the criteria listed in § 59.625.</P>
                <P>(2) Change a configuration already included in an emission family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the components you described in your application for certification. This includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any time during the portable fuel containers' lifetime.</P>
                <P>(b) To amend your application for certification, send the Designated Compliance Officer the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) Describe in detail the addition or change in the configuration you intend to make.</P>
                <P>(2) Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended emission family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this by showing that the original emission data are still appropriate with respect to showing compliance of the amended family with all applicable requirements.</P>

                <P>(3) If the original emission data for the emission family are not appropriate to show compliance for the new <PRTPAGE P="394"/>or modified configuration, include new test data showing that the new or modified configuration meets the requirements of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You must give us these within 30 days after we request them.</P>
                <P>(d) For emission families already covered by a certificate of conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of conformity covers your new or modified configuration. You may ask for a hearing if we deny your request (see § 59.699).</P>
                <P>(e) For emission families already covered by a certificate of conformity and you send us a request to amend your application, you may sell and distribute the new or modified configuration before we make a decision under paragraph (d) of this section, subject to the provisions of this paragraph. If we determine that the affected configurations do not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease production of the configurations and any containers from the new or modified configuration will not be considered covered by the certificate. In addition, we may require you to recall any affected containers that you have already distributed, including those sold to the ultimate purchasers. Choosing to produce containers under this paragraph (e) is deemed to be consent to recall all containers that we determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide information required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days, you must stop producing the new or modified containers.</P>

                <P>(b) Select an emission-data unit from each emission family for testing. You must test a production sample or a preproduction product that will represent actual production. Select the configuration that is most likely to exceed (or have emissions nearest to) the applicable emission standard. For example, for a family of multilayer portable fuel containers, test the container with the thinnest barrier layer. Test three identical containers.</P>

                <P>(1) You may request to use special procedures if your portable fuel containers cannot be tested using the specified procedures. We will approve your request if we determine that it would produce emission measurements that represent in-use operation and we determine that it can be used to show compliance with the requirements of § 59.611.</P>

                <P>(2) You may ask to use emission data collected using other procedures, such as those of the California Air Resources Board. We will approve this <PRTPAGE P="397"/>only if you show us that using these other procedures do not affect your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission standards. This generally requires emission levels to be far enough below the applicable emission standards so that any test differences do not affect your ability to state unconditionally that your containers will meet all applicable emission standards when tested using the specified test procedures.</P>
                <P>(3) You may request to use alternate procedures that are equivalent to allowed procedures, or more accurate or more precise than allowed procedures.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I test portable fuel containers?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You must test the portable fuel container as described in your application, with the applicable spout attached except as otherwise noted. Tighten fittings in a manner representative of how they would be tightened by a typical user.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Preconditioning for durability.</E> Complete the following steps before an emissions test, in any order, unless we determine that omission of one or more of these durability steps will not affect the emissions from your container.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Pressure cycling.</E> Perform a pressure test by sealing the container and cycling it between + 13.8 and −1.7 kPa (+2.0 and −0.5 psig) for 10,000 cycles at a rate of 60 seconds per cycle. For this test, the spout may be removed and the pressure applied through the opening where the spout attaches. The purpose of this test is to represent environmental wall stresses caused by pressure changes and other factors (such as vibration or thermal expansion). If your container cannot be tested using the pressure cycles specified by this paragraph (a)(1), you may ask to use special test procedures under § 59.652(c).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">UV exposure.</E> Perform a sunlight-exposure test by exposing the container to an ultraviolet light of at least 24 W/m<SU>2</SU> (0.40 W-hr/m<SU>2</SU>/min) on the container surface for at least 450 hours. Alternatively, the container may be exposed to direct natural sunlight for an equivalent period of time, as long as you ensure that the container is exposed to at least 450 daylight hours.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Slosh testing.</E> Perform a slosh test by filling the portable fuel container to 40 percent of its capacity with the fuel specified in paragraph (e) of this section and rocking it at a rate of 15 cycles per minute until you reach one million total cycles. Use an angle deviation of + 15° to −15° from level.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Spout actuation.</E> Perform the following spout actuation and inversion steps at the end on the slosh testing, and at the end of the preconditioning soak.</P>
                <P>(i) Perform one complete actuation/inversion cycle per day for ten days.</P>
                <P>(ii) One actuation/inversion cycle consists of the following steps:</P>
                <P>(A) Remove and replace the spout to simulate filling the container.</P>
                <P>(B) Slowly invert the container and keep it inverted for at least 5 seconds to ensure that the spout and mechanisms become saturated with fuel. Any fuel leaking from any part of the container will denote a leak and must be reported as part of certification. Once completed, place the container on a flat surface in the upright position.</P>
                <P>(C) Actuate the spout by fully opening and closing without dispensing fuel. The spout must return to the closed position without the aid of the operator (e.g., pushing or pulling the spout closed). Repeat for a total of 10 actuations. If at any point the spout fails to return to the closed position, the container fails the test.</P>
                <P>(D) Repeat the step contained in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section (i.e., the inversion step).</P>
                <P>(E) Repeat the steps contained in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(C) of this section (i.e., ten actuations).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Preconditioning fuel soak.</E> Complete the following steps before a diurnal emission test:</P>

                <P>(1) Fill the portable fuel container with the specified fuel to its nominal capacity, seal it using the spout, and allow it to soak at 28 ±5 °C for 20 weeks. Alternatively, the container may be soaked for 10 weeks at 43 ±5 °C. You may count the time of the preconditioning steps in paragraph (a) of this section as part of the preconditioning fuel soak, as long as the ambient temperature remains within the specified <PRTPAGE P="398"/>temperature range and the fuel tank is at least 40 percent full; you may add or replace fuel as needed to conduct the specified durability procedures.</P>
                <P>(2) Pour the fuel out of the container and immediately refill to 50 percent of nominal capacity. Be careful to not spill any fuel on the container. Wipe the outside of the container as needed to remove any liquid fuel that may have spilled on it.</P>
                <P>(3) Install the spout assembly that will be used in the production containers. The spout and other openings (such as vents) on the container must be tested in their open condition unless they close automatically and are unlikely to be left open by the user during typical storage. All manual closures such as caps must be left off the container and spout during testing.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reference container.</E> A reference container is required to correct for buoyancy effects that may occur during testing. Prepare the reference tank as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Obtain a second container of the same model as the test tank. You may not use a container that has previously contained fuel or any other contents that might affect the stability of its mass.</P>
                <P>(2) Fill the reference container with enough dry sand (or other inert material) so that the mass of the reference container is approximately the same as the test container when filled with fuel. Use good engineering judgment to determine how similar the mass of the reference container needs to be to the mass of the test container considering the performance characteristics of your balance.</P>
                <P>(3) Ensure that the sand (or other inert material) is dry. This may require heating the container or applying a vacuum to it.</P>
                <P>(4) Seal the container.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Diurnal test run.</E> To run the test, take the following steps for a portable fuel container that was preconditioned as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Stabilize the fuel temperature within the portable fuel container at 22.2 °C. Vent the container at this point to relieve any positive or negative pressure that may have developed during stabilization.</P>

                <P>(2) Weigh the sealed reference container and record the weight. Place the reference on the balance and tare it so that it reads zero. Place the sealed test container on the balance and record the difference between the test container and the reference container. This value is M<E T="52">initial</E> Take this measurement within 8 hours of filling the test container with fuel as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Immediately place the portable fuel container within a well ventilated, temperature-controlled room or enclosure. Do not spill or add any fuel.</P>
                <P>(4) Close the room or enclosure.</P>
                <P>(5) Follow the temperature profile in the following table for all portable fuel containers. Use good engineering judgment to follow this profile as closely as possible. You may use linearly interpolated temperatures or a spline fit for temperatures between the hourly setpoints.</P>

                <P>(6) At the end of the diurnal period, retare the balance using the reference container and weigh the portable fuel container. Record the difference in mass between the reference container and the test. This value is M<E T="52">final</E>.<PRTPAGE P="399"/>
                </P>
                <P>(7) Subtract M<E T="52">final</E> from M<E T="52">initial</E> and divide the difference by the nominal capacity of the container (using at least three significant figures) to calculate the g/gallon/day emission rate as follows:
                </P>

                <P>(8) Round your result to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard.</P>
                <P>(9) Instead of determining emissions by weighing the container before and after the diurnal temperature cycle, you may place the container in a SHED meeting the specifications of 40 CFR 86.107-96(a)(1) and measure emissions directly. Immediately following the stabilization in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, purge the SHED and follow the temperature profile from paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Start measuring emissions when you start the temperature profile and stop measuring emissions when the temperature profile concludes.</P>
                <P>(e) For metal containers, you may demonstrate for certification that your portable fuel containers comply with the evaporative emission standards without performing the pre-soak or container durability cycles (i.e., the pressure cycling, UV exposure, and slosh testing) specified in this section. For other containers, you may demonstrate compliance without performing the durability cycles specified in this section only if we approve it after you have presented data clearly demonstrating that the cycle or cycles do not negatively impact the permeation rate of the materials used in the containers.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Exemption from the standards.</SUBJECT>
                <P>In certain circumstances, we may exempt portable fuel containers from the evaporative emission standards and requirements of § 59.611 and the prohibitions and requirements of § 59.602. You do not need an exemption for any containers that you own but do not sell, offer for sale, introduce or deliver for introduction into U.S. commerce, or import into the United States. Submit your request for an exemption to the Designated Compliance Officer.</P>
                <P>(a) Portable fuel containers that are intended for export only and are in fact exported are exempt provided they are clearly labeled as being for export only. Keep records for five years of all portable fuel containers that you manufacture for export. Any introduction into U.S. commerce of such portable fuel containers for any purpose other than export is considered to be a violation of § 59.602 by the manufacturer.

                <P>(a) Prior to importing containers into the U.S., we may require you to post a bond to cover any potential compliance or enforcement actions under the Clean Air Act if you cannot demonstrate to us that you have assets of an appropriate liquidity readily available in the United States with a value equal to the retail value of the containers that you will import during the calendar year.</P>
                <P>(b) We may set the value of the bond up to five dollars per container.</P>

                <P>(c) You may meet the bond requirements of this section by obtaining a bond from a third-party surety that is cited in the U.S. Department of Treasury Circular 570, “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies” (<E T="03">http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/c570.html#certified</E>).</P>
                <P>(d) If you forfeit some or all of your bond in an enforcement action, you must post any appropriate bond for continuing importation within 90 days after you forfeit the bond amount.</P>
                <P>(e) You will forfeit the proceeds of the bond posted under this section if you need to satisfy any United States administrative final order or judicial judgment against you arising from your conduct in violation of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(f) This paragraph (f) applies if you import for resale containers that have been certified by someone else. You and the certificate holder are each responsible for compliance with the requirements of this subpart and the Clean Air Act. No bond is required under this section if either you or the certificate holder meet the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section. Otherwise, the importer must comply with the bond requirements of this section.</P>
