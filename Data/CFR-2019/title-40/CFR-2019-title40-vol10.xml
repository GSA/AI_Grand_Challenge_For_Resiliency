      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this section as follows:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Act</E> means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Administrator</E> means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or his authorized representative.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Alternative method</E> means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant which is not a reference method but which has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination of compliance.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Approved permit program</E> means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Capital expenditure</E> means an expenditure for a physical or operational change to a stationary source which exceeds the product of the applicable “annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage” specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 534 and the stationary source's basis, as defined by section 1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a physical or operational change to a stationary source must not be reduced by any “excluded additions” as defined for stationary sources constructed after December 31, 1981, in IRS Publication 534, as would be done for tax purposes. In addition, “annual asset guideline repair allowance” may be used even though it is excluded for tax purposes in IRS Publication 534.</P>

              <P>(10) The following table lists the delegation status of specific Part 61 Subparts that have been delegated unchanged to state and local air pollution control agencies in Region 10. An “X” indicates the subpart has been delegated, subject to all the conditions and limitations set forth in federal law, regulations, policy, guidance, and determinations. Some authorities cannot be delegated and are retained by EPA. These include certain General Provisions authorities and specific parts of some standards. The dates noted at the end of this table indicate the effective dates of federal rules that have been delegated. Any amendments made to these rules after this effective date are not delegated.<PRTPAGE P="29"/>

The use of reliable non-Government mail carriers that provide indications of verifiable delivery of information required to be submitted to the Administrator, similar to the postmark provided by the U.S. Postal Service, or alternative means of delivery agreed to by the permitting authority, is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(g) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) If an owner or operator of a stationary source in a State with delegated authority is required to submit reports under this part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the submission of reports that is consistent with the reporting frequency(ies) specified for such source under this part, the owner or operator may change the dates by which reports under this part shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the State. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary sources affected by standards set under this part and standards set under part 60, part 63, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a common schedule on which reports required by each applicable standard shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part, or 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable part 60 or part 63 standard, <PRTPAGE P="34"/>whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(j)(1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for in paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section each time he or she wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline specified in this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.</P>
              <P>(3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request.</P>
              <P>(4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.</P>

Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the source.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of a pollutant from a source at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of that pollutant from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, the Administrator will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with the standard. The notice will restrict the permission to the source(s) or category(ies) of sources on which the alternative means will achieve equivalent emission reductions. The notice may condition permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section, if required to do emission testing by an applicable subpart and unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under this section, the owner or operator shall test emissions from the source:</P>
              <P>(1) Within 90 days after the effective date, for an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date before the effective date.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 90 days after initial startup, for a new source which has an initial startup date after the effective date.</P>
              <P>(3) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section or beyond a deadline established pursuant to the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.</P>

              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the <PRTPAGE P="36"/>delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.</P>
              <P>(5) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(6) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to test emissions from the source at any other time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the emission test at least 30 days before the emission test to allow the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.</P>
              <P>(d) If required to do emission testing, the owner or operator of each new source and, at the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of each existing source shall provide emission testing facilities as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to each source.</P>
              <P>(2) Safe sampling platform(s).</P>
              <P>(3) Safe access to sampling platform(s).</P>
              <P>(4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.</P>
              <P>(5) Any other facilities that the Administrator needs to safely and properly test a source.</P>
              <P>(e) Each emission test shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify based on design and operational characteristics of the source.</P>

              <P>(1) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced <PRTPAGE P="37"/>when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.</P>

              <P>(i) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60 of this chapter; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix A-4 of part 60; Method 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60; Methods 30A and 30B of appendix A-8 of part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, <E T="03">www.epa.gov/ttn/emc,</E> to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request, and the compliance authority may grant, a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.</P>
              <P>(ii) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>(A) Preparing the sample;<PRTPAGE P="38"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;</P>
              <P>(C) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;</P>
              <P>(D) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;</P>
              <P>(E) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;</P>
              <P>(F) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;</P>
              <P>(G) Reporting the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and to the source owner, operator, or representative by the AASP. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.</P>
              <P>(H) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in consultation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed;</P>
              <P>(I) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.</P>
              <P>(iii) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit or samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>(A) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP.</P>
              <P>(B) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years.</P>
              <P>(C) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.</P>

              <P>(iv) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget <E T="03">Circular A-119.</E> A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at <E T="03">http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm.</E> The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this <PRTPAGE P="39"/>section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL, <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.</E>

              <P>(f) Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart, samples shall be analyzed and emissions determined within 30 days after each emission test has been completed. The owner or operator shall report the determinations of the emission test to the Administrator by a registered letter sent before the close of business on the 31st day following the completion of the emission test.</P>
              <P>(g) The owner or operator shall retain at the source and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 years, records of emission test results and other data needed to determine emissions.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Emission tests shall be conducted as set forth in this section, the applicable subpart and appendix B unless the Administrator—</P>

              <P>(ii) Approves the use of an alternative method; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Waives the requirement for emission testing because the owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the source is in compliance with the standard.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator may request approval for the use of an alternative method at any time, except—</P>
              <P>(i) For an existing source or a new source that had an initial startup before the effective date, any request for use of an alternative method during the initial emission test shall be submitted to the Administrator within 30 days after the effective date, or with the request for a waiver of compliance if one is submitted under § 60.10(b); or</P>
              <P>(ii) For a new source that has an initial startup after the effective date, any request for use of an alternative method during the initial emission test shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than with the notification of anticipated startup required under § 60.09.</P>
              <P>(i)(1) Emission tests may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the standard, or the source is being operated under a waiver or compliance, or the owner or operator has requested a waiver of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.</P>
              <P>(2) If application for waiver of the emission test is made, the application shall accompany the information required by § 61.10 or the notification of startup required by § 61.09, whichever is applicable. A possible format is contained in appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later cancelling the waiver.

              <P>(a) Unless otherwise specified, this section applies to each monitoring system required under each subpart which requires monitoring.</P>

              <P>(b) Each owner or operator shall maintain and operate each monitoring system as specified in the applicable subpart and in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Any unavoidable breakdown or malfunction of the monitoring system should be repaired or adjusted as soon as practicable after its occurrence. The Administrator's determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based <PRTPAGE P="40"/>on information which may include, but not be limited to, review of operating and maintenance procedures, manufacturer recommendations and specifications, and inspection of the monitoring system.</P>
              <P>(c) When required by the applicable subpart, and at any other time the Administrator may require, the owner or operator of a source being monitored shall conduct a performance evaluation of the monitoring system and furnish the Administrator with a copy of a written report of the results within 60 days of the evaluation. Such a performance evaluation shall be conducted according to the applicable specifications and procedures described in the applicable subpart. The owner or operator of the source shall furnish the Administrator with written notification of the date of the performance evaluation at least 30 days before the evaluation is to begin.</P>
              <P>(d) When the effluents from a single source, or from two or more sources subject to the same emission standards, are combined before being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall install a monitoring system on each effluent or on the combined effluent. If two or more sources are not subject to the same emission standards, the owner or operator shall install a separate monitoring system on each effluent, unless otherwise specified. If the applicable standard is a mass emission standard and the effluent from one source is released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the owner or operator shall install a monitoring system at each emission point unless the installation of fewer systems is approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator of each monitoring system shall reduce the monitoring data as specified in each applicable subpart.

              <SUBJECT>Modification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, any physical or operational change to a stationary source which results in an increase in the rate of emission to the atmosphere of a hazardous pollutant to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon modification, an existing source shall become a new source for each hazardous pollutant for which the rate of emission to the atmosphere increases and to which a standard applies.</P>
              <P>(c) Emission rate shall be expressed as kg/hr of any hazardous pollutant discharged into the atmosphere for which a standard is applicable. The Administrator shall use the following to determine the emission rate:</P>

              <P>(1) Emission factors as specified in the background information document (BID) for the applicable standard, or in the latest issue of “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,” EPA Publication No. AP-42, or other emission factors determined by the Administrator to be superior to AP-42 emission factors, in cases where use of emission factors demonstrates that the emission rate will clearly increase or clearly not increase as a result of the physical or operational change.<PRTPAGE P="41"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Material balances, monitoring data, or manual emission tests in cases where use of emission factors, as referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, does not demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the emission rate will clearly increase or clearly not increase as a result of the physical or operational change, or where an interested person demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds to dispute the result obtained by the Administrator using emission factors. When the emission rate is based on results from manual emission tests or monitoring data, the procedures specified in appendix C of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine whether an increase in emission rate has occurred. Tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to the owner or operator. At least three test runs must be conducted before and at least three after the physical or operational change. If the Administrator approves, the results of the emission tests required in § 61.13(a) may be used for the test runs to be conducted before the physical or operational change. All operating parameters which may affect emissions must be held constant to the maximum degree feasible for all test runs.</P>
              <P>(d) The following shall not, by themselves, be considered modifications under this part:</P>
              <P>(1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement which the Administrator determines to be routine for a source category.</P>
              <P>(2) An increase in production rate of a stationary source, if that increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on the stationary source.</P>
              <P>(3) An increase in the hours of operation.</P>
              <P>(4) Any conversion to coal that meets the requirements specified in section 111(a)(8) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(5) The relocation or change in ownership of a stationary source. However, such activities must be reported in accordance with § 61.10(c).</P>

Parameter excursions will be considered unacceptable operation and maintenance of the emission control system. In addition, while compliance with the emission limits is determined primarily by conducting a performance test according to the procedures in § 61.53(b), reports of parameter excursions may be used as evidence in judging the duration of a violation that is determined by a performance test.</P>

To be approved, such a plan must ensure not only compliance with the emission limits of § 61.52(a) but also proper operation and maintenance of emissions control systems. Any site-specific monitoring plan submitted must, at a minimum, include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Identification of the critical parameter or parameters for the hydrogen stream and for the end-box ventilation stream that are to be monitored and an explanation of why the critical parameter(s) selected is the best indicator of proper control system performance and of mercury emission rates.</P>

              <P>(3) Designation of the frequency for recording the parameter measurements, with justification if the frequency is less than hourly. A longer recording frequency must be justified on the basis of the amount of time that could elapse during periods of process or control system upsets before the emission limits would be exceeded, and consideration is to be given to the time that would be necessary to repair the failure.</P>
              <P>(4) Designation of the immediate actions to be taken in the event of an excursion beyond the value of the parameter established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) The requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section are to be incorporated into a standard operating procedure, and made available upon request for inspection by the Administrator. The standard operating procedure is to include provisions for measuring the vinyl chloride in equipment 4.75 m<SU>3</SU> (1255 gal) in volume for which <PRTPAGE P="62"/>an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.65(b)(6)(i) after opening the equipment and using Method 106, a portable hydrocarbon detector, or an alternative method. The method of measurement is to meet the requirements in § 61.67(g)(5)(i)(A) or (g)(5)(i)(B).</P>
              <P>(d) A RVD that is ducted to a control device that is continually operating while emissions from the release are present at the device is subject to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) A discharge from a control device other than a flare shall not exceed 10 ppm (average over a 3-hour period) as determined by the continuous emission monitor system required under § 61.68. Such a discharge is subject to the requirements of § 61.70.</P>
              <P>(2) For a discharge routed to a flare, the flare shall comply with the requirements of § 60.18.</P>
              <P>(i) Flare operations shall be monitored in accordance with the requirements of §§ 60.18(d) and 60.18(f)(2). For the purposes of § 60.18(d), the volume and component concentration of each relief valve discharge shall be estimated and calculation shall be made to verify ongoing compliance with the design and operating requirements of §§ 60.18 (c)(3) through (c)(6). If more than one relief valve is discharged simultaneously to a single flare, these calculations shall account for the cumulative effect of all such relief valve discharges. These calculations shall be made and reported quarterly for all discharges within the quarter. Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this paragraph will be a violation of § 61.65(d)(2). Monitoring for the presence of a flare pilot flame shall be conducted in accordance with § 60.18(f)(2). If the results of this monitoring or any other information shows that the pilot flame is not present 100 percent of the time during which a relief valve discharge is routed to the flare, the relief valve discharge is subject to the provisions of § 61.65(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) A report describing the flare design shall be provided to the Administrator not later than 90 days after the adoption of this provision or within 30 days of the installation of a flare system for control of relief valve discharge whichever is later. The flare design report shall include calculations based upon expected relief valve discharge component concentrations and net heating values (for PVC this calculation shall be based on values expected if a release occurred at the instant the polymerization starts); and estimated maximum exit velocities based upon the design throat capacity of the gas in the relief valve.</P>

              <P>(a) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under § 61.13, the owner or operator of a source to which this subpart applies shall test emissions from the source,</P>
              <P>(1) Within 90 days of the effective date in the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the effective date, or</P>
              <P>(2) Within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source, initial startup of which occurs after the effective date.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of an emission test to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.</P>
              <P>(c) Any emission test is to be conducted while the equipment being tested is operating at the maximum production rate at which the equipment will be operated and under other relevant conditions as may be specified by the Administrator based on representative performance of the source.</P>
              <P>(d) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(e) When at all possible, each sample is to be analyzed within 24 hours, but <PRTPAGE P="63"/>in no case in excess of 72 hours of sample collection. Vinyl chloride emissions are to be determined within 30 days after the emission test. The owner or operator shall report the determinations to the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched before the close of the next business day following the determination.</P>
              <P>(f) The owner or operator shall retain at the plant and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 3 years, records of emission test results and other data needed to determine emissions.</P>
              <P>(g) Unless otherwise specified, the owner or operator shall use the test methods in appendix B to this part for each test as required by paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), (g)(4), and (g)(5) of this section, unless an alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn. Whenever Method 107 is specified, and the conditions in Section 1.2, “Applicability” of Method 107A are met, Method 107A may be used.</P>
              <P>(1) Method 106 is to be used to determine the vinyl chloride emissions from any source for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.62(a) or (b), § 61.63(a), or § 61.64(a)(1), (b), (c), or (d), or from any control system to which reactor emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.65(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), or (b)(9)(ii).</P>

              <P>(i) For each run, one sample is to be collected. The sampling site is to be at least two stack or duct diameters downstream and one half diameter upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, contraction, or visible flame. For a rectangular cross section, an equivalent diameter is to be determined from the following equation:

The sample is to contain a minimum volume of 50 liters (1.8 ft<SU>3</SU>) corrected to standard conditions and is to be taken over a period as close to 1 hour as practicable.</FP>
              <P>(ii) Each emission test is to consist of three runs. For the purpose of determining emissions, the average of results of all runs is to apply. The average is to be computed on a time weighted basis.</P>
              <P>(iii) For gas streams containing more that 10 percent oxygen, the concentration of vinyl chloride as determined by Method 106 is to be corrected to 10 percent oxygen (dry basis) for determination of emissions by using the following equation:</P>

              <P>(h)(1) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably contain equipment in vinyl chloride service is presumed to be in vinyl chloride service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in vinyl chloride service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in vinyl chloride service, it must be determined that the percent vinyl chloride content can be reasonably expected not to exceed 10 percent by weight for liquid streams or contained liquid volumes and 10 percent by volume for gas streams or contained gas volumes, which also includes gas volumes above liquid streams or contained liquid volumes. For purposes of determining the percent vinyl chloride content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, procedures that conform to the methods described in ASTM D2267-68, 78, or 88 or D4420-94 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 61.18) shall be used.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section to demonstrate that the percent vinyl chloride content does not exceed 10 percent by weight for liquid streams and 10 percent by volume for gas streams, provided that the engineering judgment demonstrates that the vinyl chloride content clearly does not exceed 10 percent. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in vinyl chloride service, however, the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in vinyl chloride service, the determination can be revised only after following the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Samples used in determining the percent vinyl chloride content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emission monitoring.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A vinyl chloride monitoring system is to be used to monitor on a continuous basis the emissions from the sources for which emission limits are prescribed in §§ 61.62 (a) and (b), 61.63(a), and 61.64 (a)(1), (b), (c), and (d), and for any control system to which reactor emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.65 (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6) (ii), and (b)(9)(ii).</P>
              <P>(b) The vinyl chloride monitoring system(s) used to meet the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section is to be a device which obtains representative samples from one or more applicable emission points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples with gas chromatography or, if the owner or operator assumes that all hydrocarbons measured are vinyl chloride, with infrared spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an alternative method. The vinyl chloride monitoring system used to meet the requirements in § 61.65(b)(8)(i) may be used to meet the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) A daily span check is to be conducted for each vinyl chloride monitoring system used. For all of the emission sources listed in paragraph (a) of this section, except the one for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.62(b), the daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride equal to 10 ppm. For the emission source for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.62(b), the daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride which is determined to be equivalent to the emission limit for that source based on the emission test required by § 61.67. The calibration is to be done with either:</P>

              <P>(1) A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 and in accordance with Section 10.1 of Method 106, or<PRTPAGE P="68"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration gas cylinder standard is to have been certified by the manufacturer. The manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. The date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration and recommended maximum shelf life must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas chromatograph is used as the vinyl chloride monitoring system, these gas mixtures may be directly used to prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Sections 8.1 and 9.2 of Method 106. The requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 of Method 106 for certification of cylinder standards and for establishment and verification of calibration standards are to be followed.</P>
              <P>(d) When exhaust gas(es), having emission limits that are subject to the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, are emitted to the atmosphere without passing through the control system and required vinyl chloride monitoring system, the vinyl chloride content of the emission shall be calculated (in units of each applicable emission limit) by best practical engineering judgment based on the discharge duration and known VC concentrations in the affected equipment as determined in accordance with § 61.67(h) or other acceptable method.</P>
              <P>(e) For each 3-hour period, the vinyl chloride content of emissions subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section shall be averaged (weighted according to the proportion of time that emissions were continuously monitored and that emissions bypassed the continuous monitor) for purposes of reporting excess emissions under § 61.70(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(f) For each vinyl chloride emission to the atmosphere determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section to be in excess of the applicable emission limits, the owner or operator shall record the identity of the source(s), the date, time, and duration of the excess emission, the cause of the excess emission, and the approximate total vinyl chloride loss during the excess emission, and the method used for determining the vinyl chloride loss. This information shall be retained and made available for inspection by the Administrator as required by § 61.71(a).</P>

              <P>(c) Unless otherwise specified, the owner or operator shall use the test methods in appendix B to this part to conduct emission tests as required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, unless an alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall include in the report a record of the vinyl chloride content of emissions for each 3-hour period during which average emissions are in excess of the emission limits in § 61.62(a) or (b), § 61.63(a), or § 61.64(a)(1), (b), (c), or (d), or during which average emissions are in excess of the emission limits specified for any control system to which reactor emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.65(b)(I)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), or (b)(9)(ii). The number of 3-hour periods for which average emissions were determined during the reporting period shall be reported. If emissions in excess of the emission limits are not detected, the report shall contain a statement that no excess emissions have been detected. The emissions are to be determined in accordance with § 61.68(e).</P>

              <P>Emissions of radionuclides to the ambient air from Department of Energy facilities shall not exceed those amounts that would cause any member of the public to receive in any year an effective dose equivalent of 10 mrem/yr.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emission monitoring and test procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To determine compliance with the standard, radionuclide emissions shall be determined and effective dose equivalent values to members of the public calculated using EPA approved sampling procedures, computer models CAP-88 or AIRDOS-PC, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval. DOE facilities for which the maximally exposed individual lives within 3 kilometers of all sources of emissions in the facility, may use EPA's COMPLY model and associated procedures for determining dose for purposes of compliance.</P>
              <P>(b) Radionuclides emission rates from existing point sources (stacks or vents) shall be measured in accordance with the following requirements or with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:</P>
              <P>(1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the following methods:</P>
              <P>(i) Reference Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large vents.</P>
              <P>(ii) Reference Method 2A of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.</P>
              <P>(iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon the variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) Radionuclides shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected and measured using the following methods:</P>
              <P>(i) Reference Method 1 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to select monitoring or sampling sites.</P>

              <P>(ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent stream shall be <PRTPAGE P="73"/>withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following the guidance presented in ANSIN13.1-1969 “Guide to Sampling Airborne Radioactive Materials in Nuclear Facilities” (including the guidance presented in appendix A of ANSIN13.1) (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18). The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the emissions.</P>
              <P>(iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 114. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve measurement procedures.</P>
              <P>(iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.</P>
              <P>(3) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at an existing source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at an existing source in accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.</P>
              <P>(ii) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.</P>
              <P>(iii) The alternative procedure is fully documented.</P>
              <P>(iv) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be made at all release points which have a potential to discharge radionuclides into the air in quantities which could cause an effective dose equivalent in excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides which could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other release points which have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low emissions.</P>
              <P>(ii) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise normal.</P>
              <P>(5) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously sampled for collection of radionuclides.</P>
              <P>(ii) Those radionuclides released from the facility, which are the major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected and measured as part of the environmental measurement program.</P>
              <P>(iii) Radionuclide concentrations which would cause an effective dose equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and distinguishable from background.</P>

              <P>(iv) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E to determine compliance with <PRTPAGE P="74"/>the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in Table 2, and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 for each radionuclide is less than 1.</P>
              <P>(v) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.</P>
              <P>(vi) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.</P>
              <P>(c) Radionuclide emission rates from new point sources (stacks or vents) as defined in subpart A shall be measured in accordance with the following requirements, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:</P>
              <P>(1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the following methods:</P>

              <P>(ii) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.</P>

              <P>(ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following the guidance presented in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999. The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval.

              <P>(d) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at a source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (c) of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at a source in accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) or (c) of this section, the facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) or (c) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.</P>
              <P>(2) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.</P>
              <P>(3) The alternative procedure is fully documented.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.</P>

              <P>(e) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be made at all release <PRTPAGE P="75"/>points that have a potential to discharge radionuclides into the air in quantities that could cause an effective dose equivalent in excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides that could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured.

              <P>(iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon the variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.<PRTPAGE P="80"/>

The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the emissions.</P>
              <P>(iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 114. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve alternative measurement procedures in whole or in part.</P>

              <P>(i) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.</P>
              <P>(ii) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.</P>

All radionuclides which could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured. For other release points which have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements should be made to verify the low emissions.</P>
              <P>(ii) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to discharge radionuclides into the air, the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge of the uncontrolled effluent stream into the air.</P>
              <P>(5) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standards if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously sampled for collection of radionuclides.</P>

              <P>(iii) Radionuclide concentrations which would cause an effective dose equivalent greater than or equal to 10% <PRTPAGE P="81"/>of the standard shall be readily detectable and distinguishable from background.</P>
              <P>(iv) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E to determine compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in Table 2 and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 for each radionuclide is less than 1.</P>
              <P>(v) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.</P>
              <P>(vi) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.</P>

For other release points that have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low emissions.</P>
              <P>(g) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise normal.</P>
              <P>(h) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:</P>

The annual polonium-210 emission rate from a calciner or nodulizing kiln shall be determined by multiplying the measured polonium-210 emission rate in curies per Mg or curies per ton of phosphate rock processed by the annual phosphate rock processing rate in Mg (tons). In determining the annual phosphate rock processing rate, the values used for operating hours and operating capacity shall be values that will maximize the expected processing rate. For determining compliance with the emission standard of § 61.122, the total annual emission rate is the sum of the annual emission rates for all operating calciners and nodulizing kilns.</P>

This monitoring and inspection shall be conducted on a semiannual basis and at any other time after the control system is repressurized with blanketing gas following removal of the cover or opening of the access hatch.</P>
              <P>(1) If an instrument reading indicates an organic chemical concentration more than 500 ppm above a background concentration, as measured by Method 21, a leak is detected.</P>
              <P>(2) If visible defects such as gaps in sealing materials are observed during a visual inspection, a leak is detected.</P>
              <P>(3) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected.</P>
              <P>(4) A first attempt at repair of any leak or visible defect shall be made no later than 5 calendar days after each leak is detected.</P>
              <P>(c) Following the installation of any control system used to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct a maintenance inspection of the control system on an annual basis for evidence of system abnormalities, such as blocked or plugged lines, sticking valves, plugged condensate traps, and other maintenance defects that could result in abnormal system operation. The owner or operator shall make a first attempt at repair within 5 days, with repair within 15 days of detection.</P>

              <P>(d) Each owner or operator of a furnace coke by-product recovery plant <PRTPAGE P="89"/>also shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)-(c) of this section for each benzene storage tank, BTX storage tank, light-oil storage tank, and excess ammonia-liquor storage tank.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>This note provides an example of the monitoring schedules in paragraphs (e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section. Assume that the scheduled replacement time for a non-regenerative carbon adsorber is the 105th day after installation. According to the monitoring schedule in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, initial monitoring would be done within 7 days after installation, monthly monitoring would be done on the 30th, 60th and 90th days, and daily monitoring would begin on the 95th day after installation. Now assume that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 90th day after installation. On the replacement carbon bed, the owner or operator would begin daily monitoring on the 61st day after installation (i.e., the day after the last scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was detected), according to the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If, instead, the exceedance were detected on the first bed on the 95th day, the daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on the 85th day after installation (i.e., 10 days before the point in the cycle where the exceedance was detected); this is a second example of the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Finally, assume that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 100th day after the first carbon adsorber was installed. According to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on the 90th day after installation (i.e., 10 days earlier than when the exceedance was detected on the previous bed). In all of these examples, the initial monitoring of the replacement bed within 7 days of installation and the monthly monitoring would proceed as set out in paragraph (e)(3) of this section until daily monitoring was required.</P>

              <P>(i) Where a vapor incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.</P>

              <P>(i) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow to the incinerator at least once every hour for each source. The flow indicator shall be installed in the vent stream from each source at a point closest to the inlet of each vapor incinerator and before being joined with any other vent stream.</P>
              <P>(ii) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow away from the vapor incinerator at least once every 15 minutes. The flow indicator shall be installed in each bypass line, immediately downstream of the valve that, if opened, would divert the vent stream away from the vapor incinerator.</P>
              <P>(iii) Where a valve that opens a bypass line is secured in the closed position with a car seal or a lock-and-key configuration, a flow indicator is not required. The owner or operator shall perform a visual inspection at least once every month to check the position of the valve and the condition of the car seal or lock-and-key configuration. The owner or operator shall also record the date and duration of each time that the valve was opened and the vent stream diverted away from the vapor incinerator.</P>
              <P>(g) In conducting the compliance tests required in § 61.139(c), and measurements specified in § 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and (h)(3)(ii), the owner or operator shall use as reference methods the test methods and procedures in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, or other methods as specified in this paragraph, except as specified in § 61.13.</P>
              <P>(1) For compliance tests, as described in § 61.139(c)(1), the following provisions apply.</P>
              <P>(i) All tests shall be run under representative emission concentration and vent flow rate conditions. For sources with intermittent flow rates, representative conditions shall include typical emission surges (for example, during the loading of a storage tank).</P>
              <P>(ii) Each test shall consist of three separate runs. These runs will be averaged to yield the volumetric flow rates and benzene concentrations in the equation in § 61.139(c)(1). Each run shall be a minimum of 1 hour.</P>
              <P>(A) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, each run shall take place in one adsorption cycle, to include a minimum of 1 hour of sampling immediately preceding the initiation of carbon bed regeneration.</P>

              <P>(vi) Method 18 shall be used for determining the benzene concentrations (C<E T="52">aj</E> and C<E T="52">bi</E>). Either the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure or the direct interface procedure may be used. A separation column constructed of stainless steel, 1.83 m by 3.2 mm, containing 10 percent 1,2,3-tris (2-cyanoethoxy) propane (TECP) on 80/100 mesh Chromosorb P AW, with a column temperature of 80 °C, a detector temperature of 225 °C, and a flow rate of approximately 20 ml/min, may produce adequate separations. The analyst can use other columns, provided that the precision and accuracy of the analysis of benzene standards is not impaired. The analyst shall have available for review information confirming that there is adequate resolution of the benzene peak.</P>
              <P>(A) If the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure is used, the sample rate shall be adjusted to maintain a constant proportion to vent flow rate.</P>

              <P>(B) If the direct interface sampling and analysis procedure is used, then each performance test run shall be conducted in intervals of 5 minutes. For each interval “t,” readings from each measurement shall be recorded, and the flow rate (Q<E T="52">aj</E> or Q<E T="52">bi</E>) and the corresponding benzene concentration (C<E T="52">aj</E> or C<E T="52">bi</E>) shall be determined. The sampling system shall be constructed to include a mixing chamber of a volume equal to 5 times the sampling flow rate <PRTPAGE P="96"/>per minute. Each analysis performed by the chromatograph will then represent an averaged emission value for a 5-minute time period. The vent flow rate readings shall be timed to account for the total sample system residence time. A dual column, dual detector chromatograph can be used to achieve an analysis interval of 5 minutes. The individual benzene concentrations shall be vent flow rate weighted to determine sample run average concentrations. The individual vent flow rates shall be time averaged to determine sample run average flow rates.</P>

              <P>(ii) At the request of the Administrator; and</P>
              <P>(iii) At any time chosen by the owner or operator.</P>
              <P>(2) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall determine the maximum concentration point at the following times:</P>
              <P>(i) On the first carbon bed to be installed in the adsorber;</P>
              <P>(ii) At the request of the Administrator;</P>
              <P>(iii) On the next carbon bed after the maximum concentration point has been exceeded (before the scheduled replacement time) for each of three previous carbon beds in the adsorber since the most recent determination; and</P>
              <P>(iv) At any other time chosen by the owner or operator.</P>
              <P>(3) The maximum concentration point for each carbon adsorber shall be determined through the simultaneous measurement of the outlet of the carbon adsorber with the monitoring device and Method 18, except as allowed in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Several data points shall be collected according to a schedule determined by the owner or operator. The schedule shall be designed to take frequent samples near the expected maximum concentration point.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each data point shall consist of one 5-minute benzene concentration measurement using Method 18 as specified in § 61.139(g)(2), and of a simultaneous measurement by the monitoring device. The monitoring device measurement shall be conducted according to § 61.139 (d) or (e), whichever is applicable.</P>
              <P>(iii) The maximum concentration point shall be the concentration level, as indicated by the monitoring device, for the last data point at which the benzene concentration is less than 2 percent of the average value of the benzene concentration at the inlet to the carbon adsorber during the most recent compliance test.</P>
              <P>(4) If the maximum concentration point is expressed as a benzene concentration, the owner or operator may determine it by calibrating the monitoring device with benzene at a concentration that is 2 percent of the average benzene concentration measured at the inlet to the carbon adsorber during the most recent compliance test. The reading on the monitoring device corresponding to the calibration concentration shall be the maximum concentration point. This method of determination would affect the owner or operator as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Remove all RACM from a facility being demolished or renovated before any activity begins that would break up, dislodge, or similarly disturb the material or preclude access to the material for subsequent removal. RACM need not be removed before demolition if:</P>
              <P>(i) It is Category I nonfriable ACM that is not in poor condition and is not friable.</P>
              <P>(ii) It is on a facility component that is encased in concrete or other similarly hard material and is adequately wet whenever exposed during demolition; or</P>
              <P>(iii) It was not accessible for testing and was, therefore, not discovered until after demolition began and, as a result of the demolition, the material cannot be safely removed. If not removed for safety reasons, the exposed RACM and any asbestos-contaminated debris must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and adequately wet at all times until disposed of.</P>
              <P>(iv) They are Category II nonfriable ACM and the probability is low that the materials will become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder during demolition.</P>
              <P>(2) When a facility component that contains, is covered with, or is coated with RACM is being taken out of the facility as a unit or in sections:</P>
              <P>(i) Adequately wet all RACM exposed during cutting or disjoining operations; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Carefully lower each unit or section to the floor and to ground level, not dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or disturbing the RACM.</P>
              <P>(3) When RACM is stripped from a facility component while it remains in place in the facility, adequately wet the RACM during the stripping operation.</P>
              <P>(i) In renovation operations, wetting is not required if:</P>
              <P>(A) The owner or operator has obtained prior written approval from the Administrator based on a written application that wetting to comply with this paragraph would unavoidably damage equipment or present a safety hazard; and</P>

              <P>(B) The owner or operator uses of the following emission control methods:<PRTPAGE P="108"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A local exhaust ventilation and collection system designed and operated to capture the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping and removal of the asbestos materials. The system must exhibit no visible emissions to the outside air or be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements in § 61.152.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A glove-bag system designed and operated to contain the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping of the asbestos materials.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Leak-tight wrapping to contain all RACM prior to dismantlement.</P>
              <P>(ii) In renovation operations where wetting would result in equipment damage or a safety hazard, and the methods allowed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section cannot be used, another method may be used after obtaining written approval from the Administrator based upon a determination that it is equivalent to wetting in controlling emissions or to the methods allowed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) A copy of the Administrator's written approval shall be kept at the worksite and made available for inspection.</P>
              <P>(4) After a facility component covered with, coated with, or containing RACM has been taken out of the facility as a unit or in sections pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, it shall be stripped or contained in leak-tight wrapping, except as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If stripped, either:</P>
              <P>(i) Adequately wet the RACM during stripping; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Use a local exhaust ventilation and collection system designed and operated to capture the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping. The system must exhibit no visible emissions to the outside air or be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements in § 61.152.</P>
              <P>(5) For large facility components such as reactor vessels, large tanks, and steam generators, but not beams (which must be handled in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this section), the RACM is not required to be stripped if the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The component is removed, transported, stored, disposed of, or reused without disturbing or damaging the RACM.</P>
              <P>(ii) The component is encased in a leak-tight wrapping.</P>
              <P>(iii) The leak-tight wrapping is labeled according to § 61.149(d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) during all loading and unloading operations and during storage.</P>
              <P>(6) For all RACM, including material that has been removed or stripped:</P>
              <P>(i) Adequately wet the material and ensure that it remains wet until collected and contained or treated in preparation for disposal in accordance with § 61.150; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Carefully lower the material to the ground and floor, not dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or disturbing the material.</P>
              <P>(iii) Transport the material to the ground via leak-tight chutes or containers if it has been removed or stripped more than 50 feet above ground level and was not removed as units or in sections.</P>

              <P>(iv) RACM contained in leak-tight wrapping that has been removed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(3)(i)(B)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section need not be wetted.</P>
              <P>(7) When the temperature at the point of wetting is below 0 °C (32 °F):</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator need not comply with paragraph (c)(2)(i) and the wetting provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator shall remove facility components containing, coated with, or covered with RACM as units or in sections to the maximum extent possible.</P>
              <P>(iii) During periods when wetting operations are suspended due to freezing temperatures, the owner or operator must record the temperature in the area containing the facility components at the beginning, middle, and end of each workday and keep daily temperature records available for inspection by the Administrator during normal business hours at the demolition or renovation site. The owner or operator shall retain the temperature records for at least 2 years.</P>

              <P>(8) Effective 1 year after promulgation of this regulation, no RACM shall <PRTPAGE P="109"/>be stripped, removed, or otherwise handled or disturbed at a facility regulated by this section unless at least one on-site representative, such as a foreman or management-level person or other authorized representative, trained in the provisions of this regulation and the means of complying with them, is present. Every 2 years, the trained on-site individual shall receive refresher training in the provisions of this regulation. The required training shall include as a minimum: applicability; notifications; material identification; control procedures for removals including, at least, wetting, local exhaust ventilation, negative pressure enclosures, glove-bag procedures, and High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; waste disposal work practices; reporting and recordkeeping; and asbestos hazards and worker protection. Evidence that the required training has been completed shall be posted and made available for inspection by the Administrator at the demolition or renovation site.</P>
              <P>(9) For facilities described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, adequately wet the portion of the facility that contains RACM during the wrecking operation.</P>
              <P>(10) If a facility is demolished by intentional burning, all RACM including Category I and Category II nonfriable ACM must be removed in accordance with the NESHAP before burning.</P>

              <P>(a) Comply with one of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Either discharge no visible emissions to the outside air from an inactive waste disposal site subject to this paragraph; or</P>
              <P>(2) Cover the asbestos-containing waste material with at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) of compacted nonasbestos-containing material, and grow and maintain a cover of vegetation on the area adequate to prevent exposure of the asbestos-containing waste material. In desert areas where vegetation would be difficult to maintain, at least 8 additional centimeters (3 inches) of well-graded, nonasbestos crushed rock may be placed on top of the final cover instead of vegetation and maintained to prevent emissions; or</P>
              <P>(3) Cover the asbestos-containing waste material with at least 60 centimeters (2 feet) of compacted nonasbestos-containing material, and maintain it to prevent exposure of the asbestos-containing waste; or</P>
              <P>(4) For inactive waste disposal sites for asbestos tailings, a resinous or petroleum-based dust suppression agent that effectively binds dust to control surface air emissions may be used instead of the methods in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section. Use the agent in the manner and frequency recommended for the particular asbestos tailings by the manufacturer of the dust suppression agent to achieve and maintain dust control. Obtain prior written approval of the Administrator to use other equally effective dust suppression agents. For purposes of this paragraph, any used, spent, or other waste oil is not considered a dust suppression agent.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless a natural barrier adequately deters access by the general public, install and maintain warning signs and fencing as follows, or comply with paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Display warning signs at all entrances and at intervals of 100 m (328 ft) or less along the property line of the site or along the perimeter of the sections of the site where asbestos-containing waste material was deposited. The warning signs must:</P>
              <P>(i) Be posted in such a manner and location that a person can easily read the legend; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Conform to the requirements for 51 cm × 36 cm (20″ × 14″) upright format signs specified in 29 CFR 1910.145(d)(4) and this paragraph; and</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Applicability of the Asbestos NESHAP</HD>
              <P>1.1. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) is material containing more than one percent asbestos as determined using the methods specified in appendix E, subpart E, 40 CFR part 763, section 1, Polarized Light Microscopy. The NESHAP classifies ACM as either “friable” or “nonfriable”. Friable ACM is ACM that, when dry, can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure. Nonfriable ACM is ACM that, when dry, cannot be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure.</P>
              <P>1.2. Nonfriable ACM is further classified as either Category I ACM or Category II ACM. Category I ACM and Category II ACM are distinguished from each other by their potential to release fibers when damaged. Category I ACM includes asbestos-containing gaskets, packings, resilient floor coverings, resilient floor covering mastic, and asphalt roofing products containing more than one percent asbestos. Asphalt roofing products which may contain asbestos include built-up roofing; asphalt-containing single ply membrane systems; asphalt shingles; asphalt-containing underlayment felts; asphalt-containing roof coatings and mastics; and asphalt-containing base flashings. ACM roofing products that use other bituminous or resinous binders (such as coal tars or pitches) are also considered to be Category I ACM. Category II ACM includes all other nonfriable ACM, for example, asbestos-cement (A/C) shingles, A/C tiles, and transite boards or panels containing more than one percent asbestos. Generally speaking, Category II ACM is more likely to become friable when damaged than is Category I ACM. The applicability of the NESHAP to Category I and II ACM depends on: (1) the condition of the material at the time of demolition or renovation, (2) the nature of the operation to which the material will be subjected, (3) the amount of ACM involved.</P>
              <P>1.3. Asbestos-containing material regulated under the NESHAP is referred to as “regulated asbestos-containing material” (RACM). RACM is defined in § 61.141 of the NESHAP and includes: (1) friable asbestos-containing material; (2) Category I nonfriable ACM that has become friable; (3) Category I nonfriable ACM that has been or will be sanded, ground, cut, or abraded; or (4) Category II nonfriable ACM that has already been or is likely to become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder. If the coverage threshold for RACM is met or exceeded in a renovation or demolition operation, then all friable ACM in the operation, and in certain situations, nonfriable ACM in the operation, are subject to the NESHAP.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. Threshold Amounts of Asbestos-Containing Roofing Material</HD>
              <P>1.A.1. The NESHAP does not cover roofing projects on single family homes or on residential buildings containing four or fewer dwelling units. 40 CFR 61.141. For other roofing renovation projects, if the total asbestos-containing roof area undergoing renovation is less than 160 ft<SU>2</SU>, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the removal method to be used, the type of material (Category I or II), or its condition (friable versus nonfriable). 40 CFR 61.145(a)(4). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. EPA has determined that where a rotating blade (RB) roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, the removal of 5580 ft<SU>2</SU> of that material will create 160 ft<SU>2</SU> of RACM. For the purposes of this interpretive rule, “RB roof cutter” means an engine-powered roof cutting machine with one or more rotating cutting blades the edges of which are blunt. (Equipment with blades having sharp or tapered edges, and/or which does not use a rotating blade, is used for “slicing” rather than “cutting” the roofing material; such equipment is not included in the term “RB roof cutter”.) Therefore, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, any project that is 5580 ft<SU>2</SU> or greater is subject to the NESHAP; conversely, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material in a roof removal project that is less than 5580 ft<SU>2</SU>, the project is not subject to the NESHAP, except that notification is always required for demolitions. EPA further construes the NESHAP to mean that if slicing or other methods that do not sand, grind, cut or abrade will be used on Category I nonfriable ACM, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the area of roof to be removed.</P>

              <P>1.A.2. For asbestos cement (A/C) shingles (or other Category II roofing material), if the area of the roofing material to be removed is at least 160 ft<SU>2</SU> and the removal methods will <PRTPAGE P="127"/>crumble, pulverize, reduce to powder, or contaminate with RACM (from other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder) 160 ft<SU>2</SU> or more of such roofing material, the removal is subject to the NESHAP. Conversely, if the area of the A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) to be removed is less than 160 ft<SU>2</SU>, the removal is not subject to the NESHAP regardless of the removal method used, except that notification is always required for demolitions. 40 CFR 61.145(a). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. If A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) are removed without 160 ft<SU>2</SU> or more of such roofing material being crumbled, pulverized, reduced to powder, or contaminated with RACM (from other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder), the operation is not subject to the NESHAP, even where the total area of the roofing material to be removed exceeds 160 ft<SU>2</SU>; provided, however, that if the renovation includes other operations involving RACM, the roof removal operation is covered if the total area of RACM from all renovation activities exceeds 160 ft<SU>2</SU>. <E T="03">See</E> the definition of regulated asbestos-containing material (RACM), 40 CFR 61.141.</P>

              <P>1.A.3. Only roofing material that meets the definition of ACM can qualify as RACM subject to the NESHAP. Therefore, to determine if a removal operation that meets or exceeds the coverage threshold is subject to the NESHAP, any suspect roofing material (<E T="03">i.e.</E> roofing material that may be ACM) should be tested for asbestos. If any such roofing material contains more than one percent asbestos and if the removal operation is covered by the NESHAP, then EPA must be notified and the work practices in § 61.145(c) must be followed. In EPA's view, if a removal operation involves at least the threshold level of suspect material, a roofing contractor may choose not to test for asbestos if the contractor follows the notification and work practice requirements of the NESHAP.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. A/C Shingle Removal (Category II ACM Removal)</HD>
              <P>1.B.1. A/C shingles, which are Category II nonfriable ACM, become regulated ACM if the material has a high probability of becoming or has become crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by the forces expected to act on the material in the course of demolition or renovation operations. 40 CFR 61.141. However, merely breaking an A/C shingle (or any other category II ACM) that is not friable may not necessarily cause the material to become RACM. A/C shingles are typically nailed to buildings on which they are attached. EPA believes that the extent of breakage that will normally result from carefully removing A/C shingles and lowering the shingles to the ground will not result in crumbling, pulverizing or reducing the shingles to powder. Conversely, the extent of breakage that will normally occur if the A/C shingles are dropped from a building or scraped off of a building with heavy machinery would cause the shingles to become RACM. EPA therefore construes the NESHAP to mean that the removal of A/C shingles that are not friable, using methods that do not crumble, pulverize, or reduce the A/C shingles to powder (such as pry bars, spud bars and shovels to carefully pry the material), is not subject to the NESHAP provided that the A/C shingles are properly handled during and after removal, as discussed in this paragraph and the asbestos NESHAP. This interpretation also applies to other Category II nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing materials.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Cutting vs. Slicing and Manual Methods for Removal of Category I ACM</HD>
              <P>1.C.1. Because of damage to the roofing material, and the potential for fiber release, roof removal operations using rotating blade (RB) roof cutters or other equipment that sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material are subject to the NESHAP. As EPA interprets the NESHAP, the use of certain manual methods (using equipment such as axes, hatchets, or knives, spud bars, pry bars, and shovels, but not saws) or methods that slice, shear, or punch (using equipment such as a power slicer or power plow) does not constitute “cutting, sanding, grinding or abrading.” This is because these methods do not destroy the structural matrix or integrity of the material such that the material is crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder. Hence, it is EPA's interpretation that when such methods are used, assuming the roof material is not friable, the removal operation is not subject to the regulation.</P>
              <P>1.C.2. Power removers or power tear-off machines are typically used to pry the roofing material up from the deck after the roof membrane has been cut. It is EPA's interpretation that when these machines are used to pry roofing material up, their use is not regulated by the NESHAP.</P>

              <P>1.C.3. As noted previously, the NESHAP only applies to the removal of asbestos-containing roofing materials. Thus, the NESHAP does not apply to the use of RB cutters to remove non-asbestos built up roofing (BUR). On roofs containing some asbestos-containing and some non-asbestos-containing materials, coverage under the NESHAP depends on the methods used to remove each type of material in addition to other coverage thresholds specified above. For example, it is not uncommon for existing roofs to be made of non-asbestos BUR and base flashings that do contain asbestos. In that situation, EPA construes the <PRTPAGE P="128"/>NESHAP to be inapplicable to the removal of the non-asbestos BUR using an RB cutter so long as the RB cutter is not used to cut 5580 ft<SU>2</SU> or more of the asbestos-containing base flashing or other asbestos-containing material into sections. In addition, the use of methods that slice, shear, punch or pry could then be used to remove the asbestos flashings and not trigger coverage under the NESHAP.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">II. Notification</HD>
              <P>2.1. Notification for a demolition is always required under the NESHAP. However, EPA believes that few roof removal jobs constitute “demolitions” as defined in the NESHAP (§ 61.141). In particular, it is EPA's view that the removal of roofing systems (i.e., the roof membrane, insulation, surfacing, coatings, flashings, mastic, shingles, and felt underlayment), when such removal is not a part of a demolition project, constitutes a “renovation” under the NESHAP. If the operation is a renovation, and Category I roofing material is being removed using either manual methods or slicing, notification is not required by the NESHAP. If Category II material is not friable and will be removed without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, no notification is required. Also, if the renovation involves less than the threshold area for applicability as discussed above, then no notification is required. However, if a roof removal meets the applicability and threshold requirements under the NESHAP, then EPA (or the delegated agency) must be notified in advance of the removal in accordance with the requirements of § 61.145(b), as follows:</P>
              <P>• Notification must be given in writing at least 10 working days in advance and must include the information in § 61.145(b)(4), except for emergency renovations as discussed below.</P>
              <P>• The notice must be updated as necessary, including, for example, when the amount of asbestos-containing roofing material reported changes by 20 percent or more.</P>
              <P>• EPA must be notified if the start date of the roof removal changes. If the start date of a roof removal project is changed to an earlier date, EPA must be provided with a written notice of the new start date at least 10 working days in advance. If the start date changes to a later date, EPA must be notified by telephone as soon as possible before the original start date and a written notice must be sent as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>• For emergency renovations (as defined in § 61.141), where work must begin immediately to avoid safety or public health hazards, equipment damage, or unreasonable financial burden, the notification must be postmarked or delivered to EPA as soon as possible, but no later than the following work day.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">III. Emission Control Practices</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. Requirements To Adequately Wet and Discharge No Visible Emission</HD>
              <P>3.A.1. The principal controls contained in the NESHAP for removal operations include requirements that the affected material be adequately wetted, and that asbestos waste be handled, collected, and disposed of properly. The requirements for disposal of waste materials are discussed separately in section IV below. The emission control requirements discussed in this section III apply only to roof removal operations that are covered by the NESHAP as set forth in Section I above.</P>
              <P>3.A.2. For any operation subject to the NESHAP, the regulation (§§ 61.145(c)(2)(i), (3), (6)(i)) requires that RACM be adequately wet (as defined in § 61.141) during the operation that damages or disturbs the asbestos material until collected for disposal.</P>
              <P>3.A.3. When using an RB roof cutter (or any other method that sands, grinds, cuts or abrades the roofing material) to remove Category I asbestos-containing roofing material, the emission control requirements of § 61.145(c) apply as discussed in Section I above. EPA will consider a roof removal project to be in compliance with the “adequately wet” and “discharge no visible emission” requirements of the NESHAP if the RB roof cutter is equipped and operated with the following: (1) a blade guard that completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface; and (2) a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and which device is in operation during the cutting of the roof.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Exemptions From Wetting Requirements</HD>
              <P>3.B.1. The NESHAP provides that, in certain instances, wetting may not be required during the cutting of Category I asbestos roofing material with an RB roof cutter. If EPA determines in accordance with § 61.145(c)(3)(i), that wetting will unavoidably damage the building, equipment inside the building, or will present a safety hazard while stripping the ACM from a facility component that remains in place, the roof removal operation will be exempted from the requirement to wet during cutting. EPA must have sufficient written information on which to base such a decision. Before proceeding with a dry removal, the contractor must have received EPA's written approval. Such exemptions will be made on a case-by-case basis.</P>

              <P>3.B.2. It is EPA's view that, in most instances, exemptions from the wetting requirements are not necessary. Where EPA grants an exemption from wetting because of the potential for damage to the building, damage to equipment within the building or a safety hazard, the NESHAP specifies alternative control methods (§ 61.145(c)(3)(i)(B)). <PRTPAGE P="129"/>Alternative control methods include (a) the use of local exhaust ventilation systems that capture the dust, and do not produce visible emissions, or (b) methods that are designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of § 61.152, or (c) other methods that have received the written approval of EPA. EPA will consider an alternative emission control method in compliance with the NESHAP if the method has received written approval from EPA and the method is being implemented consistent with the approved procedures (§ 61.145(c)(3)(ii) or § 61.152(b)(3)).</P>
              <P>3.B.3. An exemption from wetting is also allowed when the air or roof surface temperature at the point of wetting is below freezing, as specified in § 61.145(c)(7). If freezing temperatures are indicated as the reason for not wetting, records must be kept of the temperature at the beginning, middle and end of the day on which wetting is not performed and the records of temperature must be retained for at least 2 years. 42 CFR § 61.145(c)(7)(iii). It is EPA's interpretation that in such cases, no written application to, or written approval by the Administrator is needed for using emission control methods listed in § 61.145(c)(3)(i)(B), or alternative emission control methods that have been previously approved by the Administrator. However, such written application or approval is required for alternative emission control methods that have not been previously approved. Any dust and debris collected from cutting must still be kept wet and placed in containers. All of the other requirements for notification and waste disposal would continue to apply as described elsewhere in this notice and the Asbestos NESHAP.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">C. Waste Collection and Handling</HD>
              <P>3.C.1. It is EPA's interpretation that waste resulting from slicing and other methods that do not cut, grind, sand or abrade Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material is not subject to the NESHAP and can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste. EPA further construes the NESHAP to provide that if Category II roofing material (such as A/C shingles) is removed and disposed of without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, the waste from the removal is not subject to the NESHAP waste disposal requirements. EPA also interprets the NESHAP to be inapplicable to waste resulting from roof removal operations that do not meet or exceed the coverage thresholds described in section I above. Of course, other State, local, or Federal regulations may apply.</P>

              <P>3.C.2. It is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter, or other method that similarly damages the roofing material, is used to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the damaged material from the cut (the sawdust or debris) is considered asbestos containing waste subject to § 61.150 of the NESHAP, provided the coverage thresholds discussed above in section 1 are met or exceeded. This sawdust or debris must be disposed of at a disposal site operated in accordance with the NESHAP. It is also EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if the remainder of the roof is free of the sawdust and debris generated by the cutting, or if such sawdust or debris is collected as discussed below in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4, 3.C.5 and 3.C.6, the remainder of the roof can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste because it is considered to be Category I nonfriable material (as long as the remainder of the roof is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material). EPA further believes that if the roof is not cleaned of such sawdust or debris, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> it is contaminated, then it must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and be handled in accordance with § 61.150.</P>

              <P>3.C.3. In order to be in compliance with the NESHAP while using an RB roof cutter (or device that similarly damages the roofing material) to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the dust and debris resulting from the cutting of the roof should be collected as soon as possible after the cutting operation, and kept wet until collected and placed in leak-tight containers. EPA believes that where the blade guard completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface and is equipped with a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and the spraying device is in operation during the cutting, most of the dust and debris from cutting will be confined along the cut. The most efficient methods to collect the dust and debris from cutting are to immediately collect or vacuum up the damaged material where it lies along the cut using a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the debris as possible, or to gently sweep up the bulk of the debris, and then use a filtered vacuum cleaner that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the remainder of the debris as possible. On smooth surfaced roofs (nonaggregate roofs), sweeping up the debris and then wet wiping the surface may be done in place of using a filtered vacuum cleaner. It is EPA's view that if these decontamination procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste. Additionally, it is EPA's view that where such decontamination procedures are followed, if the remaining portions of the roof are non-asbestos or Category I nonfriable asbestos material, and if the remaining portions are removed using removal methods that slice, shear, punch or <PRTPAGE P="130"/>pry, as discussed in section 1.C above, then the remaining portions do not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste and the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements are not applicable to the removal of the remaining portions. In EPA's interpretation, the failure of a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector to collect larger chunks or pieces of damaged roofing material created by the RB roof cutter does not require the remaining roofing material to be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste, provided that such visible chunks or pieces of roofing material are collected (e.g. by gentle sweeping) and disposed of as asbestos waste. Other methods of decontamination may not be adequate, and should be approved by the local delegated agency.</P>
              <P>3.C.4. In EPA's interpretation, if the debris from the cutting is not collected immediately, it will be necessary to lightly mist the dust or debris, until it is collected, as discussed above, and placed in containers. The dust or debris should be lightly misted frequently enough to prevent the material from drying, and to prevent airborne emissions, prior to collection as described above. It is EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if these procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste, as long as the remaining roof material is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material.</P>

              <P>3.C.5. It is EPA's interpretation that, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided the roofing material has not been made friable by the cutting operation, the appearance of rough, jagged or damaged edges on the remaining roofing material, due to the use of an RB roof cutter, does not require that such remaining roofing material be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste. In addition, it is also EPA's interpretation that if the sawdust or debris generated by the use of an RB roof cutter has been collected as discussed in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4 and 3.C.6, the presence of dust along the edge of the remaining roof material does not render such material “friable” for purposes of this interpretive rule or the NESHAP, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided that the remaining roofing material near the cutline has not been made friable by the cutting operation. Where roofing material near the cutline has been made friable by the use of the RB cutter (<E T="03">i.e.</E> where such remaining roofing material near the cutline can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder using hand pressure), it is EPA's interpretation that the use of an encapsulant will ensure that such friable material need not be treated or disposed of as asbestos containing waste material. The encapsulant may be applied to the friable material after the roofing material has been collected into stacks for subsequent disposal as nonasbestos waste. It is EPA's view that if the encapsulation procedure set forth in this paragraph is followed in operations where roofing material near the cutline has been rendered friable by the use of an RB roof cutter, and if the decontamination procedures set forth in paragraph 3.C.3 have been followed, the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements would be met for the removal, handling and disposal of the remaining roofing material.</P>
              <P>3.C.6. As one way to comply with the NESHAP, the dust and debris from cutting can be placed in leak-tight containers, such as plastic bags, and the containers labeled using warning labels required by OSHA (29 CFR 1926.58). In addition, the containers must have labels that identify the waste generator (such as the name of the roofing contractor, abatement contractor, and/or building owner or operator) and the location of the site at which the waste was generated.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">IV. Waste Disposal</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">A. Disposal Requirements</HD>
              <P>4.A.1. Section 61.150(b) requires that, as soon as is practical, all collected dust and debris from cutting as well as any contaminated roofing squares, must be taken to a landfill that is operated in accordance with § 61.154 or to an EPA-approved site that converts asbestos waste to nonasbestos material in accordance with § 61.155. During the loading and unloading of affected waste, asbestos warning signs must be affixed to the vehicles.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">B. Waste Shipment Record</HD>
              <P>4.B.1. For each load of asbestos waste that is regulated under the NESHAP, a waste shipment record (WSR) must be maintained in accordance with § 61.150(d). Information that must be maintained for each waste load includes the following:</P>
              <P>• Name, address, and telephone number of the waste generator</P>
              <P>• Name and address of the local, State, or EPA regional office responsible for administering the asbestos NESHAP program</P>
              <P>• Quantity of waste in cubic meters (or cubic yards)</P>
              <P>• Name and telephone number of the disposal site operator</P>
              <P>• Name and physical site location of the disposal site</P>
              <P>• Date transported</P>
              <P>• Name, address, and telephone number of the transporter(s)</P>

              <P>• Certification that the contents meet all government regulations for transport by highways.<PRTPAGE P="131"/>
              </P>
              <P>4.B.2. The waste generator is responsible for ensuring that a copy of the WSR is delivered to the disposal site along with the waste shipment. If a copy of the WSR signed by the disposal site operator is not returned to the waste generator within 35 days, the waste generator must contact the transporter and/or the disposal site to determine the status of the waste shipment. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(3). If the signed WSR is not received within 45 days, the waste generator must report, in writing, to the responsible NESHAP program agency and send along a copy of the WSR. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(4). Copies of WSRs, including those signed by the disposal site operator, must be retained for at least 2 years. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(5).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">V. Training</HD>
              <P>5.1. For those roof removals that are subject to the NESHAP, at least one on-site supervisor trained in the provisions of the NESHAP must be present during the removal of the asbestos roofing material. 40 CFR 61.145(c)(8). In EPA's view, this person can be a job foreman, a hired consultant, or someone who can represent the building owner or contractor responsible for the removal. In addition to the initial training requirement, a refresher training course is required every 2 years. The NESHAP training requirements became effective on November 20, 1991.</P>
              <P>5.2. Asbestos training courses developed specifically to address compliance with the NESHAP in roofing work, as well as courses developed for other purposes can satisfy this requirement of the NESHAP, as long as the course covers the areas specified in the regulation. EPA believes that Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) training courses will, for example, satisfy the NESHAP training requirements. However, nothing in this interpretive rule or in the NESHAP shall be deemed to require that roofing contractors or roofing workers performing operations covered by the NESHAP must be trained or accredited under AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). Likewise, state or local authorities may independently impose additional training, licensing, or accreditation requirements on roofing contractors performing operations covered by the NESHAP, but such additional training, licensing or accreditation is not called for by this interpretive rule or the federal NESHAP.</P>
              <P>5.3. For removal of Category I asbestos containing roofing material where RB roof cutters or equipment that similarly damages the asbestos-containing roofing material are used, the NESHAP training requirements (§ 61.145(c)(8)) apply as discussed in Section I above. It is EPA's intention that removal of Category I asbestos-containing roofing material using hatchets, axes, knives, and/or the use of spud bars, pry bars and shovels to lift the roofing material, or similar removal methods that slice, punch, or shear the roof membrane are not subject to the training requirements, since these methods do not cause the roof removal to be subject to the NESHAP. Likewise, it is EPA's intention that roof removal operations involving Category II nonfriable ACM are not subject to the training requirements where such operations are not subject to the NESHAP as discussed in section I above.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standard for new and existing sources.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of paragraphs (b)-(f) of this section do not apply to any copper converter at a facility where the total arsenic charging rate for the copper converter department averaged over a 1-year period is less than 75 kg/hr (165 lb/hr), as determined under § 61.174(f).</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator of each copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall reduce inorganic arsenic emissions to the atmosphere by meeting the following design, equipment, work practice, and operational requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Install, operate, and maintain a secondary hood system on each copper converter. Each secondary hood system shall consist of a hood enclosure, air curtain fan(s), exhaust system fan(s), and ductwork that conveys the captured emissions to a control device, and shall meet the following specifications:</P>
              <P>(i) The configuration and dimensions of the hood enclosure shall be such that the copper converter mouth, charging ladles, skimming ladles, and any other material transfer vessels used will be housed within the confines or influence of the hood enclosure during each mode of copper converter operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) The back of the hood enclosure shall be fully enclosed and sealed against the primary hood. Portions of the side-walls in contact with the copper converter shall be sealed against the converter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Openings in the top and front of the hood enclosure to allow for the entry and egress of ladles and crane appartus shall be minimized to the fullest extent practicable.</P>
              <P>(iv) The hood enclosure shall be fabricated in such a manner and of materials of sufficient strength to withstand incidental contact with ladles and crane apparatus with no significant damage.</P>
              <P>(v) One side-wall of the hood enclosure shall be equipped with a horizontal-slotted plenum along the top, and the opposite side-wall shall be equipped with an exhaust hood. The horizontal-slotted plenum shall be designed to allow the distance from the base to the top of the horizontal slot to be adjustable up to a dimension of 76 mm.</P>
              <P>(vi) The horizontal-slotted plenum shall be connected to a fan. When activated, the fan shall push air through the horizontal slot, producing a horizontal air curtain above the copper converter that is directed to the exhaust hood. The fan power output installed shall be sufficient to overcome static pressure losses through the ductwork upstream of the horizontal-slotted plenum and across the plenum, and to deliver at least 22,370 watts (30 air horsepower) at the horizontal-slotted plenum discharge.</P>
              <P>(vii) The exhaust hood shall be sized to completely intercept the airstream from the horizontal-slotted plenum combined with the additional airflow resulting from entrainment of the surrounding air. The exhaust hood shall be connected to a fan. When activated, the fan shall pull the combined airstream into the exhaust hood.</P>
              <P>(viii) The entire secondary hood system shall be equipped with dampers and instrumentation, as appropriate, so that the desired air curtain and exhaust flow are maintained during each mode of copper converter operation.</P>
              <P>(2) Optimize the capture of secondary inorganic arsenic emissions by operating the copper converter and secondary hood system at all times as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Copper converter.</E> (A) Increase the air curtain and exhaust flow rates to their optimum conditions prior to raising the primary hood and rolling the copper converter out for charging, skimming, or pouring.<PRTPAGE P="140"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) Once rolled out, prior to the commencement of skimming or pouring, hold the copper converter in an idle position until fuming from the molten bath has been minimized.</P>
              <P>(C) During skimming, raise the receiving ladle off the ground and position the ladle as close to the copper converter mouth as possible to minimize the drop distance between the converter mouth and the receiving ladle.</P>
              <P>(D) Control the rate of flow into the receiving ladle to the extent practicable to minimize fuming.</P>
              <P>(E) Upon the completion of each charge, withdraw the charging ladle or vessel used from the confines of the secondary hood in a slow, deliberate manner.</P>
              <P>(F) During charging, skimming, or pouring, ensure that the crane block does not disturb the air flow between the horizontal-slotted plenum and the exhaust hood.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Secondary hood system.</E> (A) Operate the secondary hood system under conditions that will result in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions.</P>
              <P>(B) Within 30 days after the effective date of this subpart, or within 30 days after the initial operation of each secondary hood system, whichever comes later, provide to the Administrator a list of operating conditions for the secondary hood system that will result in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions.

              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The distance from the horizontal slot to the exhaust hood.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The face velocity at the opening of the exhaust hood during each mode of converter operation.</P>
              <P>(C) Operate the secondary hood system under the conditions listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(D) Notify the Administrator in writing within 30 days if there is any change in the operating conditions submitted pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) that will result in any reduction in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions.</P>

              <P>(c) No owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause or allow to be discharged into the atmosphere any copper converter secondary emissions that exit from a control device and contain particulate matter in excess of 11.6 mg/dscm (0.0051 gr/dscf).</P>
              <P>(d) The owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall submit a description of a plan for control of inorganic arsenic emissions from the copper converter and associated air pollution control equipment. This plan shall be submitted within 90 days after the effective date of this subpart, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11. If a waiver of compliance is granted, the plan shall be submitted on a date set by the Administrator. Approval of the plan will be granted by the Administrator provided he finds that:</P>

This notification shall include a statement of the grounds for such a petition and this notice requirement may be satisfied by, but is not limited to, submissions or pleadings submitted to NRC during a proceeding conducted by NRC.</P>
              <P>(3) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(a)(2) (site-specific basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner demonstrates that a written request was made to NRC or an affected Agreement State for enforcement or other relief at least 60 days before filing its petition with EPA, and unless the petitioner alleges that NRC or the affected Agreement State failed to respond to such request by taking action, as necessary, to assure timely implementation and enforcement of the 20 pCi/m <SU>2</SU>-s flux standard.</P>
              <P>(4) Upon receipt of a petition under § 61.226(b)(1) that is not dismissed under § 61.226(b)(2) or (b)(3), EPA will propose to grant or deny an authorized petition to reconsider, take comments on the Agency's proposed action, and take final action granting or denying such petition to reconsider within 300 days of receipt.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reconsideration of rescission of this subpart initiated by the Administrator.</E> (1) The Administrator may initiate reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if EPA has reason to believe that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m <SU>2</SU>-s flux standard.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act or 40 CFR part 61, subpart A. The following terms shall have the following specific meanings:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Area</E> means the vertical projection of the pile upon the earth's surface.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuous disposal</E> means a method of uranium byproduct material or tailings management and disposal in which uranium byproduct material or tailings are dewatered by mechanical methods immediately after generation. The dried uranium byproduct material or tailings are then placed in trenches or other disposal areas and immediately covered to limit emissions consistent with applicable Federal standards.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Dewatered</E> means to remove the water from recently produced uranium byproduct material or tailings by mechanical or evaporative methods such that the water content of the uranium byproduct material or tailings does not exceed 30 percent by weight.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Existing conventional impoundment</E> means any conventional uranium byproduct material or tailings impoundment which is licensed to accept additional uranium byproduct material or tailings and is in existence on December 15, 1989.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Operation.</E> Operation means that an impoundment is being used for the continued placement of uranium byproduct material or tailings or is in standby status for such placement. An impoundment is in operation from the day that uranium byproduct material or tailings are first placed in the impoundment until the day that final closure begins.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Phased disposal</E> means a method of uranium byproduct material or tailings management and disposal which uses lined impoundments which are filled and then immediately dried and covered to meet all applicable Federal standards.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Uranium byproduct material or tailings</E> means the waste produced by the extraction or concentration of uranium from any ore processed primarily for its source material content. Ore bodies depleted by uranium solution extraction and which remain underground do not constitute byproduct material for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Conventional impoundment.</E> A conventional impoundment is a permanent structure located at any uranium recovery facility which contains mostly solid uranium byproduct material or tailings from the extraction of uranium from uranium ore. These impoundments are left in place at facility closure.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Non-conventional impoundment.</E> A non-conventional impoundment is used for managing liquids from uranium recovery operations and contains uranium byproduct material or tailings suspended in and/or covered by liquids. These structures are commonly known as holding ponds or evaporation ponds and can be located at any uranium recovery facility. They are typically not permanent structures unless they transition to become used as conventional impoundments. Impoundments constructed for the purpose of managing <PRTPAGE P="175"/>liquids from closure or remediation activities (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> contaminated groundwater), and which are used solely for that purpose, are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Heap leach pile.</E> A heap leach pile is a pile of uranium ore placed on an engineered structure and stacked so as to allow uranium to be dissolved and removed by leaching liquids.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Standby.</E> Standby means the period of time that an impoundment is not accepting uranium byproduct material or tailings but has not yet entered final closure.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Uranium recovery facility.</E> A uranium recovery facility means a facility licensed by the NRC or an NRC Agreement State to manage uranium byproduct material or tailings during and following the processing of uranium ores. Common names for these facilities are a conventional uranium mill, an in-situ leach (or recovery) facility and a heap leach facility or pile.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Heap leach pile operational life.</E> The operational life of a heap leach pile means the time period from the first time that lixiviant is placed on the heap leach pile until the time the final rinse is completed.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Final closure</E> means the period during which an impoundment or heap leach pile is being managed in accordance with the milestones and requirements in an approved reclamation plan. Final closure for the impoundment or heap leach pile begins when the owner or operator provides written notice to the Administrator and to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or applicable NRC Agreement State that:</P>
              <P>(1) A conventional impoundment is no longer receiving uranium byproduct material or tailings, is no longer on standby for such receipt and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that impoundment or facility closure plan; or</P>
              <P>(2) A non-conventional impoundment is no longer required for evaporation or holding purposes, is no longer on standby for such purposes and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that impoundment or facility closure plan; or</P>
              <P>(3) A heap leach pile has concluded its operational life and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that pile or facility closure plan.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Reclamation plan</E> means the plan detailing activities and milestones to accomplish reclamation of impoundments or piles containing uranium byproduct material or tailings. Activities and milestones to be addressed include, but are not limited to, dewatering and contouring of conventional impoundments and heap leach piles, and removal and disposal of non-conventional impoundments. A reclamation plan prepared and approved in accordance with 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A is considered a reclamation plan in this subpart.</P>

Except for automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents, roof drains, and leg sleeves, each opening in the roof is to be equipped with a gasketed cover, seal or lid which is to be maintained in a closed position at all times (i.e., no visible gap) except when the device is in actual use. Automatic bleeder vents are to be closed at all times when the roof is floating, except when the roof is being floated off or is being landed on the roof leg supports. Rim vents are to be set to open when the roof is being floated off the roof leg supports or at the manufacturer's recommended setting. Automatic bleeder vents and rim space vents are to be gasketed. Each emergency roof drain is to be provided with a slotted membrane fabric cover that covers at <PRTPAGE P="180"/>least 90 percent of the area of the opening.</P>
              <P>(4) The roof shall be floating on the liquid at all times (i.e., off the roof leg supports) except during initial fill until the roof is lifted off leg supports and when the vessel is completely emptied and subsequently refilled. The process of emptying and refilling when the roof is resting on the leg supports shall be continuous and shall be accomplished as rapidly as possible.</P>
              <P>(5) The requirement for a secondary seal does not apply to each existing storage vessel that was equipped with a liquid-mounted primary seal as of July 28, 1988, until after the first time after September 14, 1989, when the vessel is emptied and degassed or 10 years from September 14, 1989, whichever occurs first.</P>
              <P>(c) The storage vessel shall be equipped with a closed vent system and a control device.</P>
              <P>(1) The closed vent system shall be designed to collect all benzene vapors and gases discharged from the storage vessel and operated with no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background and visual inspections, as determined in § 61.242-11 (subpart V).</P>
              <P>(2) The control device shall be designed and operated to reduce inlet benzene emissions by 95 percent or greater. If a flare is used as the control device, it shall meet the specifications described in the general control device requirements of 40 CFR 60.18.</P>
              <P>(3) The specifications and requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section for closed vent systems and control devices do not apply during periods of routine maintenance. During periods of routine maintenance, the benzene level in the storage vessel(s) serviced by the control device subject to the provisions of § 61.271(c) may be lowered but not raised. Periods of routine maintenance shall not exceed 72 hours as outlined in the maintenance plan required by § 61.272(c)(1)(iii).</P>
              <P>(4) The specifications and requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section for closed vents and control devices do not apply during a control system malfunction. A control system malfunction means any sudden and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment. A failure caused entirely or in part by design deficiencies, poor maintenance, careless operation, or other preventable upset condition or equipment breakdown is not considered a malfunction.</P>
              <P>(d) The owner or operator of each affected storage vessel shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section or § 61.270(g) as follows:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For each vessel complying with § 61.271(a) (fixed roof and internal floating roof) each owner or operator shall:</P>
              <P>(1) After installing the control equipment required to comply with § 61.271(a), visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service), prior to filling the storage vessel with benzene. If there are holes, tears or other openings in the primary seal, the secondary seal, or the seal fabric, or defects in the internal floating roof, the owner or operator shall repair the items before filling the storage vessel.</P>

              <P>(2) Visually inspect the internal floating roof and the primary seal or <PRTPAGE P="181"/>the secondary seal (if one is in service) through manholes and roof hatches on the fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial fill, or at least once every 12 months after September 14, 1989, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. If the internal floating roof is not resting on the surface of the benzene liquid inside the storage vessel, or there is liquid on the roof, or the seal is detached, or there are holes or tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days. If a failure that is detected during inspections required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, an extension of up to 30 additional days may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report required in § 61.275(a). Such a request for an extension must document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable and specify a schedule of actions the company will take that will ensure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(3) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes and sleeve seals (if any) each time the storage vessel is emptied and degassed. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of vessels conducting the annual visual inspections as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and at intervals greater than 5 years in the case of vessels specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For all the inspections required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to the refilling of each storage vessel to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If the inspection required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the vessel, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, the notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to refilling.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the internal floating roof has defects, the primary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the gaskets no longer close off the liquid surfaces from the atmosphere, or the slotted membrane has more than 10 percent open area, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before refilling the storage vessel with benzene.</P>
              <P>(4) For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in § 61.271(a)(2)(ii):</P>
              <P>(i) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section at least every 5 years; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Visually inspect the vessel annually as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and at least every 10 years as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) For each vessel complying with § 61.271(b) (external floating roof) the owner or operator shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the primary seal and the wall of the storage vessel, and the secondary seal and the wall of the storage vessel according to the following frequency.</P>

              <P>(i) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic testing of the vessel or within 90 days of the initial fill with benzene or within 90 days of September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at least once every 5 years thereafter, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="182"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with a liquid-mounted primary seal and without a secondary seal as provided for in § 61.271(b)(5), measurement of gaps between the vessel wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed within 90 days of September 14, 1989, and at least once per year thereafter. When a secondary seal is installed over the primary seal, measurement of primary seal gaps shall be performed within 90 days of installation and at least once every 5 years thereafter.</P>
              <P>(iii) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the secondary seal shall be performed within 90 days of the initial fill with benzene, within 90 days of installation of the secondary seal, or within 90 days after September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at least once per year thereafter.</P>
              <P>(iv) If any source ceases to store benzene for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of benzene into the vessel shall be considered an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Determine gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary seals individually by the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(i) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.</P>
              <P>(ii) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the vessel in each place where a 0.32 centimeter (cm) (1/8 in) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the storage vessel and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.</P>

              <P>(a) An owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is less than 10 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (11 ton/yr) shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is the sum of the annual benzene quantity for each waste stream at the facility that has a flow-weighted annual average water content greater than 10 percent or that is mixed with water, or other wastes, at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent. The benzene quantity in a waste stream is to be counted only once without multiple counting if other waste streams are mixed with or generated from the original waste stream. Other specific requirements for calculating the total annual benzene waste quantity are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Wastes that are exempted from control under §§ 61.342(c)(2) and 61.342(c)(3) are included in the calculation of the total annual benzene quantity if they have an annual average water content greater than 10 percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) The benzene in a material subject to this subpart that is sold is included in the calculation of the total annual benzene quantity if the material has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.</P>

              <P>(3) Benzene in wastes generated by remediation activities conducted at the facility, such as the excavation of contaminated soil, pumping and treatment of groundwater, and the recovery of product from soil or groundwater, are not included in the calculation of total annual benzene quantity for that facility. If the facility's total annual benzene quantity is 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) or more, wastes generated by remediation activities are subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section. If the facility is managing remediation waste generated offsite, the benzene in this waste shall be included in the calculation of total annual benzene quantity in facility waste, if the waste streams have an annual average water content greater than 10 percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.<PRTPAGE P="201"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The total annual benzene quantity is determined based upon the quantity of benzene in the waste before any waste treatment occurs to remove the benzene except as specified in § 61.355(c)(1)(i) (A) through (C).</P>
              <P>(b) Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall be in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section no later than 90 days following the effective date, unless a waiver of compliance has been obtained under § 61.11, or by the initial startup for a new source with an initial startup after the effective date.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with the rule within the required time may request a waiver of compliance under § 61.10.</P>
              <P>(2) As part of the waiver application, the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a plan under § 61.10(b)(3) that is an enforceable commitment to obtain environmental benefits to mitigate the benzene emissions that result from extending the compliance date. The plan shall include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the method of compliance, including the control approach, schedule for installing controls, and quantity of the benzene emissions that result from extending the compliance date;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the control approach involves a compliance strategy designed to obtain integrated compliance with multiple regulatory requirements, a description of the other regulations involved and their effective dates; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of the actions to be taken at the facility to obtain mitigating environmental benefits, including how the benefits will be obtained, the schedule for these actions, and an estimate of the quantifiable benefits that directly result from these actions.</P>
              <P>(c) Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall manage and treat the facility waste as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For each waste stream that contains benzene, including (but not limited to) organic waste streams that contain less than 10 percent water and aqueous waste streams, even if the wastes are not discharged to an individual drain system, the owner or operator shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Remove or destroy the benzene contained in the waste using a treatment process or wastewater treatment system that complies with the standards specified in § 61.348 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) Comply with the standards specified in §§ 61.343 through 61.347 of this subpart for each waste management unit that receives or manages the waste stream prior to and during treatment of the waste stream in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Each waste management unit used to manage or treat waste streams that will be recycled to a process shall comply with the standards specified in §§ 61.343 through 61.347. Once the waste stream is recycled to a process, including to a tank used for the storage of production process feed, product, or product intermediates, unless this tank is used primarily for the storage of wastes, the material is no longer subject to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) A waste stream is exempt from paragraph (c)(1) of this section provided that the owner or operator demonstrates initially and, thereafter, at least once per year that the flow-weighted annual average benzene concentration for the waste stream is less than 10 ppmw as determined by the procedures specified in § 61.355(c)(2) or § 61.355(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(3) A waste stream is exempt from paragraph (c)(1) of this section provided that the owner or operator demonstrates initially and, thereafter, at least once per year that the conditions specified in either paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (c)(3)(ii) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(i) The waste stream is process wastewater that has a flow rate less than 0.02 liters per minute (0.005 gallons per minute) or an annual wastewater quantity of less than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr); or</P>
              <P>(ii) All of the following conditions are met:<PRTPAGE P="202"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) The owner or operator does not choose to exempt process wastewater under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section,</P>
              <P>(B) The total annual benzene quantity in all waste streams chosen for exemption in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section does not exceed 2.0 Mg/yr (2.2 ton/yr) as determined in the procedures in § 61.355(j), and</P>
              <P>(C) The total annual benzene quantity in a waste stream chosen for exemption, including process unit turnaround waste, is determined for the year in which the waste is generated.</P>
              <P>(d) As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, an owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section may elect to manage and treat the facility waste as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall manage and treat facility waste other than process wastewater in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator shall manage and treat process wastewater in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Process wastewater shall be treated to achieve a total annual benzene quantity from facility process wastewater less than 1 Mg/yr (1.1 ton/yr).

              <P>8.2.2 Perform test runs such that samples are obtained over a period or periods that accurately determine the maximum emissions that occur in a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, run sufficient tests for the accurate determination of the emissions that <PRTPAGE P="244"/>occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sample time of 2 hours is recommended. In some instances, high Hg or high SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations make it impossible to sample for the desired minimum time. This is indicated by reddening (liberation of free iodine) in the first impinger. In these cases, the sample run may be divided into two or more subruns to ensure that the absorbing solution is not depleted.</P>
              <P>8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.</P>

              <P>8.3.1 Clean all glassware (probe, impingers, and connectors) by rinsing with 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, tap water, 0.1 M ICl, tap water, and finally deionized distilled water. Place 100 ml of 0.1 M ICl in each of the first three impingers. Take care to prevent the absorbing solution from contacting any greased surfaces. Place approximately 200 g of preweighed silica gel in the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be used, but care should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and carried out from the impinger during sampling. Place the silica gel container in a clean place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, determine and record the weight of the silica gel plus impinger to the nearest 0.5 g.</P>
              <P>8.3.2 Install the selected nozzle using a Viton A O-ring when stack temperatures are less than 260 °C (500 °F). Use a fiberglass string gasket if temperatures are higher. See APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in Method 5) for details. Other connecting systems using either 316 stainless steel or Teflon ferrules may be used. Mark the probe with heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.</P>

              <P>8.3.3 Assemble the train as shown in Figure 101-1, using (if necessary) a very light coat of silicone grease on all ground glass joints. Grease only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) to avoid the possibility of contamination by the silicone grease.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>An empty impinger may be inserted between the third impinger and the silica gel to remove excess moisture from the sample stream.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>8.3.4 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the probe heating system, if applicable, at the desired operating temperature. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed ice around the impingers.</P>
              <P>8.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Follow the leak-check procedures outlined in Method 5, Section 8.4.</P>
              <P>8.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the general procedure outlined in Method 5, Section 8.5. For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 101-4.</P>

              <P>8.7 Sample Recovery. Begin proper cleanup procedure as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period.</P>
              <P>8.7.1 Allow the probe to cool. When it can be safely handled, wipe off any external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle, and place a cap over it. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling. Capping would create a vacuum and draw liquid out from the impingers.</P>
              <P>8.7.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the train, wipe off the silicone grease, and cap the open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Wipe off the silicone grease from the impinger. Use either ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps to close these openings.</P>
              <P>8.7.3 Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to a cleanup area that is clean, protected from the wind, and free of Hg contamination. The ambient air in laboratories located in the immediate vicinity of Hg-using facilities is not normally free of Hg contamination.</P>
              <P>8.7.4 Inspect the train before and during disassembly, and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows.</P>
              <P>8.7.4.1 Container No. 1 (Impingers and Probe).</P>

              <P>8.7.4.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure the liquid in the first three impingers to within 1 ml. Record the volume of liquid present (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> see Figure 5-6 of Method 5). This information is needed to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. (Use only glass storage bottles and graduated cylinders that have been precleaned as in Section 8.3.1) Place the contents of the first three impingers into a 1000-ml glass sample bottle.</P>
              <P>8.7.4.1.2 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover the Hg (and any condensate) from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, and probe liner as follows: Rinse these components with two 50-ml portions of 0.1 M ICl. Next, rinse the probe nozzle, fitting and liner, and each piece of connecting glassware between the probe liner and the back half of the third impinger with a maximum of 400 ml of water. Add all washings to the 1000-ml glass sample bottle containing the liquid from the first three impingers.</P>
              <P>8.7.4.1.3 After all washings have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid on the container to prevent leakage during shipment to the laboratory. Mark the height of the liquid to determine later whether leakage occurred during transport. Label the container to identify clearly its contents.</P>

              <P>8.7.4.2 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.<PRTPAGE P="245"/>

              <P>10.3 Aeration System Flow Rate Meter. Assemble the aeration system as shown in Figure 101-5. Set the outlet pressure on the aeration gas cylinder regulator to a minimum pressure of 500 mm Hg (10 psi), and use the flow metering valve and a bubble flowmeter or wet-test meter to obtain a flow rate of 1.5 ±0.1 liters/min (0.053 ±0.0035 cfm) through the aeration cell. After the calibration of the aeration system flow rate meter is complete, remove the bubble flowmeter from the system.</P>
              <P>10.4 Optical Cell Heating System. Using a 50-ml graduated cylinder, add 50 ml of water to the bottle section of the aeration cell, and attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the cell. Attach the aeration cell to the optical cell and while aerating at 1.5 ±0.1 liters/min (0.053 ±0.0035 cfm), determine the minimum variable transformer setting necessary to prevent condensation of moisture in the optical cell and in the connecting tubing.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>The temperature of the solution affects the rate at which elemental Hg is released from a solution and, consequently, it affects the shape of the absorption curve (area) and the point of maximum absorbance (peak height). Therefore, to obtain reproducible results, bring all solutions to room temperature before use.</P>
              </NOTE>
              

              <P>10.5.2 Set the spectrophotometer wavelength at 253.7 nm, and make certain the optical cell is at the minimum temperature that will prevent water condensation. Then set the recorder scale as follows: Using a 50-ml graduated cylinder, add 50 ml of water to the aeration cell bottle. Add three drops of Antifoam B to the bottle, and then pipet 5.0 ml of the working Hg standard solution into the aeration cell.

              <P>10.5.3 Place a Teflon-coated stirring bar in the bottle. Before attaching the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell, make certain that (1) the aeration cell exit arm stopcock (Figure 101-3) is closed (so that Hg will not prematurely enter the optical cell when the reducing agent is being added) and (2) there is no flow through the bubbler. If conditions (1) and (2) are met, attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell. Pipet 5 ml of tin (II) reducing solution into the aeration cell through the side arm, and immediately stopper the side arm. Stir the solution for 15 seconds, turn on the recorder, open the aeration cell exit arm stopcock, and immediately initiate aeration with continued stirring. Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.</P>
              <P>10.6 Calibration Curve.</P>

              <P>10.6.1 After setting the recorder scale, repeat the procedure in Section 10.5 using 0.0-, 1.0-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 4.0-, and 5.0-ml aliquots of the working standard solution (final amount of Hg in the aeration cell is 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ng, respectively). Repeat this procedure on each aliquot size until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>To prevent Hg carryover from one sample to another, do not close the aeration cell from the optical cell until the recorder pen has returned to the baseline.)</P>
              </NOTE>
              

              <P>10.6.2 It should not be necessary to disconnect the aeration gas inlet line from the <PRTPAGE P="246"/>aeration cell when changing samples. After separating the bottle and bubbler sections of the aeration cell, place the bubbler section into a 600-ml beaker containing approximately 400 ml of water. Rinse the bottle section of the aeration cell with a stream of water to remove all traces of the tin (II) reducing agent. Also, to prevent the loss of Hg before aeration, remove all traces of the reducing agent between samples by washing with water. It will be necessary, however, to wash the aeration cell parts with concentrated HCl if any of the following conditions occur: (1) A white film appears on any inside surface of the aeration cell, (2) the calibration curve changes suddenly, or (3) the replicate samples do not yield reproducible results.</P>
              <P>10.6.3 Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank (0.0-ml aliquot)—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak heights of the 1.0-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 4.0-, and 5.0-ml aliquot standards. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Hg contamination of a reagent or carry-over of Hg from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding final total Hg weight in the aeration cell (in ng), and draw the best fit straight line. This line should either pass through the origin or pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. If the line does not pass through or very near to the origin, check for nonlinearity of the curve and for incorrectly prepared standards.</P>

Repeat the procedure used to establish the calibration curve with an appropriately sized aliquot (1 to 5 ml) of the diluted sample (from Section 11.2.2) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. The peak maximum of an aliquot (except the 5-ml aliquot) must be greater than 10 percent of the recorder full scale. If the peak maximum of a 1.0-ml aliquot is off scale on the recorder, further dilute the original source sample to bring the Hg concentration into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer.</P>
              <P>11.3.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.</P>
              <P>11.3.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Use the Method of Standard Additions as follows to check at least one sample from each source for matrix effects on the Hg results. The Method of Standard Additions procedures described on pages 9-4 and 9-5 of the section entitled “General Information” of the Perkin Elmer Corporation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry Manual, Number 303-0152 (Reference 16 in Section 16.0) are recommended. If the results of the Method of Standard Additions procedure used on the single source sample do not agree to within ±5 percent of the value obtained by the routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from the source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.</P>

              <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of Hg emissions from sewage sludge incinerators and other sources as specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations.</P>
              <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

              <P>2.1 Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and are collected in acidic potassium permanganate (KMnO<E T="52">4</E>) solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an optical cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.</P>

              </HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>

              <P>4.1 Sample Collection. Excessive oxidizable organic matter in the stack gas prematurely depletes the KMnO<E T="52">4</E> solution and thereby prevents further collection of Hg.</P>
              <P>4.2 Analysis. Condensation of water vapor on the optical cell windows causes a positive interference.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 Safety</HD>
              <P>5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.</P>
              <P>5.2 Corrosive Reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal burns.</P>
              <P>5.2.1 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Highly toxic. Vapors are highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, producing hydrogen gas.</P>
              <P>5.2.2 Nitric Acid (HNO<E T="52">3</E>). Highly corrosive to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs. Vapors cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Reaction to inhalation may be delayed as long as 30 hours and still be fatal. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Strong oxidizer. Hazardous reaction may occur with organic materials such as solvents.</P>
              <P>5.2.3 Sulfuric acid (H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>). Rapidly destructive to body tissue. Will cause third degree burns. Eye damage may result in blindness. Inhalation may be fatal from spasm of the larynx, usually within 30 minutes. May cause lung tissue damage with edema. 3 mg/m<SU>3</SU> will cause lung damage in uninitiated. 1 mg/m<SU>3</SU> for 8 hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals and organics.</P>

              <P>5.3 Chlorine Evolution. Hydrochloric acid reacts with KMnO<E T="52">4</E> to liberate chlorine gas. Although this is a minimal concern when small quantities of HCl (5-10 ml) are used in the impinger rinse, a potential safety hazard may still exist. At sources that emit higher concentrations of oxidizable materials (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> power plants), more HCl may be required to remove the larger amounts of brown deposit formed in the impingers. In such cases, the potential safety hazards due to sample container pressurization are greater, because of the larger volume of HCl rinse added to the recovered sample. These hazards are eliminated by storing and analyzing the HCl impinger wash separately from the permanganate impinger sample.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage</HD>
              <P>Same as Method 101, Section 8.0, with the exception of the following:</P>

              <P>8.1 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 101, Section 8.2, except that the liberation of free iodine in the first impinger <PRTPAGE P="256"/>due to high Hg or sulfur dioxide concentrations is not applicable. In this method, high oxidizable organic content may make it impossible to sample for the desired minimum time. This problem is indicated by the complete bleaching of the purple color of the KMnO<E T="52">4</E> solution. In cases where an excess of water condensation is encountered, collect two runs to make one sample, or add an extra impinger in front of the first impinger (also containing acidified KMnO<E T="52">4</E> solution).</P>
              <P>8.2 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as Method 101, Section 8.3, with the exception of the following:</P>

              <P>8.2.1 In this method, clean all the glass components by rinsing with 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, tap water, 8 N HCl, tap water, and finally with deionized distilled water. Then place 50 ml of absorbing solution in the first impinger and 100 ml in each of the second and third impingers.</P>
              <P>8.2.2 If a filter is used, use a pair of tweezers to place the filter in the filter holder. Be sure to center the filter, and place the gasket in the proper position to prevent the sample gas stream from bypassing the filter. Check the filter for tears after assembly is completed. Be sure also to set the filter heating system at the desired operating temperature after the sampling train has been assembled.</P>
              <P>8.3 Sampling Train Operation. In addition to the procedure outlined in Method 101, Section 8.5, maintain a temperature around the filter (if applicable) of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F).</P>
              <P>8.4 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 101, Section 8.7, with the exception of the following:</P>
              <P>8.4.1 Transfer the probe, impinger assembly, and (if applicable) filter assembly to the cleanup area.</P>
              <P>8.4.2 Treat the sample as follows:</P>
              <P>8.4.2.1 Container No. 1 (Impinger, Probe, and Filter Holder) and, if applicable, Container No. 1A (HCl rinse).</P>

              <P>8.4.2.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure the liquid in the first three impingers to within 1 ml. Record the volume of liquid present (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> see Figure 5-6 of Method 5). This information is needed to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. (Use only graduated cylinder and glass storage bottles that have been precleaned as in Section 8.2.1.) Place the contents of the first three impingers (four if an extra impinger was added as described in Section 8.1) into a 1000-ml glass sample bottle labeled Container No. 1.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>If a filter is used, remove the filter from its holder as outlined under Section 8.4.3.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>8.4.2.1.2 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover the Hg (and any condensate) from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, front half of the filter holder (if applicable), and impingers as follows: Rinse these components with a total of 400 ml (350 ml if an extra impinger was added as described in Section 8.1) of fresh absorbing solution, carefully assuring removal of all loose particulate matter from the impingers; add all washings to the 1000 ml glass sample bottle. To remove any residual brown deposits on the glassware following the permanganate rinse, rinse with approximately 100 ml of water, carefully assuring removal of all loose particulate matter from the impingers. Add this rinse to Container No. 1.</P>
              <P>8.4.2.1.3 If no visible deposits remain after this water rinse, do not rinse with 8 N HCl. If deposits do remain on the glassware after the water rinse, wash impinger walls and stems with 25 ml of 8 N HCl, and place the wash in a separate container labeled Container No. 1A as follows: Place 200 ml of water in a sample container labeled Container No. 1A. Wash the impinger walls and stem with the HCl by turning the impinger on its side and rotating it so that the HCl contacts all inside surfaces. Pour the HCl wash carefully with stirring into Container No. 1A.</P>
              <P>8.4.2.1.4 After all washings have been collected in the appropriate sample container(s), tighten the lid(s) on the container(s) to prevent leakage during shipment to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to allow subsequent determination of whether leakage has occurred during transport. Label each container to identify its contents clearly.</P>
              <P>8.4.3 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.</P>
              <P>8.4.4 Container No. 3 (Filter). If a filter was used, carefully remove it from the filter holder, place it in a 100-ml glass sample bottle, and add 20 to 40 ml of absorbing solution. If it is necessary to fold the filter, be sure that the particulate cake is inside the fold. Carefully transfer to the 100-ml sample bottle any particulate matter and filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket by using a dry Nylon bristle brush and a sharp-edged blade. Seal the container. Label the container to identify its contents clearly. Mark the height of the fluid level to allow subsequent determination of whether leakage has occurred during transport.</P>
              <P>8.4.5 Container No. 4 (Filter Blank). If a filter was used, treat an unused filter from the same filter lot as that used for sampling according to the procedures outlined in Section 8.4.4.</P>

              <P>8.4.6 Container No. 5 (Absorbing Solution Blank). Place 650 ml of 4 percent KMnO<E T="52">4</E> absorbing solution in a 1000-ml sample bottle. Seal the container.</P>

              <P>8.4.7 Container No. 6 (HCl Rinse Blank). Place 200 ml of water in a 1000-ml sample bottle, and add 25 ml of 8 N HCl carefully <PRTPAGE P="257"/>with stirring. Seal the container. Only one blank sample per 3 runs is required.</P>

If conditions (1) and (2) are met, attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell. Add sodium chloride-hydroxylamine in 1 ml increments until the solution is colorless. Now add 5 ml of tin (II) solution to the aeration bottle through the side arm, and immediately stopper the side arm. Stir the solution for 15 seconds, turn on the recorder, open the aeration cell exit arm stopcock, and immediately initiate aeration with continued stirring.

              <P>11.2.2.1 Filter the contents of Container No. 1 through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into a 1 liter volumetric flask to remove the brown manganese dioxide (MnO<E T="52">2</E>) precipitate. Save the filter for digestion of the brown MnO<E T="52">2</E> precipitate. Add the sample filtrate from Container No. 3 to the 1-liter volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water. If the combined filtrates are greater than 1000 ml, determine the volume to the <PRTPAGE P="258"/>nearest ml and make the appropriate corrections for blank subtractions. Mix thoroughly. Mark the filtrate as analysis Sample No. A.1 and analyze for Hg within 48 hr of the filtration step. Place the saved filter, which was used to remove the brown MnO<E T="52">2</E> precipitate, into an appropriate sized container. In a laboratory hood, add 25 ml of 8 N HCl to the filter and allow to digest for a minimum of 24 hours at room temperature.</P>

              <P>11.2.2.2 Filter the contents of Container 1A through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into a 500-ml volumetric flask. Then filter the digestate of the brown MnO<E T="52">2</E> precipitate from Container No. 1 through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into the same 500-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water.

If the 10 ml sample is below the detectable limit, use a larger aliquot (up to 20 ml), but decrease the volume of water added to the aeration cell accordingly to prevent the solution volume from exceeding the capacity of the aeration bottle. If the peak maximum of a 1.0 ml aliquot is off scale, further dilute the original sample to bring the Hg concentration into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer. If the Hg content of the absorbing solution and filter blank is below the working range of the analytical method, use zero for the blank.</P>

Calibration of the orifice meter at flow conditions that simulate the conditions at the source is suggested. Calibration should either be done with hydrogen or with some other gas having a similar Reynolds Number so that there is similarity between the Reynolds Numbers during calibration and during sampling.

              <P>Guidelines for source testing are detailed in the following sections. These guidelines are generally applicable; however, most sample sites differ to some degree and temporary alterations such as stack extensions or expansions often are required to insure the best possible sample site. Further, since Be is hazardous, care should be taken to minimize exposure. Finally, since the total quantity of Be to be collected is quite small, the test must be carefully conducted to prevent contamination or loss of sample.</P>
              <P>8.1 Selection of a Sampling Site and Number of Sample Runs. Select a suitable sample site that is as close as practicable to the point of atmospheric emission. If possible, stacks smaller than one foot in diameter should not be sampled.</P>

              <P>8.1.1 Ideal Sampling Site. The ideal sampling site is at least eight stack or duct diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion or contraction. For rectangular cross sections, use Equation 103-1 in Section 12.2 to determine an equivalent diameter, D<E T="52">e</E>.</P>
              <P>8.1.2 Alternate Sampling Site. Some sampling situations may render the above sampling site criteria impractical. In such cases, select an alternate site no less than two diameters downstream and one-half diameter upstream from any point of flow disturbance. Additional sample runs are recommended at any sample site not meeting the criteria of Section 8.1.1.</P>
              <P>8.1.3 Number of Sample Runs Per Test. Three sample runs constitute a test. Conduct each run at one of three different points. Select three points that proportionately divide the diameter, or are located at 25, 50, and 75 percent of the diameter from the inside wall. For horizontal ducts, sample on a vertical line through the centroid. For rectangular ducts, sample on a line through the centroid and parallel to a side. If additional sample runs are performed per Section 8.1.2, proportionately divide the duct to accommodate the total number of runs.</P>
              <P>8.2 Measurement of Stack Conditions. Using the equipment described in Section 6.2, measure the stack gas pressure, moisture, and temperature to determine the molecular weight of the stack gas. Sound engineering estimates may be made in lieu of direct measurements. Describe the basis for such estimates in the test report.</P>
              <P>8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.</P>
              <P>8.3.1 Assemble the sampling train as shown in Figure 103-1. It is recommended that all glassware be precleaned by soaking in wash acid for two hours.</P>
              <P>8.3.2 Leak check the sampling train at the sampling site. The leakage rate should not be in excess of 1 percent of the desired sample rate.</P>
              <P>8.4 Sampling Train Operation.</P>
              <P>8.4.1 For each run, measure the velocity at the selected sampling point. Determine the isokinetic sampling rate. Record the velocity head and the required sampling rate. Place the nozzle at the sampling point with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. At the conclusion of the test, record the sampling rate. Again measure the velocity head at the sampling point. The required isokinetic rate at the end of the period should not have deviated more than 20 percent from that originally calculated. Describe the reason for any deviation beyond 20 percent in the test report.</P>
              <P>8.4.2 Sample at a minimum rate of 14 liters/min (0.5 cfm). Obtain samples over such a period or periods of time as are necessary to determine the maximum emissions which would occur in a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, perform sufficient sample runs so as to allow determination or calculation of the emissions that occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sampling time of two hours per run is recommended.</P>
              <P>8.5 Sample Recovery.</P>
              <P>8.5.1 It is recommended that all glassware be precleaned as in Section 8.3. Sample recovery should also be performed in an area free of possible Be contamination. When the sampling train is moved, exercise care to prevent breakage and contamination. Set aside a portion of the acetone used in the sample recovery as a blank for analysis. The total amount of acetone used should be measured for accurate blank correction. Blanks can be eliminated if prior analysis shows negligible amounts.</P>
              <P>8.5.2 Remove the filter (and backup filter, if used) and any loose particulate matter from filter holder, and place in a container.</P>
              <P>8.5.3 Clean the probe with acetone and a brush or long rod and cotton balls. Wash into the container with the filter. Wash out the filter holder with acetone, and add to the same container.</P>

              <P>4.1 Matrix Effects. Analysis for Be by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry is sensitive to the chemical composition and to the physical properties (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, viscosity, pH) of the sample. Aluminum and silicon, in particular, are known to interfere when present in appreciable quantities. The analytical procedure includes (optionally) the use of the Method of Standard Additions to check for these matrix effects, and sample analysis using the Method of Standard Additions if significant matrix effects are found to be present (see Reference 2 in Section 17.0).</P>

              <P>8.3.4 Probe and filter heating systems are needed only if water condensation is a problem. If this is the case, adjust the heaters to provide a temperature at or above the stack temperature. However, membrane filters such as the Millipore AA are limited to about 107 °C (225 °F). If the stack gas is in excess of about 93 °C (200 °F), consideration should be given to an alternate procedure such as moving the filter holder downstream of the first impinger to insure that the filter does not exceed its temperature limit. After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the probe heating system, if applicable, at the desired operating temperature. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed ice around the impingers.

Therefore, the chromatograph operator <PRTPAGE P="274"/>should select the column and operating parameters best suited to the particular analysis requirements. The selection made is subject to approval of the Administrator. Approval is automatic, provided that confirming data are produced through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, and that the data are available for review by the Administrator.

              <P>7.1.2 Hydrogen. Purity 99.9995 percent or greater.</P>
              <P>7.1.3 Oxygen or Air. Either oxygen (purity 99.99 percent or greater) or air (less than 0.1 ppmv total hydrocarbon content), as required by detector.</P>
              <P>7.2 Calibration. Use one of the following options: either Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, or Section 7.2.3.</P>
              <P>7.2.1 Vinyl Chloride. Pure vinyl chloride gas certified by the manufacturer to contain a minimum of 99.9 percent vinyl chloride. If the gas manufacturer maintains a bulk cylinder supply of 99.9 + percent vinyl chloride, the certification analysis may have been performed on this supply, rather than on each gas cylinder prepared from this bulk supply. The date of gas cylinder preparation and the certified analysis must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the gas manufacturer to the buyer.</P>
              <P>7.2.2 Nitrogen. Same as described in Section 7.1.1.</P>
              <P>7.2.3 Cylinder Standards. Gas mixture standards (50-,10-, and 5 ppmv vinyl chloride) in nitrogen cylinders may be used to directly prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Section 10.3 if the following conditions are met: (a) The manufacturer certifies the gas composition with an accuracy of ±3 percent or better. (b) The manufacturer recommends a maximum shelf life over which the gas concentration does not change by greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. (c) The manufacturer affixes the date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf to the cylinder before shipment to the buyer.</P>
              <P>7.2.3.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall certify the concentration of vinyl chloride in nitrogen in each cylinder by (a) directly analyzing each cylinder and (b) calibrating his analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate his analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use as a minimum, a three point calibration curve. It is recommended that the manufacturer maintain (1) a high concentration calibration standard (between 50 and 100 ppmv) to prepare his calibration curve by an appropriate dilution technique and (2) a low-concentration calibration standard (between 5 and 10 ppmv) to verify the dilution technique used. If the difference between the apparent concentration read from the calibration curve and the true concentration assigned to the low-concentration calibration standard exceeds 5 percent of the true concentration, the manufacturer shall determine the source of error and correct it, then repeat the three-point calibration.</P>
              <P>7.2.3.2 Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before using a standard, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration standard (a) by comparing it to gas mixtures prepared (with 99 mole percent vinyl chloride) in accordance with the procedure described in Section 7.2.1 or (b) calibrating it against vinyl chloride cylinder Standard Reference Materials (SRM's) prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, if such SRM's are available. The agreement between the initially determined concentration value and the verification concentration value must be ±5 percent. The manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a time interval consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards sold.</P>

              <P>8.1 Bag Leak-Check. The following leak-check procedure is recommended, but not required, prior to sample collection. The post-test leak-check procedure is mandatory. Connect a water manometer and pressurize the bag to 5 to 10 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (2 to 4 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O). Allow to stand for 10 min. Any displacement in the water manometer indicates a leak. Also, check the rigid container for leaks in this manner.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

                <P>An alternative leak-check method is to pressurize the bag to 5 to 10 cm H2O and allow it to stand overnight. A deflated bag indicates a leak. For each sample bag in its rigid container, place a rotameter in line between the bag and the pump inlet. Evacuate the bag. Failure of the rotameter to register <PRTPAGE P="276"/>zero flow when the bag appears to be empty indicates a leak.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>8.2 Sample Collection. Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 106-1. Join the quick connects as illustrated, and determine that all connection between the bag and the probe are tight. Place the end of the probe at the centroid of the stack and start the pump with the needle valve adjusted to yield a flow that will fill over 50 percent of bag volume in the specific sample period. After allowing sufficient time to purge the line several times, change the vacuum line from the container to the bag and evacuate the bag until the rotameter indicates no flow. Then reposition the sample and vacuum lines and begin the actual sampling, keeping the rate proportional to the stack velocity. At all times, direct the gas exiting the rotameter away from sampling personnel. At the end of the sample period, shut off the pump, disconnect the sample line from the bag, and disconnect the vacuum line from the bag container. Protect the bag container from sunlight.</P>
              <P>8.3 Sample Storage. Keep the sample bags out of direct sunlight. When at all possible, analysis is to be performed within 24 hours, but in no case in excess of 72 hours of sample collection. Aluminized Mylar bag samples must be analyzed within 24 hours.</P>
              <P>8.4 Post-test Bag Leak-Check. Subsequent to recovery and analysis of the sample, leak-check the sample bag according to the procedure outlined in Section 8.1.</P>

              <P>10.1 Preparation of Vinyl Chloride Standard Gas Mixtures. (Optional Procedure-delete if cylinder standards are used.) Evacuate a 16-inch square Tedlar bag that has passed a leak-check (described in Section 8.1) and meter in 5.0 liters of nitrogen. While the bag is filling, use the 0.5-ml syringe to inject 250 µl of 99.9 + percent vinyl chloride gas through the wall of the bag. Upon withdrawing the syringe, immediately cover the resulting hole with a piece of adhesive tape. The bag now contains a vinyl chloride concentration of 50 ppmv. In a like manner use the 50 µl syringe to prepare gas mixtures having 10-and 5-ppmv vinyl chloride concentrations. Place each bag on a smooth surface and alternately depress opposite sides of the bag 50 times to further mix the gases. These gas mixture standards may be used for 10 days from the date of preparation, after which time new gas mixtures must be prepared. (Caution: Contamination may be a problem when a bag is reused if the new gas mixture standard is a lower concentration than the previous gas mixture standard.)</P>
              <P>10.2 Determination of Vinyl Chloride Retention Time. (This section can be performed simultaneously with Section 10.3.) Establish chromatograph conditions identical with those in Section 11.3. Determine proper attenuator position. Flush the sampling loop with helium or nitrogen and activate the sample valve. Record the injection time, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, chart speed, and attenuator setting. Record peaks and detector responses that occur in the absence of vinyl chloride. Maintain conditions with the equipment plumbing arranged identically to Section 11.2, and flush the sample loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min with one of the vinyl chloride calibration mixtures. Then activate the sample valve. Record the injection time. Select the peak that corresponds to vinyl chloride. Measure the distance on the chart from the injection time to the time at which the peak maximum occurs. This quantity divided by the chart speed is defined as the retention time. Since other organics may be present in the sample, positive identification of the vinyl chloride peak must be made.</P>

              <P>10.3 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve. Make a GC measurement of each gas mixture standard (described in Section 7.2.3 or 10.1) using conditions identical to those listed in Sections 11.2 and 11.3. Flush the sampling loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min with one of the standard mixtures, and activate the sample valve. Record the concentration of vinyl chloride injected (C<E T="52">c</E>), attenuator setting, chart speed, peak area, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and retention time. Record the barometric pressure. Calculate A<E T="52">c</E>, the peak area multiplied by the attenuator setting. Repeat until two consecutive injection areas are within 5 percent, then plot the average of those two values versus C<E T="52">c</E>. When the other standard gas mixtures have been similarly analyzed and plotted, draw a straight line through the points derived by the least squares method. Perform calibration daily, or before and after the analysis of each emission test set of bag samples, whichever is more frequent. For each group of sample analyses, use the average of the two calibration curves which <PRTPAGE P="277"/>bracket that group to determine the respective sample concentrations. If the two calibration curves differ by more than 5 percent from their mean value, then report the final results by both calibration curves.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>

              <P>11.2 Sample Recovery. With a new piece of Teflon tubing identified for that bag, connect a bag inlet valve to the gas chromatograph sample valve. Switch the valve to receive gas from the bag through the sample loop. Arrange the equipment so the sample gas passes from the sample valve to 100-ml/min rotameter with flow control valve followed by a charcoal tube and a 1-in. H<E T="52">2</E>O pressure gauge. Maintain the sample flow either by a vacuum pump or container pressurization if the collection bag remains in the rigid container. After sample loop purging is ceased, allow the pressure gauge to return to zero before activating the gas sampling valve.</P>
              <P>11.3 Analysis.</P>

              <P>11.3.1 Set the column temperature to 100 °C (210 °F) and the detector temperature to 150 °C (300 °F). When optimum hydrogen and oxygen (or air) flow rates have been determined, verify and maintain these flow rates during all chromatography operations. Using helium or nitrogen as the carrier gas, establish a flow rate in the range consistent with the manufacturer's requirements for satisfactory detector operation. A flow rate of approximately 40 ml/min should produce adequate separations. Observe the base line periodically and determine that the noise level has stabilized and that base line drift has ceased. Purge the sample loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min, shut off flow, allow the sample loop pressure to reach atmospheric pressure as indicated by the H<E T="52">2</E>O manometer, then activate the sample valve. Record the injection time (the position of the pen on the chart at the time of sample injection), sample number, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, chart speed, and attenuator setting. Record the barometric pressure. From the chart, note the peak having the retention time corresponding to vinyl chloride as determined in Section 10.2. Measure the vinyl chloride peak area, A<E T="52">m</E>, by use of a disc integrator, electronic integrator, or a planimeter. Measure and record the peak heights, H<E T="52">m</E>. Record A<E T="52">m</E> and retention time. Repeat the injection at least two times or until two consecutive values for the total area of the vinyl chloride peak agree within 5 percent of their average. Use the average value for these two total areas to compute the bag concentration.</P>
              <P>11.3.2 Compare the ratio of H<E T="52">m</E> to A<E T="52">m</E> for the vinyl chloride sample with the same ratio for the standard peak that is closest in height. If these ratios differ by more than 10 percent, the vinyl chloride peak may not be pure (possibly acetaldehyde is present) and the secondary column should be employed (see Section 6.3.2.2).</P>

              <P>11.4 Determination of Bag Water Vapor Content. Measure the ambient temperature and barometric pressure near the bag. From a water saturation vapor pressure table, determine and record the water vapor content of the bag, B<E T="52">wb</E>, as a decimal figure. (Assume the relative humidity to be 100 percent unless a lesser value is known.)</P>

              <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of the vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) content of in-process wastewater samples, and the residual vinyl chloride monomer (RCVM) content of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, wet, cake, slurry, and latex samples. It cannot be used for polymer in fused forms, such as sheet or cubes. This method is not acceptable where methods from section 304(h) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972 as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977) are required.</P>
              <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
              <P>2.1 The basis for this method relates to the vapor equilibrium that is established at a constant known temperature in a closed system between RVCM, PVC resin, water, and air. The RVCM in a PVC resin will equilibrate rapidly in a closed vessel, provided that the temperature of the PVC resin is maintained above the glass transition temperature of that specific resin.</P>
              <P>2.2 A sample of PVC or in-process wastewater is collected in a vial or bottle and is conditioned. The headspace in the vial or bottle is then analyzed for vinyl chloride using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector.</P>

              <P>4.1 The chromatograph columns and the corresponding operating parameters herein described normally provide an adequate resolution of vinyl chloride; however, resolution interferences may be encountered on some sources. Therefore, the chromatograph operator shall select the column and operating parameters best suited to his particular analysis requirements, subject to the approval of the Administrator. Approval is automatic provided that confirming data are produced through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, such as analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy, and that these data are made available for review by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.</P>
              <P>5.2 Toxic Analyte. Care must be exercised to prevent exposure of sampling personnel to vinyl chloride, which is a carcinogen. Do not release vinyl chloride to the laboratory atmosphere during preparation of standards. Venting or purging with VCM/air mixtures must be held to a minimum. When they are required, the vapor must be routed to outside air. Vinyl chloride, even at low ppm levels, must never be vented inside the laboratory. After vials have been analyzed, the gas must be vented prior to removal of the vial from the instrument turntable. Vials must be vented through a hypodermic needle connected to an activated charcoal tube to prevent release of vinyl chloride into the laboratory atmosphere. The charcoal must be replaced prior to vinyl chloride breakthrough.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>
              <P>7.1 Analysis. Same as Method 106, Section 7.1, with the addition of the following:</P>
              <P>7.1.1 Water. Interference-free.</P>
              <P>7.2 Calibration. The following items are required for calibration:</P>
              <P>7.2.1 Cylinder Standards (4). Gas mixture standards (50-, 500-, 2000- and 4000-ppm vinyl chloride in nitrogen cylinders). Cylinder standards may be used directly to prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Section 10.3, if the following conditions are met: (a) The manufacturer certifies the gas composition with an accuracy of ±3 percent or better (see Section 7.2.1.1). (b) The manufacturer recommends a maximum shelf life over which the gas concentration does not change by greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. (c) The manufacturer affixes the date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf life to the cylinder before shipment to the buyer.</P>
              <P>7.2.1.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall certify the concentration of vinyl chloride in nitrogen in each cylinder by (a) directly analyzing each cylinder and (b) calibrating the analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate the analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use, as a minimum, a 3-point calibration curve. It is recommended that the manufacturer maintain (1) a high-concentration calibration standard (between 4000 and 8000 ppm) to prepare the calibration curve by an appropriate dilution technique and (2) a low-concentration calibration standard (between 50 and 500 ppm) to verify the dilution technique used. If the difference between the apparent concentration read from the calibration curve and the true concentration assigned to the low-concentration calibration standard exceeds 5 percent of the true concentration, the manufacturer shall determine the source of error and correct it, then repeat the 3-point calibration.</P>
              <P>7.2.1.2 Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before using, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration standard by (a) comparing it to gas mixtures prepared (with 99 mole percent vinyl chloride) in accordance with the procedure described in Section 10.1 of Method 106 or by (b) calibrating it against vinyl chloride cylinder Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, if such SRMs are available. The agreement between the initially determined concentration value and the verification concentration value must be within 5 percent. The manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a time interval consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards sold.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</HD>
              <P>8.1 Sample Collection.</P>
              <P>8.1.1 PVC Sampling. Allow the resin or slurry to flow from a tap on the tank or silo until the tap line has been well purged. Extend and fill a 60-ml sample bottle under the tap, and immediately tighten a cap on the bottle. Wrap adhesive tape around the cap and bottle to prevent the cap from loosening. Place an identifying label on each bottle, and record the date, time, and sample location both on the bottles and in a log book.</P>
              <P>8.1.2 Water Sampling. At the sampling location fill the vials bubble-free to overflowing so that a convex meniscus forms at the top. The excess water is displaced as the sealing disc is carefully placed, with the Teflon side down, on the opening of the vial. Place the aluminum seal over the disc and the neck of the vial, and crimp into place. Affix an identifying label on the bottle, and record the date, time, and sample location both on the vials and in a log book.</P>
              <P>8.2 Sample Storage. All samples must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection, and must be refrigerated during this period.</P>

              </NOTE>
              <P>10.1 Preparation of Standards. Calibration standards are prepared as follows: Place 100 µl or about two equal drops of distilled water in the sample vial, then fill the vial with the VCM/nitrogen standard, rapidly seat the septum, and seal with the aluminum cap. Use a <FR>1/8</FR>-in. stainless steel line from the cylinder to the vial. Do not use rubber or Tygon tubing. The sample line from the cylinder must be purged (into a properly vented hood) for several minutes prior to filling the vials. After purging, reduce the flow rate to between 500 and 1000 cc/min. Place end of tubing into vial (near bottom). Position a septum on top of the vial, pressing it against the <FR>1/8</FR>-in. filling tube to minimize the size of the vent opening. This is necessary to minimize mixing air with the standard in the vial. Each vial is to be purged with standard for 90 seconds, during which time the filling tube is gradually slid to the top of the vial. After the 90 seconds, the tube is removed with the septum, simultaneously sealing the vial. Practice will be necessary to develop good technique. Rubber gloves should be worn during the above operations. The sealed vial must then be pressurized for 60 seconds using the vial prepressurizer. Test the vial for leakage by placing a drop of water on the septum at the needle hole. Prepressurization of standards is not required unless samples have been prepressurized.</P>
              <P>10.2 Analyzer Calibration. Calibration is to be performed each 8-hour period the chromatograph is used. Alternatively, calibration with duplicate 50-, 500-, 2,000-, and 4,000-ppm standards (hereafter described as a four-point calibration) may be performed on a monthly basis, provided that a calibration confirmation test consisting of duplicate analyses of an appropriate standard is performed once per plant shift, or once per chromatograph carrousel operation (if the chromatograph operation is less frequent than once per shift). The criterion for acceptance of each calibration confirmation test is that both analyses of 500-ppm standards [2,000-ppm standards if dispersion resin (excluding latex resin) samples are being analyzed] must be within 5 percent of the most recent four-point calibration curve. If this criterion is not met, then a complete four-point calibration must be performed before sample analyses can proceed.</P>

              <P>10.3 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve. Prepare two vials each of 50-, 500-, 2,000-, and 4,000-ppm standards. Run the calibration samples in exactly the same manner as regular samples. Plot A<E T="52">s</E>, the integrator area counts for each standard sample, versus C<E T="52">c</E>, the concentration of vinyl chloride in each standard sample. Draw a straight line through the points derived by the least squares method.</P>

              <P>11.2.2.2 Because of gauge errors, the apparatus may over-pressurize the vial. If the vial pressure is at or higher than the dosing pressure, an audible double injection will occur. If the vial pressure is too low, errors will occur on resin samples because of inadequate time for head-space gas equilibrium. This condition can be avoided by running several standard gas samples at various pressures around the calculated pressure, and then selecting the highest pressure that does not produce a double injection. All samples and standards must be pressurized for 60 seconds using the vial prepressurizer. The vial is then placed into the 90 °C conditioning bath and tested for leakage by placing a drop of water on the septum at the needle hole. A clean, burr-free needle is mandatory.</P>

              <P>11.6.2. A—Analysis Time. The normal setting is approximately 70 percent of the VCM retention time. When this timer terminates, the programmer initiates backflushing of the first column.</P>
              <P>11.6.3. B—Backflushing Time. The normal setting is double the analysis time.</P>
              <P>11.6.4. W—Stabilization Time. The normal setting is 0.5 min to 1.0 min.</P>
              <P>11.6.5. X—Number of Analyses Per Sample. The normal setting is one.</P>
              <P>11.7. Sample Treatment. All samples must be recovered and analyzed within 24 hours after collection.</P>

              <P>11.7.1 Resin Samples. The weight of the resin used must be between 0.1 and 4.5 grams. An exact weight must be obtained (within ±1 percent) for each sample. In the case of suspension resins, a volumetric cup can be prepared for holding the required amount of sample. When the cup is used, open the sample bottle, and add the cup volume of resin to the tared sample vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap). Obtain the exact sample weight, add 100 ml or about two equal drops of water, and immediately seal the vial. Report this value on the data sheet; it is required for calculation of RVCM. In the case of dispersion resins, the cup cannot be used. Weigh the sample in an aluminum dish, transfer the sample to the tared vial, and accurately weigh it in the vial. After prepressurization of the samples, condition them for a minimum of 1 hour in the 90 °C (190 °F) bath. Do not exceed 5 hours. Prepressurization is not required if the sample weight, as analyzed, does not exceed 0.2 gram. It is also not required if solution of the prepressurization equation yields an absolute prepressurization value that is within 30 percent of the atmospheric pressure.

                <P>Some aluminum vial caps have a center section that must be removed prior to placing into sample tray. If the cap is not removed, the injection needle will be damaged.</P>

              <P>11.7.2 Suspension Resin Slurry and Wet Cake Samples. Decant the water from a wet cake sample, and turn the sample bottle upside down onto a paper towel. Wait for the water to drain, place approximately 0.2 to 4.0 grams of the wet cake sample in a tared vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap) and seal immediately. Then determine the sample weight (1 percent). All samples weighing over 0.2 gram, must be prepressurized prior to conditioning for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F), except as noted in Section 11.7.1. A sample of wet cake is used to determine total solids (TS). This is required for calculating the RVCM.</P>
              <P>11.7.3 Dispersion Resin Slurry and Latex Samples.The materials should not be filtered. Sample must be thoroughly mixed. Using a tared vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap) add approximately eight drops (0.25 to 0.35 g) of slurry or latex using a medicine dropper. This should be done immediately after mixing. Seal the vial as soon as possible. Determine sample weight (1 percent). Condition the vial for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F) in the analyzer bath. Determine the TS on the slurry sample (Section 11.10).</P>

              <P>11.7.4 In-process Wastewater Samples. Using a tared vial (tared, including septum <PRTPAGE P="284"/>and aluminum cap) quickly add approximately 1 cc of water using a medicine dropper. Seal the vial as soon as possible. Determine sample weight (1 percent). Condition the vial for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F) in the analyzer bath.</P>
              <P>11.8 Preparation of Sample Turntable.</P>
              <P>11.8.1 Before placing any sample into turntable, be certain that the center section of the aluminum cap has been removed. The numbered sample vials should be placed in the corresponding numbered positions in the turntable. Insert samples in the following order:</P>
              <P>11.8.1.1 Positions 1 and 2. Old 2000-ppm standards for conditioning. These are necessary only after the analyzer has not been used for 24 hours or longer.</P>
              <P>11.8.1.2 Position 3. 50-ppm standard, freshly prepared.</P>
              <P>11.8.1.3 Position 4. 500-ppm standard, freshly prepared.</P>
              <P>11.8.1.4 Position 5. 2000-ppm standard, freshly prepared.</P>
              <P>11.8.1.5 Position 6. 4000-ppm standard, freshly prepared.</P>
              <P>11.8.1.6 Position 7. Sample No. 7 (This is the first sample of the day, but is given as 7 to be consistent with the turntable and the integrator printout.)</P>
              <P>11.8.2 After all samples have been positioned, insert the second set of 50-, 500-, 2000-, and 4000-ppm standards. Samples, including standards, must be conditioned in the bath of 90 °C (190 °F) for a minimum of one hour and a maximum of five hours.</P>
              <P>11.9 Start Chromatograph Program. When all samples, including standards, have been conditioned at 90 °C (190 °F) for at least one hour, start the analysis program according to the manufacturer's instructions. These instructions must be carefully followed when starting and stopping a program to prevent damage to the dosing assembly.</P>
              <P>11.10 Determination of Total Solids. For wet cake, slurry, resin solution, and PVC latex samples, determine TS for each sample by accurately weighing approximately 3 to 4 grams of sample in an aluminum pan before and after placing in a draft oven (105 to 110 °C (221 to 230 °F)). Samples must be dried to constant weight. After first weighing, return the pan to the oven for a short period of time, and then reweigh to verify complete dryness. The TS are then calculated as the final sample weight divided by initial sample weight.</P>

              </FP>
              

              <P>Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons unfamiliar with the operation of a gas chromatograph (GC) or by those who are unfamiliar with source sampling because knowledge beyond the scope of this presentation is required. Care must be exercised to prevent exposure of sampling personnel to vinyl chloride, a carcinogen.

              </FP>
              

              <P>1.1 Applicability. This is an alternative method and applies to the measurement of the vinyl chloride content of solvents, resin solvent solutions, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin, wet cake slurries, latex, and fabricated resin samples. This method is not acceptable where methods from Section 304(h) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251<E T="03">et seq.,</E> (the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977) are required.</P>

              <P>1.2 Principle. The basis for this method lies in the direct injection of a liquid sample into a chromatograph and the subsequent evaporation of all volatile material into the carrier gas stream of the chromatograph, thus permitting analysis of all volatile material including vinyl chloride.

              <FP>2. <E T="03">Range and Sensitivity</E>
              </FP>
              
              <P>The lower limit of detection of vinyl chloride in dry PVC resin is 0.2 ppm. For resin solutions, latexes, and wet resin, this limit rises inversely as the nonvolatile (resin) content decreases.</P>

              <P>With proper calibration, the upper limit may be extended as needed.

              <FP>3. <E T="03">Interferences</E>
              </FP>
              

              <P>The chromatograph columns and the corresponding operating parameters herein described normally provide an adequate resolution of vinyl chloride. In cases where resolution interferences are encountered, the chromatograph operator shall select the column and operating parameters best suited to his <PRTPAGE P="286"/>particular analysis problem, subject to the approval of the Administrator. Approval is automatic, provided that the tester produces confirming data through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, such as analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy, and has the data available for review by the Administrator.

              <FP>4. <E T="03">Precision and Reproducibility</E>
              </FP>
              
              <P>A standard sample of latex containing 181.8 ppm vinyl chloride analyzed 10 times by the alternative method showed a standard deviation of 7.5 percent and a mean error of 0.21 percent.</P>

              <P>A sample of vinyl chloride copolymer resin solution was analyzed 10 times by the alternative method and showed a standard deviation of 6.6 percent at a level of 35 ppm.

              <P>Do not release vinyl chloride to the laboratory atmosphere during preparation of standards. Venting or purging with vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) air mixtures must be held to minimum. When purging is required, the vapor must be routed to outside air. Vinyl chloride, even at low-ppm levels, must never be vented inside the laboratory.

              <P>8.1 Sampling. Allow the liquid or dried resin to flow from a tap on the tank, silo, or pipeline until the tap has been purged. Fill a wide-mouth pint bottle, and immediately tightly cap the bottle. Place an identifying label on each bottle and record the date, time, sample location, and material.</P>
              <P>8.2 Sample Treatment. Sample must be run within 24 hours.</P>
              <P>8.2.1 Resin Samples. Weigh 9.00 ±0.01 g of THF or DMAC in a tared 20-ml vial. Add 1.00 ±0.01 g of resin to the tared vial containing the THF or DMAC. Close the vial tightly with the screw cap, and shake or otherwise agitate the vial until complete solution of the resin is obtained. Shaking may require several minutes to several hours, depending on the nature of the resin.</P>
              <P>8.2.2 Suspension Resin Slurry and Wet Resin Sample. Slurry must be filtered using a small Buchner funnel with vacuum to yield a wet resin sample. The filtering process must be continued only as long as a steady stream of water is exiting from the funnel. Excessive filtration time could result in some loss of VCM. The wet resin sample is weighed into a tared 20-ml vial with THF or DMAC as described earlier for resin samples (8.2.1) and treated the same as the resin sample. A sample of the wet resin is used to determine total solids as required for calculating the residual VCM (Section 8.3.4).</P>
              <P>8.2.3 Latex and Resin Solvent Solutions. Samples must be thoroughly mixed. Weigh 1.00 ±0.01 g of the latex or resin-solvent solution into a 20-ml vial containing 9.00 ±0.01 g of THF or DMAC as for the resin samples (8.2.1). Cap and shake until complete solution is obtained. Determine the total solids of the latex or resin solution sample (Section 8.3.4).</P>

              <P>8.3.1.5 Attenuation. Set attenuation to yield desired peak height depending on sample VCM content.</P>
              <P>8.3.2 Chromatographic Analyses.</P>
              <P>a. Sample Injection. Remove needle from 50-microliter syringe. Open sample vial and draw 50-microliters of THF or DMAC sample recovery solution into the syringe. Recap sample vial. Attach needle to the syringe and while holding the syringe vertically (needle uppermost), eject 40 microliters into an absorbent tissue. Wipe needle with tissue. Now inject 10 microliters into chromatograph system. Repeat the injection until two consecutive values for the height of the vinyl chloride peak do not vary more than 5 percent. Use the average value for these two peak heights to compute the sample concentration.</P>

              <P>8.3.4 Determination of Total Solids (TS). For wet resin, resin solution, and PVC latex samples, determine the TS for each sample by accurately weighing approximately 3 to 5 grams of sample into a tared aluminum pan. The initial procedure is as follows:</P>
              <P>a. Where water is the major volatile component: Tare the weighing dish, and add 3 to 5 grams of sample to the dish. Weigh to the nearest milligram.</P>
              <P>b. Where volatile solvent is the major volatile component: Transfer a portion of the sample to a 20-ml screw cap vial and cap immediately. Weigh the vial to the nearest milligram. Uncap the vial and transfer a 3- to 5-gram portion of the sample to a tared aluminum weighing dish. Recap the vial and reweigh to the nearest milligram. The vial weight loss is the sample weight.</P>

              <P>To continue, place the weighing pan in a 130 °C oven for 1 hour. Remove the dish and allow to cool to room temperature in a desiccator. Weigh the pan to the nearest 0.1 mg. Total solids is the weight of material in the aluminum pan after heating divided by the net weight of sample added to the pan originally times 100.

              <P>9.1 Preparation of Standards. Prepare a 1 percent by weight (approximate) solution of vinyl chloride in THF or DMAC by bubbling vinyl chloride gas from a cylinder into a tared 125-ml glass-stoppered flask containing THF or DMAC. The weight of vinyl chloride to be added should be calculated prior to this operation, i.e., 1 percent of the weight of THF or DMAC contained in the tared flask. This must be carried out in a laboratory hood. Adjust the vinyl chloride flow from the cylinder so that the vinyl chloride dissolves essentially completely in the THF or DMAC and is not blown to the atmosphere. Take particular care not to volatize any of the solution. Stopper the flask and swirl the solution to effect complete mixing. Weigh the stoppered flask to nearest 0.1 mg to determine the exact amount of vinyl chloride added.</P>
              <P>Pipet 10 ml of the approximately 1 percent solution into a 100-ml glass-stoppered volumetric flask, and add THF or DMAC to fill to the mark. Cap the flask and invert 10 to 20 times. This solution contains approximately 1,000 ppm by weight of vinyl chloride (note the exact concentration).</P>
              <P>Pipet 50-, 10-, 5-, 1-, 0.5-, and 0.1-ml aliquots of the approximately 1,000 ppm solution into 10 ml glass stoppered volumetric flasks. Dilute to the mark with THF or DMAC, cap the flasks and invert each 10 to 20 times. These solutions contain approximately 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, and 1 ppm vinyl chloride. Note the exact concentration of each one. These standards are to be kept under refrigeration in stoppered bottles, and must be renewed every 3 months.</P>

Dilute to the mark with water.</P>
              <P>10.3 Calibration Curve. Analyze a 0.8 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> blank and each standard solution according to the procedures outlined in section 11.4.1. Repeat this procedure on each standard solution until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value. Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak height of each standard solution. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is As contamination of a reagent or carry-over of As from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding final total As weight in the solution.</P>

              <P>10.4 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 mg As for the high-level procedure) must be less than 7 percent for all standards.</P>

              <P>11.2 Sample Preparation.</P>

              <P>11.2.1 Container Number 1 (Filter). Place the filter and loose particulate matter in a 150 ml beaker. Also, add the filtered solid material from Container Number 2 (see Section 11.2.2). Add 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH. Then stir and warm on a hot plate at low heat (do not boil) for about 15 minutes. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E>, bring to a boil, then simmer for about 15 minutes. Filter the solution through a glass fiber filter. Wash with hot water, and catch the filtrate in a clean 150 ml beaker. Boil the filtrate, and evaporate to dryness. Cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and then warm and stir. Allow to cool. Transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.</P>
              <P>11.2.2 Container Number 2 (Probe Wash).</P>
              <P>11.2.2.1 Filter (using a glass fiber filter) the contents of Container Number 2 into a 200 ml volumetric flask. Combine the filtered (solid) material with the contents of Container Number 1 (Filter).</P>

              <P>11.2.2.2 Dilute the filtrate to exactly 200 ml with water. Then pipet 50 ml into a 150 ml beaker. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E>, bring to a boil, and evaporate to dryness. Allow to cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and then warm and stir. Allow the solution to cool, transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.</P>

              <P>11.2.3 Container Number 4 (Impinger Solution). Transfer the contents of Container Number 4 to a 500 ml volumetric flask, and <PRTPAGE P="293"/>dilute to exactly 500-ml with water. Pipet 50 ml of the solution into a 150-ml beaker. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E>, bring to a boil, and evaporate to dryness. Allow to cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and then warm and stir. Allow the solution to cool, transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.</P>
              <P>11.2.4 Filter Blank. Cut each filter into strips, and treat each filter individually as directed in Section 11.2.1, beginning with the sentence, “Add 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH.”</P>
              <P>11.2.5 Sodium Hydroxide and Water Blanks. Treat separately 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and 50 ml water, as directed under Section 11.2.3, beginning with the sentence, “Pipet 50 ml of the solution into a 150-ml beaker.”</P>
              <P>11.3 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current.

              <P>11.4 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.2 through 10.4.</P>

              <P>11.4.1 Arsenic Samples. Analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of each diluted sample (from Sections 11.2.1 through 11.2.3) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If applicable, follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.4.1.1. If the sample concentration falls outside the range of the calibration curve, make an appropriate dilution with 0.8 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> so that the final concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the calibration curve, determine the arsenic concentration in each sample fraction.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>11.4.1.1 Arsenic Determination at Low Concentration. The lower limit of flame AAS is 10 µg As/ml. If the arsenic concentration of any sample is at a lower level, use the graphite furnace or vapor generator which is available as an accessory component. Flame, graphite furnace, or vapor generators may be used for samples whose concentrations are between 10 and 30 µg/ml. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in the use of such equipment.</P>

              <P>11.4.1.1.1 Vapor Generator Procedure. Place a sample containing between 0 and 5 µg of arsenic in the reaction tube, and dilute to 15 ml with water. Since there is some trial and error involved in this procedure, it may be necessary to screen the samples by conventional atomic absorption until an approximate concentration is determined. After determining the approximate concentration, adjust the volume of the sample accordingly. Pipet 15 ml of concentrated HCl into each tube. Add 1 ml of 30 percent KI solution. Place the reaction tube into a 50 °C (120 °F) water bath for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Connect the reaction tube to the vapor generator assembly. When the instrument response has returned to baseline, inject 5.0 ml of 5 percent NaBH<E T="52">4</E>, and integrate the resulting spectrophotometer signal over a 30-second time period.</P>

              <P>11.4.1.1.2 Graphite Furnace Procedure. Dilute the digested sample so that a 5 ml aliquot contains less than 1.5 µg of arsenic. Pipet 5 ml of this digested solution into a 10-ml volumetric flask. Add 1 ml of the 1 percent nickel nitrate solution, 0.5 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and 1 ml of the 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and dilute to 10 ml with water. The sample is now ready for analysis.</P>
              <P>11.4.1.2 Run a blank (0.8 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>) and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.</P>
              <P>11.4.1.3 Determine the arsenic concentration in the filter blank (i.e., the average of the two blank values from each lot).</P>
              <P>11.4.2 Container Number 3 (Silica Gel). This step may be conducted in the field. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g; record this weight.</P>

              </NOTE>

              <P>10.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 5, 10, and 25 ml of the stock As solution into separate 100-ml volumetric flasks. Add 10 ml KCl solution and dilute to the mark with 0.5 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>. This will give standard concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 250 µg As/ml. For low-level arsenic samples that require the use of a graphite furnace or vapor generator, follow the procedures in Section 11.3:1. Dilute 10 ml of KCl solution to 100 ml with 0.5 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> and use as a reagent blank.</P>

              <P>10.2 Calibration Curve. Analyze the reagent blank and each standard solution according to the procedures outlined in Section 11.3. Repeat this procedure on each standard solution until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value. Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak heights of each standard solution. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Hg contamination of a reagent or carry-over of As from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the <PRTPAGE P="300"/>corresponding final total As weight in the solution.</P>
              <P>10.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations must be less than 7 percent for all standards.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>

              <P>11.1 Sample Preparation. Weigh 50 to 500 mg of finely pulverized sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample into the Teflon cup of the digestion bomb, and add 2 ml each of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E> and HF. Seal the bomb immediately to prevent the loss of any volatile arsenic compounds that may form. Heat in an oven at 105 °C (221 °F) for 2 hours. Remove the bomb from the oven and allow to cool. Using a Teflon filter, quantitatively filter the digested sample into a 50-ml polypropylene volumetric flask. Rinse the bomb three times with small portions of 0.5 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and filter the rinses into the flask. Add 5 ml of KCl solution to the flask, and dilute to 50 ml with 0.5 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>.</P>
              <P>11.2 Spectrophotometer Preparation.</P>
              <P>11.2.1 Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current. Adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.</P>
              <P>11.2.2 Develop a spectrophotometer calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.2 and 10.3.</P>

              <P>11.3 Arsenic Determination. Analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of each diluted sample (from Section 11.1) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If applicable, follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.3.1. If the sample concentration falls outside the range of the calibration curve, make an appropriate dilution with 0.5 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> so that the final concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the calibration curve, determine the As concentration in each sample.</P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.</P>
              </NOTE>
              <P>11.3.1 Arsenic Determination at Low Concentration. The lower limit of flame AAS is 10 µg As/ml. If the arsenic concentration of any sample is at a lower level, use the vapor generator or graphite furnace which is available as an accessory component. Flame, graphite furnace, or vapor generators may be used for samples whose concentrations are between 10 and 30 µg/ml. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in the use of such equipment.</P>

              <P>11.3.1.1 Vapor Generator Procedure. Place a sample containing between 0 and 5 µg of arsenic in the reaction tube, and dilute to 15 ml with water. Since there is some trial and error involved in this procedure, it may be necessary to screen the samples by conventional AAS until an approximate concentration is determined. After determining the approximate concentration, adjust the volume of the sample accordingly. Pipet 15 ml of concentrated HCl into each tube. Add 1 ml of 30 percent KI solution. Place the reaction tube into a 50 °C (120 °F) water bath for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Connect the reaction tube to the vapor generator assembly. When the instrument response has returned to baseline, inject 5.0 ml of 5 percent NaBH<E T="52">4</E> and integrate the resulting spectrophotometer signal over a 30-second time period.</P>

              <P>11.3.1.2 Graphite Furnace Procedure. Pipet 5 ml of the digested solution into a 10-ml volumetric flask. Add 1 ml of the 1 percent nickel nitrate solution, 0.5 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and 1 ml of the 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>, and dilute to 10 ml with water. The sample is now ready to inject in the furnace for analysis.</P>
              <P>11.4 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.</P>

              </NOTE>

              <P>10.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Transfer 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, and 20.0 ml of standard arsenic solution (10 µg/ml) to each of seven 50-ml volumetric flasks.

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>
              <P>11.1 Sample Preparation.</P>

              <P>11.1.1 Weigh 1.0 g of finely pulverized sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample to a 300 ml Erlenmeyer flask and add 15 ml of HNO<E T="52">3</E>, 4 ml HCl, 2 ml HF, 3 ml HClO<E T="52">4</E>, and 15 ml H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>, in the order listed. In a HClO<E T="52">4</E> fume hood, heat on a hot plate to decompose the sample. Then heat while swirling over an open flame until dense white fumes evolve. Cool, add 15 ml of water, swirl to hydrate the H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> completely, and add several boiling granules. Cool to room temperature.</P>
              <P>11.1.2 Add 1 g of KBr, 1 g hydrazine sulfate, and 50 ml HCl. Immediately attach the distillation head with thermometer and dip the side arm into a 50-ml graduated cylinder containing 25 ml of water and 2 ml of bromine water. Keep the graduated cylinder immersed in a beaker of cold water during distillation. Distill until the temperature of the vapor in the flask reaches 107 °C (225 °F). When distillation is complete, remove the flask from the hot plate, and simultaneously wash down the side arm with water as it is removed from the cylinder.</P>

              <P>11.1.3 If the expected arsenic content is in the range of 0.0020 to 0.10 percent, dilute the distillate to the 50-ml mark of the cylinder with water, stopper, and mix. Transfer a 5.0-ml aliquot to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of water and a boiling granule. Place the flask on a hot plate, and heat gently until the bromine is expelled and the color of methyl orange indicator persists upon the addition of 1 to 2 drops. Cool the flask to room temperature. Neutralize just to the yellow color of the indicator with dropwise additions of NH<E T="52">4</E>OH. Bring back to the red color by dropwise addition of dilute HCl, and add 10 ml excess. Proceed with the molybdenum blue color development as described in Section 11.2.</P>

              <P>11.1.4 If the expected arsenic content is in the range of 0.0002 to 0.0010 percent As, transfer either the entire initial distillate or the measured remaining distillate from Section 11.1.2 to a 250-ml beaker. Wash the cylinder with two successive portions of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E>, adding each portion to the distillate in the beaker. Add 4 ml of concentrated HClO<E T="52">4</E>, a boiling granule, and cover with a flat watch glass placed slightly to one side. Boil gently on a hot plate until the volume is reduced to approximately 10 ml. Add 3 ml of HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and continue the evaporation until HClO<E T="52">4</E> is refluxing on the beaker cover. Cool <PRTPAGE P="306"/>briefly, rinse the underside of the watch glass and the inside of the beaker with about 3-5 ml of water, cover, and continue the evaporation to expel all but 2 ml of the HClO<E T="52">4</E>.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

                <P>If the solution appears cloudy due to a small amount of antimony distilling over, add 4 ml of 50 percent HCl and 5 ml of water, cover, and warm gently until clear. If cloudiness persists, add 5 ml of HNO<E T="52">3</E> and 2 ml H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>. Continue the evaporation of volatile acids to solubilize the antimony until dense white fumes of H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> appear. Retain at least 1 ml of the H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>11.1.5 To the 2 ml of HClO<E T="52">4</E> solution or 1 ml of H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> solution, add 15 ml of water, boil gently for 2 minutes, and then cool. Proceed with the molybdenum blue color development by neutralizing the solution directly in the beaker just to the yellow indicator color by dropwise addition of NH<E T="52">4</E>OH. Obtain the red color by dropwise addition of dilute HCl. Transfer the solution to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the beaker successively with 10 ml of dilute HCl, followed by several small portions of water. At this point the volume of solution in the flask should be no more than 40 ml. Continue with the color development as described in Section 11.2.</P>
              <P>11.2 Analysis.</P>
              <P>11.2.1 Add 1 ml of KBrO<E T="52">3</E> solution to the flask and heat on a low-temperature hot plate to about 50 °C (122 °F) to oxidize the arsenic and methyl orange. Add 5.0 ml of ammonium molybdate solution to the warm solution and mix. Add 2.0 ml of hydrazine sulfate solution, dilute until the solution comes within the neck of the flask, and mix. Place the flask in a 400 ml beaker, 80 percent full of boiling water, for 10 minutes. Enough heat must be supplied to prevent the water bath from cooling much below the boiling point upon inserting the volumetric flask. Remove the flask, cool to room temperature, dilute to the mark, and mix.</P>
              <P>11.2.2 Transfer a suitable portion of the reference solution to an absorption cell, and adjust the spectrophotometer to the initial setting using a light band centered at 660 nm. While maintaining this spectrophotometer adjustment, take the readings of the calibration solutions followed by the samples.</P>

              <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of the polonium-210 content of particulate matter samples collected from stationary source exhaust stacks, and for the use of these data to calculate polonium-210 emissions from individual sources and from all affected sources at a facility.</P>
              <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

              <P>A particulate matter sample, collected according to Method 5, is analyzed for polonium-210 content: the polonium-210 in the sample is put in solution, deposited on a metal disc, and the radioactive disintegration rate measured. Polonium in acid solution spontaneously deposits on surfaces of metals that are more electropositive than polonium. This principle is routinely used in the radiochemical analysis of polonium-210. Data reduction procedures are provided, allowing the calculation of polonium-210 emissions from individual sources and from all <PRTPAGE P="308"/>affected sources at a facility, using data obtained from Methods 2 and 5 and from the analytical procedures herein.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>Perform duplicate analyses of all samples, including background counts and Method 5 samples. Duplicate measurements are considered acceptable when the difference between them is less than two standard deviations as described in EPA 600/4-77-001 or subsequent revisions.</P>
              </NOTE>

              <P>11.1 Determination of Procedure Background. Background counts used in all equations are determined by performing the specific analysis required using the analytical reagents only. All procedure background counts and sample counts for the internal proportional counter should utilize a counting time of 100 minutes; for the alpha spectrometry system, 1000 minutes. These background counts should be performed no less frequently than once per 10 sample analyses.<PRTPAGE P="310"/>
              </P>
              <P>11.2 Determination of Instrument Background. Instrument backgrounds of the internal proportional counter and the alpha spectrometry system should be determined on a weekly basis. Instrument background should not exceed procedure background. If this occurs, it may be due to a malfunction or contamination, and should be corrected before use.</P>
              <P>11.4 Sample Preparation. Treat the Method 5 samples [<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the glass fiber filter (Container No. 1) and the acetone rinse (Container No. 2)] as follows:</P>
              <P>11.4.1 Container No. 1. Transfer the filter and any loose particulate matter from the sample container to a 150-ml Teflon beaker.</P>
              <P>11.4.2 Container No. 2. Note the level of liquid in the container, and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Transfer the contents to a 400-ml glass beaker. Add polonium-209 tracer solution to the glass beaker in an amount approximately equal to the amount of polonium-210 expected in the total particulate sample. Record the activity of the tracer solution added. Add 16 M nitric acid to the beaker to digest and loosen the residue.</P>

              <P>11.4.3 Transfer the contents of the glass beaker to the Teflon beaker containing the glass fiber filter. Rinse the glass beaker with 16 M HNO<E T="52">3</E>. If necessary, reduce the volume in the beaker by evaporation until all of the nitric acid HNO<E T="52">3</E> from the glass beaker has been transferred to the Teflon beaker.</P>

              <P>11.4.4 Add 30 ml of 29 M HF to the Teflon beaker and evaporate to near dryness on a hot plate in a properly operating hood.

              <P>11.4.7 Add 50 ml of 16 M HNO<E T="52">3</E> and 10 ml of 12 M perchloric acid to the Teflon beaker and heat until dense fumes of perchloric acid are evolved.</P>
              <P>11.4.8 Repeat steps 11.4.4 to 11.4.7 as necessary until sample is completely dissolved.</P>
              <P>11.4.9 Add 10 ml of 12 M HCl to the Teflon beaker and evaporate to dryness. Repeat additions and evaporations several times.</P>
              <P>11.4.10 Transfer the sample to a 250-ml volumetric flask and dilute to volume with 3 M HCl.</P>
              <P>11.5 Sample Screening. To avoid contamination of the alpha spectrometry system, check each sample as follows:</P>
              <P>11.5.1 Add 20 ml of 1 M HCl, 1 ml of the lanthanum carrier solution (0.1 mg La/ml), a 1 ml aliquot of the sample solution from Section 11.4.10, and 3 ml of 15 M ammonium hydroxide to a 250-ml beaker in the order listed. Allow this solution to stand for a minimum of 30 minutes.</P>
              <P>11.5.2 Filter the solution through a filter membrane using the suction filter apparatus. Wash the filter membrane with 10 ml of water and 5 ml of ethanol, and allow the filter membrane to air dry on the filter apparatus.</P>
              <P>11.5.3 Carefully remove the filter membrane and mount it, filtration side up, with double-side tape on the inner surface of a planchet. Place the planchet in an internal proportional counter, and count for 100 minutes.</P>
              <P>11.5.4 Calculate the activity of the sample using Eq. 111-4 in Section 12.5.</P>
              <P>11.5.5 Determine the aliquot volume of the sample solution from Section 11.4.10 to be analyzed for polonium-210, such that the aliquot contains an activity between 1 and 4 picocuries. Use Eq. 111-5 in Section 12.6.</P>
              <P>11.6 Preparation of Silver Disc for Spontaneous Electrodeposition.</P>
              <P>11.6.1 Clean both sides of the polished silver disc with silver cleaner and with degreaser.</P>
              <P>11.6.2 Place disc on absorbent paper and spray one side with epoxy spray enamel. This should be carried out in a well-ventilated area, with the disc lying flat to keep paint on one side only. Allow paint to dry for 24 hours before using disc for deposition.</P>
              <P>11.7 Sample Analysis.</P>

              <P>11.7.1 Add the aliquot of sample solution from Section 11.4.10 to be analyzed for polonium-210, the volume of which was determined in Section 11.5.5, to a suitable 200-ml container to be placed in a constant temperature bath.

              </FP>
              
              <P>This method provides the requirements for: (1) Stack monitoring and sample collection methods appropriate for radionuclides; (2) radiochemical methods which are used in determining the amounts of radionuclides collected by the stack sampling and; (3) quality assurance methods which are conducted in conjunction with these measurements. These methods are appropriate for emissions for stationary sources. A list of references is provided.</P>

              <P>Many different types of facilities release radionuclides into air. These radionuclides differ in the chemical and physical forms, half-lives and type of radiation emitted. The appropriate combination of sample extraction, collection and analysis for an individual radionuclide is dependent upon many interrelated factors including the mixture of other radionuclides present. Because of this wide range of conditions, no single method for monitoring or sample collection and analysis of a radionuclide is applicable to all types of facilities. Therefore, a series of methods based on “principles of measurement” are described for monitoring and sample collection and analysis which are applicable to the measurement of radionuclides found in effluent streams at stationary sources. This approach provides the user with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate combination of monitoring and sample collection and analysis methods which are applicable to the effluent stream to be measured.

              <P>Monitoring and sample collection methods are described based on “principles of monitoring and sample collection” which are applicable to the measurement of radionuclides from effluent streams at stationary sources. <PRTPAGE P="314"/>Radionuclides of most elements will be in the particulate form in these effluent streams and can be readily collected using a suitable filter media. Radionuclides of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, the noble gases and in some circumstances iodine will be in the gaseous form. Radionuclides of these elements will require either the use of an in-line or off-line monitor to directly measure the radionuclides, or suitable sorbers, condensers or bubblers to collect the radionuclides.</P>
              <P>2.1 Radionuclides as Particulates. The extracted effluent stream is passed through a filter media to remove the particulates. The filter must have a high efficiency for removal of sub-micron particles. The guidance in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 (section 6.6.2 Filter media) shall be followed in using filter media to collect particulates (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18 of this part).</P>

              <P>Tritium in the gaseous form may be measured directly in the sample stream using Method B-1, collected as a gas sample or may be oxidized using a metal catalyst to tritiated water and collected as described above.</P>
              <P>2.2.2 Radionuclides of Iodine. Iodine is collected from an extracted sample by sorption or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectors may include charcoal, impregnated charcoal, metal zeolite and caustic solutions.</P>

              <P>A series of methods based on “principles of measurement” are described which are applicable to the analysis of radionuclides collected from airborne effluent streams at stationary sources. These methods are applicable only under the conditions stated and within the limitations described. Some methods specify that only a single radionuclide be present in the sample or the chemically separated sample. This condition should be interpreted to mean that no other radionuclides are present in quantities which would interfere with the measurement.</P>
              <P>Also identified (Table 1) are methods for a selected list of radionuclides. The listed radionuclides are those which are most commonly used and which have the greatest potential for causing dose to members of the public. Use of methods based on principles of measurement other than those described in this section must be approved in advance of use by the Administrator. For radionuclides not listed in Table 1, any of the described methods may be used provided the user can demonstrate that the applicability conditions of the method have been met.</P>
              <P>The type of method applicable to the analysis of a radionuclide is dependent upon the type of radiation emitted, i.e., alpha, beta or gamma. Therefore, the methods described below are grouped according to principles of measurements for the analysis of alpha, beta and gamma emitting radionuclides.</P>
              <P>3.1 Methods for Alpha Emitting Radionuclides</P>
              <P>3.1.1 Method A-1, Radiochemistry-Alpha Spectrometry.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix using radiochemical techniques. The procedure may involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet in a very thin film by electrodeposition or by coprecipitation on a very small amount of carrier, such as lanthanum fluoride. The deposited element is then counted with an alpha spectrometer. The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by the number of alpha counts in the appropriate energy region. A <PRTPAGE P="315"/>correction for chemical yield and counting efficiency is made using a standardized radioactive nuclide (tracer) of the same element. If a radioactive tracer is not available for the element of interest, a predetermined chemical yield factor may be used.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicability:</E> This method is applicable for determining the activity of any alpha-emitting radionuclide, regardless of what other radionuclides are present in the sample provided the chemical separation step produces a very thin sample and removes all other radionuclides which could interfere in the spectral region of interest. APHA-605(2), ASTM-D-3972(13).</P>
              <P>3.1.2 Method A-2, Radiochemistry-Alpha Counting.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix using radiochemistry. The procedure may involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet in a thin film and counted with an alpha counter. A correction for chemical yield (if necessary) is made. The alpha count rate measures the total activity of all emitting radionuclides of the separated element.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicability:</E> This method is applicable for the measurement of any alpha-emitting radionuclide, provided no other alpha emitting radionuclide is present in the separated sample. It may also be applicable for determining compliance, when other radionuclides of the separated element are present, provided that the calculated emission rate is assigned to the radionuclide which could be present in the sample that has the highest dose conversion factor. IDO-12096(18).</P>
              <P>3.1.3 Method A-3, Direct Alpha Spectrometry.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted directly on an alpha spectrometer. The sample must be thin enough and collected on the surface of the filter so that any absorption of alpha particle energy in the sample or the filter, which would degrade the spectrum, is minimal.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicability:</E> This method is applicable to simple mixtures of alpha emitting radionuclides and only when the amount of particulates collected on the filter paper are relatively small and the alpha spectra is adequately resolved. Resolutions should be 50 keV (FWHM) or better, ASTM-D-3084(16).</P>
              <P>3.1.4 Method A-4, Direct Alpha Counting (Gross alpha determination).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted with an alpha counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-absorption is not significant and the filter must be of such a nature that the particles are retained on the surface.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicability:</E> Gross alpha determinations may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only (1) when it is known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide, or the identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the sample are well-known, and (2) measurements using either Method A-1, A-2 or A-5 have shown that this method provides a reasonably accurate measurement of the emission rate. Gross alpha measurements are applicable to unidentified mixtures of radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7. APHA-601(3), ASTM-D-1943(10).</P>
              <P>3.1.5 Method A-5, Chemical Determination of Uranium.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> Uranium may be measured chemically by either colorimetry or fluorometry. In both procedures, the sample is dissolved, the uranium is oxidized to the hexavalent form and extracted into a suitable solvent. Impurities are removed from the solvent layer. For colorimetry, dibenzoylmethane is added, and the uranium is measured by the absorbance in a colorimeter. For fluorometry, a portion of the solution is fused with a sodium fluoride-lithium fluoride flux and the uranium is determined by the ultraviolet activated fluorescence of the fused disk in a fluorometer.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicability:</E> This method is applicable to the measurements of emission rates of uranium when the isotopic ratio of the uranium radionuclides is well known. ASTM-E-318(15), ASTM-D-2907(14).</P>
              <P>3.1.6 Method A-6, Radon-222—Continuous Gas Monitor.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> Radon-222 is measured directly in a continuously extracted sample stream by passing the air stream through a calibrated scintillation cell. Prior to the scintillation cell, the air stream is treated to remove particulates and excess moisture. The alpha particles from radon-222 and its decay products strike a zinc sulfide coating on the inside of the scintillation cell producing light pulses. The light pulses are detected by a photomultiplier tube which generates electrical pulses. These pulses are processed by the system electronics and the read out is in pCi/l of radon-222.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicability:</E> This method is applicable to the measurement of radon-222 in effluent streams which do not contain significant quantities of radon-220. Users of this method should calibrate the monitor in a radon calibration chamber at least twice per year. The background of the monitor should also be checked periodically by operating the instrument in a low radon environment. EPA 520/1-89-009(24).</P>
              <P>3.1.7 Method A-7, Radon-222-Alpha Track Detectors</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> Radon-222 is measured directly in the effluent stream using alpha track detectors (ATD). The alpha particles emitted by <PRTPAGE P="316"/>radon-222 and its decay products strike a small plastic strip and produce submicron damage tracks. The plastic strip is placed in a caustic solution that accentuates the damage tracks which are counted using a microscope or automatic counting system. The number of tracks per unit area is correlated to the radon concentration in air using a conversion factor derived from data generated in a radon calibration facility.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicability:</E> Prior approval from EPA is required for use of this method. This method is only applicable to effluent streams which do not contain significant quantities of radon-220, unless special detectors are used to discriminate against radon-220. This method may be used only when ATDs have been demonstrated to produce data comparable to data obtained with Method A-6. Such data should be submitted to EPA when requesting approval for the use of this method. EPA 520/1-89-009(24).</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> An ionization chamber containing a specific volume of gas which flows at a given flow rate through the chamber is used.

              <P>3.2.2 Method B-2, Direct Counting With In-line or Off-line Beta Detectors.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> The beta detector is placed directly in the effluent stream (in-line) or an extracted sample of the effluent stream is passed through a chamber containing a beta detector (off-line). The activities of the radionuclides present in the effluent stream are determined from the beta count rate, and a knowledge of the radionuclides present and the relationship of the gross beta count rate and the specific radionuclide concentration.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicability:</E> This method is applicable only to radionuclides with maximum beta particle energies greater then 0.2 MeV. This method may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only when it is known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide or the identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the effluent stream are well known. Specific radionuclide analysis of periodic grab samples may be used to identify the types and quantities of radionuclides present and to establish the relationship between specific radionuclide analyses and gross beta count rates.</P>
              <P>This method is applicable to unidentified mixtures of gaseous radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Principle:</E> The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix by radiochemistry. This may involve precipitation, distillation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet, and counted with a beta counter. Corrections for chemical yield, and decay (if necessary) are made. The beta count rate determines the total activity of all radionuclides of the separated element. This method may also involve the radiochemical separation and counting of a daughter element, after a suitable period of ingrowth, in which case it is specific for the parent nuclide.</P>

                <E T="03">Principle:</E> An aliquot of a collected sample or the result of some other chemical separation or processing technique is added to a liquid scintillation “cocktail” which is viewed by photomultiplier tubes in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The spectrometer is adjusted to establish a channel or “window” for the pulse energy appropriate to the nuclide of interest. The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by the counting rate in the appropriate energy channel. Corrections are made for chemical yield where separations are made.<PRTPAGE P="317"/>
              </P>

              <P>• <E T="03">Solid-State Counters.</E> Semiconductor materials, such as silicon surface-barrier p-n junctions, act as solid ionization chambers. The alpha particles interact which the detector producing electron hole pairs. The charged pair is collected by an applied electrical field and the resulting electrical pulses are counted.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Alpha Spectrometers.</E> Semiconductor detectors used in conjunction with multichannel analyzers for energy discrimination.</P>
              <P>3.5.2 Beta Counting:</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Ionization Chambers.</E> These chambers contain the beta-emitting nuclide in gaseous form. The ionization current produced is measured.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Geiger-Muller (GM) Counters-or Gas Flow Proportional Counters.</E> The beta particles cause ionization in the counting gas and the resulting electrical pulses are counted. Proportional gas flow counters which are heavily shielded by lead or other metal, and provided with an anti-coincidence shield to reject cosmic rays, are called low background beta counters.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Scintillation Counters.</E> The beta particles transfer energy to a scintillator resulting in a production of light photons, which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light photon to electrical pulses which are counted. This may involve the use of anthracene crystals, plastic scintillator, or liquid scintillation solutions with organic phosphors.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Liquid Scintillation Spectrometers.</E> Liquid scintillation counters which use two photomultiplier tubes in coincidence to reduce background counts. This counter may also electronically discriminate among pulses of a given range of energy.</P>
              <P>3.5.3 Gamma Counting:</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Low-Resolution Gamma Spectrometers.</E> The gamma rays interact with thallium activated sodium iodide or cesium iodide crystal resulting in the release of light photons which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light pulses to electrical pulses proportional to the energy of the gamma ray. Multi-channel analyzers are used to separate and store the pulses according to the energy absorbed in the crystal.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">High-Resolution gamma Spectrometers.</E> Gamma rays interact with a lithium-drifted (Ge(Li)) or high-purity germanium (HPGe) semiconductor detectors resulting in a production of electron-hole pairs. The charged pair is collected by an applied electrical field. A very stable low noise preamplifier amplifies the pulses of electrical charge resulting from the gamma photon interactions. Multichannel analyzers or computers are used to separate and store the pulses according to the energy absorbed in the crystal.</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Single Channel Analyzers.</E> Thallium activated sodium iodide crystals used with a single window analyzer. Pulses from the photomultiplier tubes are separated in a single predetermined energy range.</P>
              <P>3.5.4 Calibration of Counters. Counters are calibrated for specific radionuclide measurements using a standard of the radionuclide under either identical or very similar conditions as the sample to be counted. For gamma spectrometers a series of standards covering the energy range of interest may be used to construct a calibration curve relating gamma energy to counting efficiency.</P>
              <P>In those cases where a standard is not available for a radionuclide, counters may be calibrated using a standard with energy characteristics as similar as possible to the radionuclide to be measured. For gross alpha and beta measurements of the unidentified mixtures of radionuclides, alpha counters are calibrated with a natural uranium standard and beta counters with a cesium-137 standard. The standard must contain the same weight and distribution of solids as the samples, and be mounted in an identical manner. If the samples contain variable amounts of solids, calibration curves relating weight of solids present to counting efficiency are prepared. Standards other than those prescribed may be used provided it can be shown that such standards are more applicable to the radionuclide mixture measured.</P>
              <P>3.6 Radiochemical Methods for Selected Radionuclides. Methods for a selected list of radionuclides are listed in Table 1. The radionuclides listed are those which are most commonly used and which have the greatest potential for causing doses to members of the public. For radionuclides not listed in Table 1, methods based on any of the applicable “principles of measurement” described in section 3.1 through 3.4 may be used.</P>
              <P>3.7 Applicability of Gross Alpha and Beta Measurements to Unidentified Mixtures of Radionuclides. Gross alpha and beta measurements may be used as a screening measurement as a part of an emission measurement program to identify the need to do specific radionuclide analyses or to confirm or verify that unexpected radionuclides are not being released in significant quantities.</P>

              <P>Gross alpha (Method A-4) or gross beta (Methods B-2 or B-4) measurements may also be used for the purpose of comparing the measured concentrations in the effluent stream with the limiting “Concentration Levels for Environmental Compliance” in table 2 of appendix E. For unidentified mixtures, the measured concentration value shall be compared with the lowest environmental concentration limit for any radionuclide which is not known to be absent from the effluent stream.<PRTPAGE P="319"/>

This program shall assure that the emission measurements are representative, and are of known precision and accuracy and shall include administrative controls to assure prompt response when emission measurements indicate unexpectedly large emissions. The program shall consist of a system of policies, organizational responsibilities, written procedures, data quality specifications, audits, corrective actions and reports. This quality assurance program shall include the following program elements:</P>
              <P>4.1 The organizational structure, functional responsibilities, levels of authority and lines of communications for all activities related to the emissions measurement program shall be identified and documented.</P>
              <P>4.2 Administrative controls shall be prescribed to ensure prompt response in the event that emission levels increase due to unplanned operations.</P>
              <P>4.3 The sample collection and analysis procedures used in measuring the emissions shall be described including where applicable:</P>
              <P>4.3.1 Identification of sampling sites and number of sampling points, including the rationale for site selections.</P>
              <P>4.3.2 A description of sampling probes and representativeness of the samples.</P>

              <P>4.3.6 A description of the sample flow rate measurement systems or procedures, including calibration procedures and frequency of calibration.</P>
              <P>4.3.7 A description of the effluent flow rate measurement procedures, including frequency of measurements, calibration procedures and frequency of calibration.</P>
              <P>4.4 The objectives of the quality assurance program shall be documented and shall state the required precision, accuracy and completeness of the emission measurement data including a description of the procedures used to assess these parameters. Accuracy is the degree of agreement of a measurement with a true or known value. Precision is a measure of the agreement among individual measurements of the same parameters under similar conditions. Completeness is a measure of the amount of valid data obtained compared to the amount expected under normal conditions.</P>
              <P>4.5 A quality control program shall be established to evaluate and track the quality of the emissions measurement data against preset criteria. The program should include where applicable a system of replicates, spiked samples, split samples, blanks and control charts. The number and frequency of such quality control checks shall be identified.</P>

              <P>4.6 A sample tracking system shall be established to provide for positive identification of samples and data through all phases <PRTPAGE P="320"/>of the sample collection, analysis and reporting system. Sample handling and preservation procedures shall be established to maintain the integrity of samples during collection, storage and analysis.</P>

              <P>2.1 Measurement and Calculation of Radon Flux from Uranium Mill Tailings Piles.</P>
              <P>2.1.1 Frequency of Flux Measurement. A single set of radon flux measurements may be made, or if the owner or operator chooses, more frequent measurements may be made over a one year period. These measurements may involve quarterly, monthly or weekly intervals. All radon measurements shall be made as described in paragraphs 2.1.2 through 2.1.6 except that for measurements made over a one year period, the requirement of paragraph 2.1.4(c) shall not apply. The mean radon flux from the pile shall be the arithmetic mean of the mean radon flux for each measurement period. The weather conditions, moisture content of the tailings and area of the pile covered by water existing at the time of the measurement shall be chosen so as to provide measurements representative of the long term radon flux from the pile and shall be subject to EPA review and approval.</P>

              <P>2.1.2 Distribution of Flux Measurements. The distribution and number of radon flux measurements required on a pile will depend on clearly defined areas of the pile (called regions) that can have significantly different radon fluxes due to surface conditions. The mean radon flux shall be determined for each individual region of the pile. Regions that shall be considered for operating mill tailings piles are:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(a) Water covered areas,</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(b) Water saturated areas (beaches),</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(c) Dry top surface areas, and</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(d) Sides, except where earthen material is used in dam construction.</FP>
              
              <P>For mill tailings after disposal the pile shall be considered to consist of only one region.</P>

              <P>2.1.3 Number of Flux Measurements. Radon flux measurements shall be made within each region on the pile, except for those areas covered with water. Measurements shall be made at regularly spaced locations across the surface of the region, realizing that surface roughness will prohibit measurements in some areas of a region. The minimum number of flux measurements considered necessary to determine a representative mean radon flux value for each type of region on an operating pile is:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(a) Water covered area—no measurements required as radon flux is assumed to be zero,</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(b) Water saturated beaches—100 radon flux measurements,</FP>

              <P>For a mill tailings pile after disposal which consists of only one region a minimum of 100 measurements are required.</P>

              <P>2.1.4 Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. The following restrictions are placed on making radon flux measurements:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a rainfall.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurements period, the measurement is invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has washed away or if the collector is surrounded by water.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature is below 35 °F or if the ground is frozen.</FP>
              
              <P>2.1.5 Areas of Pile Regions. The approximate area of each region of the pile shall be determined in units of square meters.</P>
              <P>2.1.6 Radon Flux Measurement. Measuring radon flux involves the adsorption of radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector. The radon collector is placed on the surface of the pile area to be measured and allowed to collect radon for a time period of 24 hours. The radon collected on the charcoal is measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. The detailed measurement procedure provided in appendix A of EPA 520/5-85-0029(1) shall be used to measure the radon flux on uranium mill tailings, except the surface of the tailings shall not be penetrated by the lip of the radon collector as directed in the procedure, rather the collector shall be carefully positioned on a flat surface with soil or tailings used to seal the edge.</P>

              <P>2.1.7 Calculations. The mean radon flux for each region of the pile and for the total pile shall be calculated and reported as follows:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(a) The individual radon flux calculations shall be made as provided in appendix A EPA 86 (1). The mean radon flux for each region of the pile shall be calculated by summing all individual flux measurements for the region and dividing by the total number of flux measurements for the region.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(b) The mean radon flux for the total uranium mill tailings pile shall be calculated as follows.</FP>

              <P>2.1.8 Reporting. The results of individual flux measurements, the approximate locations on the pile, and the mean radon flux for each region and the mean radon flux for the total stack shall be included in the emission test report. Any condition or unusual event that occurred during the measurements that could significantly affect the results should be reported.</P>

              <P>3.1 Measurement and Calculation of the Mean Radon Flux. Radon flux measurements shall be made on phosphogypsum stacks as described below:</P>
              <P>3.1.1 Frequency of Measurements. A single set of radon flux measurements may be made after the phosphogypsum stack becomes inactive, or if the owner or operator chooses, more frequent measurements may be made over a one year period. These measurements may involve quarterly, monthly or weekly intervals. All radon measurements shall be made as described in paragraphs 3.1.2 through 3.1.6 except that for measurements made over a one year period, the requirement of paragraph 3.1.4(c) shall not apply. For measurements made over a one year period, the radon flux shall be the arithmetic mean of the mean radon flux for each measurement period.</P>

              <P>3.1.4 Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. The following restrictions are placed on making radon flux measurements:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a rainfall.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurement period, the measurement is invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has washed away or if the collector is surrounded by water.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature is below 35 °F or if the ground is frozen.</FP>

              <P>3.1.6 Radon Flux Measurements. Measuring radon flux involves the adsorption of radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector. The radon collector is placed on the surface of the stack area to be measured and allowed to collect radon for a time period of 24 hours. The radon collected on the charcoal is measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. The detailed measurement procedure provided in appendix A of EPA 520/5-85-0029(1) shall be used to measure the radon flux on phosphogypsum stacks, except the surface of the phosphogypsum shall not be penetrated by the lip of the radon collector as directed in the procedure, rather the collector shall be carefully positioned on a flat surface with soil or phosphogypsum used to seal the edge.</P>

              <P>3.1.7 Calculations. The mean radon flux for each region of the phosphogypsum stack and for the total stack shall be calculated and reported as follows:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(a) The individual radon flux calculations shall be made as provided in appendix A EPA 86 (1). The mean radon flux for each region of the stack shall be calculated by summing all individual flux measurements for the region and dividing by the total number of flux measurements for the region.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">(b) The mean radon flux for the total phosphogypsum stack shall be calculated as follows.</FP>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Procedure 1—Determination of Adequate Chromatographic Peak Resolution</HD>
              <P>In this method of dealing with resolution, the extent to which one chromatographic peak overlaps another is determined.</P>

              <P>For convenience, consider the range of the elution curve of each compound as running from −2σ to + 2σ. This range is used in other resolution criteria, and it contains 95.45 percent of the area of a normal curve. If two peaks are separated by a known distance, b, one can determine the fraction of the area of one curve that lies within the range of the other. The extent to which the elution curve of a contaminant compound overlaps the curve of a compound that is under analysis is found by integrating the contaminant curve <PRTPAGE P="325"/>over the limits b−2σ<E T="52">s</E> to b + 2σ<E T="52">s</E>, where σ<E T="52">s</E> is the standard deviation of the sample curve.</P>
              <P>This calculation can be simplified in several ways. Overlap can be determined for curves of unit area; then actual areas can be introduced. Desired integration can be resolved into two integrals of the normal distribution function for which there are convenient calculation programs and tables. An example would be Program 15 in Texas Instruments Program Manual ST1, 1975, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, Texas 75222.</P>
              <GPH DEEP="470" SPAN="2">

                <GID>EC01MY92.034</GID>
              </GPH>

              <P>In judging the suitability of alternate GC columns or the effects of altering chromatographic conditions, one can employ the area overlap as the resolution parameter with a specific maximum permissible value.<PRTPAGE P="327"/>
              </P>

              <P>The use of Gaussian functions to describe chromatographic elution curves is widespread. However, some elution curves are highly asymmetric. In cases where the sample peak is followed by a contaminant that has a leading edge that rises sharply but the curve then tails off, it may be possible to define an effective width for t<E T="52">c</E> as “twice the distance from the leading edge to a perpendicular line through the maxim of the contaminant curve, measured along a perpendicular bisection of that line.”</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Procedure 2—Procedure for Field Auditing GC Analysis</HD>
              <P>Responsibilities of audit supervisor and analyst at the source sampling site include the following:</P>
              <P>A. The audit supervisor verifies that audit cylinders are stored in a safe location both before and after the audit to prevent vandalism.</P>
              <P>B. At the beginning and conclusion of the audit, the analyst records each cylinder number and pressure. An audit cylinder is never analyzed when the pressure drops below 200 psi.</P>
              <P>C. During the audit, the analyst performs a minimum of two consecutive analyses of each audit cylinder gas. The audit must be conducted to coincide with the analysis of source test samples, normally immediately after GC calibration and prior to sample analyses.</P>
              <P>D. At the end of audit analyses, the audit supervisor requests the calculated concentrations from the analyst and compares the results with the actual audit concentrations. If each measured concentration agrees with the respective actual concentration within ±10 percent, he directs the analyst to begin analyzing source samples. Audit supervisor judgment and/or supervisory policy determine action when agreement is not within ±10 percent. When a consistent bias in excess of 10 percent is found, it may be possible to proceed with the sample analysis, with a corrective factor to be applied to the results at a later time. However, every attempt should be made to locate the cause of the discrepancy, as it may be misleading. The audit supervisor records each cylinder number, cylinder pressure (at the end of the audit), and all calculated concentrations. The individual being audited must not under any circumstance be told actual audit concentrations until calculated concentrations have been submitted to the audit supervisor.</P>

              <P>Facility owners or operators may estimate radionuclide emissions to the atmosphere for dose calculations instead of measuring emissions. Particulate emissions from mill tailings piles should be estimated using the procedures listed in reference re #2. All other emissions may be estimated by using the <PRTPAGE P="328"/>“Procedures” listed below, or using the method described in reference #1.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Procedure</HD>
              <P>To estimate emissions to the atmosphere:</P>
              <P>(a) Determine the amount (in curies) used at facilities for the period under consideration. Radioactive materials in sealed packages that remain unopened, and have not leaked during the assessment period should not be included in the calculation.</P>
              <P>(b) Multiply the amount used by the following factors which depend on the physical state of the radionuclide. They are:</P>
              <P>(i) 1 for gases;</P>
              <P>(ii) 10<E T="51">−3</E> for liquids or particulate solids; and</P>
              <P>(iii) 10<E T="51">−6</E> for solids.</P>
              <P>If any nuclide is heated to a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or more, boils at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or less, or is intentionally dispersed into the environment, it must be considered to be a gas.</P>
              <P>(c) If a control device is installed between the place of use and the point of release, multiply emissions from (b) by an adjustment factor. These are presented in Table 1.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix E to Part 61—Compliance Procedures Methods for Determining Compliance With Subpart I</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Purpose and Background</HD>
              <P>This Appendix provides simplified procedures to reduce the burden on Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees, and non-Department of Energy Federal facilities in determining compliance with 40 CFR part 61, subpart I. The procedures consist of a series of increasingly more stringent steps, depending on the facility's potential to exceed the standard.</P>

              <P>First, a facility can be found in compliance if the quantity of radioactive material possessed during the year is less than that listed in a table of annual possession quantities. A facility will also be in compliance if the average annual radionuclide emission concentration is less than that listed in a table of air concentration levels. If the facility is <PRTPAGE P="329"/>not in compliance by these tables, it can establish compliance by estimating a dose using screening procedure developed by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements with a radiological source term derived using EPA approved emission factors. These procedures are described in a “Guide for Determining Compliance with the Clean Air Act Standards for Radionuclide Emissions From NRC-Licensed and Non-DOE Federal Facilities.”</P>
              <P>A user-friendly computer program called COMPLY has been developed to reduce the burden on the regulated community. The Agency has also prepared a “User's Guide for the COMPLY Code” to assist the regulated community in using the code, and in handling more complex situations such as multiple release points. The basis for these compliance procedures are provided in “Background Information Document: Procedures Approved for Demonstrating Compliance with 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart I”. The compliance model is the highest level in the COMPLY computer code and provides for the most realistic assessment of dose by allowing the use of site-specific information.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Table of Annual Possession Quantity</HD>
              <P>(a) Table 1 may be used for determining if facilities are in compliance with the standard. The possession table can only be used if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) No person lives within 10 meters of any release point; and</P>
              <P>(ii) No milk, meat, or vegetables are produced within 100 meters of any release point.</P>
              <P>(b) Procedures described in Reference (1) shall be used to determine compliance or exemption from reporting by use of Table 2.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part sets forth the Administrator's approval and disapproval of State plans for the control of pollutants and facilities under section 111(d), and section 129 as applicable, of the Act, and the Administrator's promulgation of such plans or portions of plans thereof. Approval of a plan or any portion of a plan is based on a determination by the Administrator that it meets the requirements of section 111(d), and section 129 as applicable, of the Act and provisions of part 60 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) If a State does not submit a complete, approvable plan, the Administrator may then promulgate a substitute plan or part of a plan. The promulgated provision, plus the approved parts of the State plan, constitute the applicable plan for purposes of the act.</P>
              <P>(2) The part 60 subpart A of this chapter general provisions and appendices to part 60 apply to part 62, except as follows: 40 CFR 60.7(a)(1), 60.7(a)(3), and 60.8(a) and where special provisions set forth under the applicable subpart of this part shall apply instead of any conflicting provisions.</P>

              <P>(c) The Administrator will promulgate substitute provisions for the disapproved regulatory provisions only. If a nonregulatory provision is disapproved, however, it will be noted in this part and a detailed explanation will be sent to the State.<PRTPAGE P="364"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) All approved regulatory provisions of each plan are incorporated by reference in this part. Section 62.12 provides information on availability of applicable plans. The Administrator and State and local agencies shall enforce (1) regulatory provisions of a plan approved or promulgated by the Administrator, and (2) all permit conditions or denials issued in carrying out the approved or promulgated regulations for the review of designated facilities.</P>
              <P>(e) Each State's plan is dealt with in a separate subpart, with separate headings for different pollutants and facilities. The plans shall include an introductory section identifying the plan by name and the date of its submittal. Additional sections are included as necessary to specifically identify disapproved provisions, to set forth reasons for disapproval, and to set forth provisions of the plan promulgated by the Administrator. Except as otherwise specified, all supplemental information submitted to the Administrator with respect to any plan has been submitted by the Governor of the State.</P>
              <P>(f) Revisions to applicable plans will be included in this part when approved or promulgated by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(g) Substitute plans promulgated by the Administrator for States that do not have approved plans are contained in separate subparts that appear after the subparts for States. These Federal plans include sections identifying the applicability of the plan, emission limits, compliance schedules, recordkeeping and reporting, performance testing, and monitoring requirements.</P>

              <P>(b) The Administrator will not promulgate provisions for disapproved State or local agency procedures for testing, inspection, investigation, or detection. However, detailed critiques of such portions will be provided to the State.</P>

                <P>The Illinois Plan for implementing the Federal Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Emission Guidelines to control air emissions from existing landfills in the State was submitted on July 21, 1998. The Illinois rules for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills are primarily found in Title 35: Environmental Protection; Subtitle B: Air Pollution; Chapter I: Pollution Control Board; Subchapter C: Emission Standards and Limitations for Stationary Sources; Part 220: Nonmethane Organic Compounds of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC). Part 220 was adopted by the IPCB on June 17, 1998 and filed in the principal office on that day. Part 220 was published in the <E T="03">Illinois Register</E> on July 10, 1998 at 22 <E T="03">Ill. Reg.</E> 11790 and became effective on July 31, 1998. As part of the same rulemaking action, the IPCB amended 35 IAC Part 201: Permits and General Provisions; Subpart A: Definitions; Section 201.103 (a) by adding the following abbreviations: Mg = megagrams, M(3) = cubic meters, NMOC = nonmethane organic compounds, and yr = year. In Section 201.103 (b) the conversion factor for 1000 gal was changed from 3.785 cubic meters to 3.785 M(3). In Subpart C: Prohibitions, Section 201.146 was amended by adding paragraph (ggg) which states that municipal solid waste landfills with a maximum total design capacity of less than 2.5 million Mg or 2.5 million M(3) are not required to install a gas collection and control system pursuant to 35 Ill. Adm. Code 220 or 800 through 849 or Section 9.1 of the [Illinois Environmental Protection] Act. These amendments were published in the <E T="03">Illinois Register</E> on July 10, 1998 at 22 <E T="03">Ill. Reg.</E> 11824 and became effective on July 31, 1998.</P>

              <P>(a) This subpart contains emission requirements and compliance schedules for the control of pollutants from certain municipal waste combustors in accordance with section 111(d) and section 129 of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subparts B and Cb. This municipal waste combustor Federal plan applies to each affected facility as defined in § 62.14102 that is not covered by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan. This Federal plan, or portions thereof, also applies to each affected facility in any State whose approved State plan is subsequently vacated in whole or in part. This Federal plan, or portions thereof, also applies to each affected facility located in Indian country if the approved Tribal plan for that area is subsequently vacated in whole or in part.</P>

              <P>(b) The following authorities shall be retained by the EPA Administrator and not transferred to the State upon <PRTPAGE P="456"/>delegation of authority to the State to implement and enforce the Federal plan:</P>
              <P>(1) An alternative emission standard;</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 62.14109</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Reporting and recordkeeping and compliance and performance testing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The owner or operator of an affected facility must comply with the reporting and recordkeeping provisions listed in 40 CFR 60.59b of subpart Eb, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The siting requirements under 40 CFR 60.59b(a), (b)(5), and (d)(11) of subpart Eb and the notification of construction requirements under 40 CFR 60.59b(b) and (c) of subpart Eb do not apply.</P>
              <P>(2) 40 CFR 60.54b, 60.56b, and 60.58b(g)(5)(iii) of subpart Eb do not apply to this subpart (see §§ 62.14105 and 62.14107 of this subpart).</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator of an affected facility must comply with the compliance and performance testing methods and procedures listed in 40 CFR 60.58b of subpart Eb, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The initial performance test must be completed within 180 days after the date of final compliance specified in § 62.14108, rather than the date for the initial performance test specified in 40 CFR 60.58b of subpart Eb.</P>
              <P>(d) The owner or operator of an affected facility may follow the alternative performance testing schedule for dioxin/furan emissions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) If all performance tests for all affected facilities at the MWC plant over a 2-year period indicate that dioxin/<PRTPAGE P="463"/>furan emissions are less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter total mass, corrected to 7 percent oxygen for all affected facilities located within a municipal waste combustor plant, the owner or operator of the municipal waste combustor plant may elect to conduct annual performance tests for one affected facility (i.e., unit) per year at the municipal waste combustor plant. At a minimum, a performance test for dioxin/furan emissions shall be conducted annually (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) for one affected facility at the municipal waste combustor plant. Each year a different affected facility at the municipal waste combustor plant shall be tested, and the affected facilities at the plant shall be tested in sequence (e.g., unit 1, unit 2, unit 3, as applicable). If each annual performance test continues to indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), the owner or operator may continue conducting a performance test on only one affected facility per year. If any annual performance test indicates a dioxin/furan emission level greater than 15 nanograms per dry standrd cubic meter (total mass), performance tests thereafter shall be conducted annually on all affected facilities at the plant until and unless all annual performance tests for all affected facilities at the plant over a 2-year period indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass).</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator who is following the alternative performance testing schedule for dioxin/furan emissions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may choose an alternative testing sequence (e.g., unit 1, 3, 2, 4) for affected facilities at the municipal waste combustor plant. The owner or operator must submit a request to EPA for approval of the alternative testing sequence. After approval, the alternative testing sequence is effective until a different testing sequence is received and approved by EPA.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF final rule to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit notification to the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of completing each increment. Each notification must indicate which increment of progress specified in § 62.14108(a)(1) through (a)(5) has been achieved. The notification must be signed by the owner or operator of the affected facility.</P>
              <P>(f) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart who fails to meet any increment of progress specified in § 62.14108(a)(1) through (a)(5) according to the applicable schedule in § 62.14108 must submit notification to the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of the applicable date in § 62.14108 that the owner or operator failed to meet the increment.</P>
              <P>(g) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit a final control plan by the date specified in § 62.14108(b) with the notification required by § 62.14109(e). The final control plan must, at a minimum, include a description of the air pollution control devices or process changes that will be employed for each unit to comply with the emission limits and other requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(h) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit a signed copy of the contract or contracts awarded according to the requirements of § 62.14108(a)(2) with the notification required by § 62.14109(e).</P>

              <P>(i) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must keep on site a copy of the final control plan required by § 62.14109(g).<PRTPAGE P="464"/>
              </P>
              <P>(j) The owner or operator of an affected facility that plans to cease operation of the affected facility on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the applicable compliance date specified in § 62.14108 must submit a notification by the date specified for the final control plan according to the schedule specified in paragraphs § 62.14108(b)(1) through (b)(4), as applicable. (Affected facilities that cease operation on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the compliance date specified in § 62.14108 are not required to submit a final control plan.) The notification must state the date by which the affected facility will cease operation. If the cease operation date is later than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF, the owner or operator must enter into a legally binding closure agreement with EPA by the date the final control plan is due. The agreement must specify the date by which operation will cease.</P>
              <P>(k) The owner or operator of an affected facility that plans to de-rate the affected facility on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the compliance date specified in § 62.14108 must submit a final control plan as required by paragraph (g) of this section and submit notification of increments of progress as required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and § 62.14108(e) of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The final control plan must, at a minimum, include the information in paragraphs (k)(1)(i) and (k)(1)(ii) of this section rather than the information in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the physical changes that will be made to accomplish the de-rating.</P>
              <P>(ii) Calculations of the current maximum combustion capacity and the planned maximum combustion capacity after the de-rating. (See the procedures specified in 40 CFR 60.58b(j) of subpart Eb for calculating municipal waste combustor unit capacity.)</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator must submit a signed copy of the contract or contracts awarded to initiate the de-rating with the notification required by paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(l) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is ceasing operation more than 1 year following the date of publication of this subpart FFF must submit performance test results for dioxin/furan emissions conducted during or after 1990 for each affected facility by the date 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF. The performance test shall be conducted according to the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(m) The owner or operator (or the State air pollution control authority) that is submitting alternative dates for increments 2, 3, and 4 according to § 62.14108(b)(4) must submit the alternative dates by the date specified for the final control plan according to the schedule specified in paragraphs § 62.14108 (b)(1) and (b)(2), as applicable. The owner or operator (or the State air pollution control authority) must submit a justification if any of the alternative dates are later than the increment dates in tables 4 or 5 of this subpart. The owner or operator must also submit the alternative dates and justification to the State.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Designated facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The designated facility to which this subpart applies is each municipal solid waste landfill in all States, protectorates, and Indian Country that meets the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, except for landfills exempted by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The municipal solid waste landfill commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification before May 30, 1991 (landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991 are subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW), and</P>
              <P>(2) The municipal solid waste landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987 or the landfill has additional capacity for future waste deposition.</P>
              <P>(b) A municipal solid waste landfill regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is not subject to the requirements of this subpart. States that have an approved and effective State plan are listed in table 1 of this subpart. Notwithstanding the exclusions in table 1 of this subpart, any MSW landfill located in a State or portion of Indian country that does not have an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is subject to the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(c) A municipal solid waste landfill located in a State, locality, or portion of Indian country that submitted a negative declaration letter is not subject to the requirements of this subpart other than the requirements in the definition of design capacity to recalculate the site-specific density annually and in § 62.14355 to submit an amended design capacity report in the event that the recalculated design capacity is equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. However, if the existing municipal solid waste landfill already <PRTPAGE P="470"/>has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, then it is subject to the requirements of the Federal plan. States, localities, or portions of Indian country that submitted negative declaration letters are listed in table 2 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) Physical or operational changes made to an existing municipal solid waste landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing municipal solid waste landfill to the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW.</P>
              <P>(e) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2,000 and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter April 6, 2000, even if the initial design capacity report is submitted earlier. In addition, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2000, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, but whose design capacity subsequently increases to equal or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters by a change that is not a modification or reconstruction becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter upon the date the amended design capacity report is due.</P>
              <P>(f) When a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart is closed, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control system under § 62.14353 of this subpart; or</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator meets the conditions for control system removal specified in 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2)(v).</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I determine if my HMIWI is covered by an approved and effective State or Tribal plan?</SUBJECT>
                <P>This part (40 CFR part 62) contains a list of all states and tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d)/129 plans in effect. However, this part is only updated once a year. Thus, if this part does not indicate that your state or tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your state environmental agency's air director or your EPA Regional Office to determine if approval occurred since publication of the most recent version of this part. A state may also meet its CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its 111(d)/129 obligations.</P>
                <P>(a) An acceptable Federal plan delegation request must include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the Federal plan.</P>
                <P>(2) The items under §§ 60.25(a) and 60.39e(c).</P>
                <P>(3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.</P>
                <P>(4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in the EPA's Delegation Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)(2)/129(b)(3) Federal plans.</P>
                <P>(b) A state with an already approved HMIWI CAA section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the revised Federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of the EPA's previous state plan approval.</P>
                <P>(c) A state's CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under Title V of the CAA.</P>

                <P>(a) Your waste management plan must identify both the feasibility of, and the approach for, separating certain components of solid waste from the health care waste stream in order to reduce the amount of toxic emissions from incinerated waste. The waste management plan you develop may address, but is not limited to, elements such as segregation and recycling of paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, batteries, food waste and metals (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> aluminum cans, metals-containing devices); segregation of non-recyclable wastes (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> polychlorinated biphenyl-containing waste, pharmaceutical waste, and mercury-containing waste such as dental waste); and purchasing recycled or recyclable products. Your waste management plan may include different goals or approaches for different areas or departments of the facility and need not include new waste management goals for every waste stream. When you develop your waste management plan, it should identify, where possible, reasonably available additional waste management measures, taking into account the effectiveness of waste management measures already in place, the costs of additional measures, the emissions reductions expected to be achieved, and any other potential environmental or energy impacts they might have. In developing your waste management plan, you must consider the American Hospital Association (AHA) publication titled “Ounce of Prevention: Waste Reduction Strategies for Health Care Facilities.” This publication (AHA Catalog Number 057007) is available for purchase from AHA Services, Inc., Post Office Box 933283, Atlanta, Georgia 31193-3283.</P>
                <P>(b) If you own or operate commercial HMIWI, you must conduct training and education programs in waste segregation for each of your waste generator clients and ensure that each client prepares its own waste management plan that includes, but is not limited to, the provisions listed in this section.</P>
                <P>(c) If you own or operate commercial HMIWI, you must conduct training and education programs in waste segregation for your HMIWI operators.</P>

                <P>(a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, you must conduct an initial performance test for PM, opacity, CO, dioxin/furan, HCl, Pb, Cd, Hg, SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E> and fugitive ash emissions using the test methods and procedures outlined in § 62.14452.</P>
                <P>(b) After the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 62.14470, whichever date comes first, you must:</P>
                <P>(1) Determine compliance with the opacity limit by conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 62.14452.</P>
                <P>(2) Determine compliance with the PM, CO, and HCl emission limits by conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 62.14452. If all three performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), you may forego a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. At a minimum, you must conduct a performance test for PM, CO, and HCl every third year (no more than 36 months following the previous performance test). If a performance test conducted every third year indicates compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), you may forego a performance test for that pollutant for an additional 2 years. If any performance test indicates noncompliance with the respective emission limit, you must conduct a performance test for that pollutant annually until all annual performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the emission limit.</P>
                <P>(3) If you use a large HMIWI that commenced construction or modification according to § 62.14400(a)(2)(ii), determine compliance with the visible emissions limits for fugitive emissions from flyash/bottom ash storage and handling by conducting a performance test using EPA Reference Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 on an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test).</P>
                <P>(c) The 2,000 lb/wk limitation for small rural HMIWI does not apply during performance tests.</P>
                <P>(d) The EPA Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.</P>
                <P>(e) You may use the results of previous emissions tests to demonstrate compliance with the emissions limits, provided that the conditions in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section are met:</P>
                <P>(1) Your previous emissions tests must have been conducted using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 62.14452. Previous emissions test results obtained using the EPA-accepted voluntary consensus standards are also acceptable.</P>

                <P>(2) The HMIWI at your facility must currently be operated in a manner (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> with charge rate, secondary chamber temperature, etc.) that would be expected to result in the same or lower emissions than observed during the previous emissions test(s), and the HMIWI may not have been modified such that emissions would be expected to exceed the results from previous emissions test(s).</P>
                <P>(3) The previous emissions test(s) must have been conducted in 1996 or later.</P>

You may use ASTM D6784-02 (incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 60.17) as an alternative to EPA Reference Method 29 for measuring Hg emissions. <PRTPAGE P="482"/>You may also use Hg CEMS, as specified in paragraph (o) of this section, or a continuous automated sampling system for monitoring Hg emissions, as specified in paragraph (q) of this section, as an alternative to demonstrate compliance with the Hg emissions limit. You may use multi-metals CEMS, as specified in paragraph (o) of this section, as an alternative to EPA Reference Method 29 to demonstrate compliance with the Pb, Cd or Hg emissions limits;</P>
                <P>(n) You must use EPA Reference Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 to measure fugitive ash emissions and determine compliance with the fugitive ash emissions limit, as applicable, under § 60.52c(c). The minimum observation time must be a series of three 1-hour observations.</P>
                <P>(o) If you are using a CEMS to demonstrate compliance with any of the emissions limits under §§ 62.14411 or 62.14412, you:</P>

                <P>(a) If your HMIWI uses combustion control only, or your HMIWI is equipped with a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter (FF), a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a FF and wet scrubber, or a selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) system:</P>
                <P>(1) You must establish the appropriate maximum and minimum operating parameters, indicated in Table 3, as site-specific operating parameters during the initial performance test to determine compliance with the emission limits; and</P>
                <P>(2) After the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 62.14470, whichever comes first, your HMIWI must not operate above any of the applicable maximum operating parameters or below any of the applicable minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 and measured as 3-hour rolling averages (calculated each hour as the average of the previous 3 operating hours), at all times except during performance tests.</P>

                <P>(a) Except as provided in §§ 62.14452(o) through (q), you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the applicable maximum and minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 of this subpart (unless CEMS are used as a substitute for certain parameters as specified) such that these devices (or methods) measure and record values for the operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in Table 3 of this subpart at all times. For charge rate, the device must measure and record the date, time and weight of each charge fed to the HMIWI. This must be done automatically, meaning that the only intervention from an operator during the process would be to load the charge onto the weighing device. For batch HMIWI, the maximum charge rate is measured on a daily basis (the amount of waste charged to the unit each day).</P>
                <P>(b) For all HMIWI, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate a device or method for measuring the use of the bypass stack, including the date, time and duration of such use.</P>
                <P>(c) For all HMIWI, if you are using controls other than a dry scrubber followed by a FF, a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a FF and a wet scrubber, or a SNCR system to comply with the emissions limits under § 62.14411, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate the equipment necessary to monitor the site-specific operating parameters developed pursuant to § 62.14453(b).</P>
                <P>(d) You must obtain monitoring data at all times during HMIWI operation except during periods of monitoring equipment malfunction, calibration, or repair. At a minimum, valid monitoring data must be obtained for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter that your HMIWI is combusting hospital waste and/or medical/infectious waste.</P>

                <P>(e) If you use an air pollution control device that includes a FF and are not demonstrating compliance using PM CEMS, you must determine compliance with the PM emissions limit using a bag leak detection system and meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (12) of this section for each bag leak detection system.<PRTPAGE P="484"/>
                </P>

This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D-243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emissions Measurement Center Continuous Emissions Monitoring. Other types of bag leak detection systems must be installed, operated, calibrated and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.</P>
                <P>(2) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.</P>
                <P>(3) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide an output of relative PM loadings.</P>
                <P>(4) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.</P>
                <P>(5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an audible alarm system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative PM emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.</P>
                <P>(6) For positive pressure FF systems, a bag leak detector must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.</P>
                <P>(7) For negative pressure or induced air FF, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the FF.</P>
                <P>(8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</P>
                <P>(9) The baseline output must be established by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance.”</P>
                <P>(10) Following initial adjustment of the system, the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points or alarm delay time may not be adjusted. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete FF inspection that demonstrates that the FF is in good operating condition. Each adjustment must be recorded.</P>
                <P>(11) Record the results of each inspection, calibration and validation check.</P>
                <P>(12) Initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection system alarm; operate and maintain the FF such that the alarm is not engaged for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period. If inspection of the FF demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.</P>

Also, if you own or operate a unit described in § 62.14400(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5) or (b)(6), you are not subject to any requirements of this subpart; therefore, this subpart does not require you to obtain a title V permit.</P>

                <SUBJECT>When must I submit a title V permit application for my HMIWI?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You must submit a title V permit application in time for it to be determined or deemed complete by no later than September 15, 2000 or by the effective date of a title V permits program in the jurisdiction in which the unit is located, whichever is later. (An earlier deadline may apply if your HMIWI is also subject to title V permitting requirements because of some other triggering requirement.) A “complete” title V permit application is one that has been approved by the appropriate permitting authority as complete under Section 503 of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR parts 70 and 71. It is not enough to have submitted a title V permit application by September 15, 2000 because the application must be determined or deemed complete by the permitting authority by that date for your HMIWI to operate after that date in compliance with Federal law.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 62.14510</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Am I subject to this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a CISWI unit as defined in § 62.14840 and the CISWI unit meets the criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) Construction of your CISWI unit commenced on or before November 30, 1999.</P>
                <P>(2) Your CISWI unit is not exempt under § 62.14525.</P>
                <P>(3) Your CISWI unit is not regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan, or your CISWI unit is located in any State whose approved State or Tribal plan is subsequently vacated in whole or in part.</P>
                <P>(b) If you made changes after June 1, 2001 that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction after promulgation of the final 40 CFR part 60 subpart CCCC (New Source Performance Standards for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units), your CISWI unit is subject to subpart CCCC of 40 CFR part 60 and this subpart no longer applies to that unit.</P>
                <P>(c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing CISWI unit primarily to comply with this subpart, then such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under subpart CCCC of 40 CFR part 60.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Can my CISWI unit be covered by both a State plan and this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If your CISWI unit is located in a State that does not have an EPA-approved State plan or your State's plan has not become effective, this subpart applies to your CISWI unit until the EPA approves a State plan that covers your CISWI unit and that State plan becomes effective. However, a State may enforce the requirements of a State regulation while your CISWI unit is still subject to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) After the EPA approves a State plan covering your CISWI unit, and after that State plan becomes effective, you will no longer be subject to this subpart and will only be subject to the approved and effective State plan.</P>

                <P>This part (40 CFR part 62) contains a list of State and Tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act section 111(d) and section 129 plans along with the effective dates for such plans. The list is published annually. If this part does not indicate that your State or Tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your State environmental agency's air director or your EPA Regional Office to determine if the EPA has approved a State plan <PRTPAGE P="502"/>covering your unit since publication of the most recent version of this subpart.</P>

                <P>(a) This subpart applies to your small municipal waste combustion unit if the unit meets the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) and the criteria in either paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) Your municipal waste combustion unit has the capacity to combust at least 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel but no more than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.</P>
                <P>(2) Your municipal waste combustion unit commenced construction on or before August 30, 1999.</P>
                <P>(3) Your municipal waste combustion unit is not regulated by an EPA approved and effective State or Tribal plan.</P>

                <P>(4) Your municipal waste combustion unit is located in any State whose approved State plan is subsequently vacated in whole or in part, or the municipal waste combustion unit is located <PRTPAGE P="525"/>in Indian country if the approved tribal plan for that area is subsequently vacated in whole or in part.</P>
                <P>(b) If you make a change to your municipal waste combustion unit that meets the definition of modification or reconstruction after June 6, 2001, your municipal waste combustion unit becomes subject to subpart AAAA of 40 CFR part 60 (New Source Performance Standards for Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units) and this subpart no longer applies to your unit.</P>
                <P>(c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing municipal waste combustion unit primarily to comply with this subpart, then subpart AAAA of 40 CFR part 60 (New Source Performance Standards for Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units) does not apply to your unit. Such changes do not constitute modifications or reconstructions under subpart AAAA of 40 CFR part 60.</P>
                <P>(d) Upon approval of the State or tribal plan, this subpart will no longer apply, except for the provisions of this subpart that may have been incorporated by reference under the State or Tribal plan, or delegated to the State by the Administrator.</P>

                <P>If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor both are unavailable, a provisionally certified control room operator at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor is away, you must meet one of three criteria:</P>
                <P>(a) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are both offsite for 12 hours or less and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the periods when the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite and include this information in the annual report as specified under § 62.15340(l).</P>
                <P>(c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, you must take two actions:</P>
                <P>(1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.</P>
                <P>(2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may continue.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What minimum amount of monitoring data must I collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is this requirement enforceable?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level). Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen (or carbon dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level).</P>
                <P>(b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60 requires your continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute period.</P>

                <SUBJECT>May I conduct stack testing less often?</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission limit. In this case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every third year but no later than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years show compliance <PRTPAGE P="537"/>with the emission limit for that pollutant. This provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.</P>
                <P>(b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that are subject to this subpart. Second, all these municipal waste combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for 2 consecutive years. In this case, you may choose to conduct annual stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit per year at your plant. This provision only applies to stack testing for dioxins/furans emissions.</P>
                <P>(1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, you may continue stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year.</P>
                <P>(3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans emissions greater than 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, conduct subsequent annual stack tests on all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans emission levels less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for all municipal waste combustion units at your plant subject to this subpart for 2 consecutive years.</P>

                <P>(a) You are subject to this subpart if your SSI unit meets all three criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) that commenced construction on or before October 14, 2010.</P>
                <P>(2) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) that meet the definition of an SSI unit as defined in § 62.16045.</P>
                <P>(3) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) not exempt under § 62.15860.</P>
                <P>(b) If you own or operator an SSI unit(s) and make changes that meet the definition of modification after September 21, 2011, the SSI unit becomes subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL, and the federal plan no longer applies to that unit.</P>
                <P>(c) If you own or operate an SSI unit(s) and make physical or operational changes to the SSI unit(s) for which construction commenced on or before September 21, 2011 primarily to comply with the federal plan, 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL, does not apply to the unit(s). Such changes do not qualify as modifications under 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What SSI units are exempt from the federal plan?</SUBJECT>

                <P>This subpart exempts combustion units that incinerate sewage sludge and are not located at a wastewater treatment facility designed to treat domestic sewage sludge. These units may be subject to another subpart of this part (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> subpart III of this part). If you own or operate such a combustion unit, you must notify the Administrator of an exemption claim under this section.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 62.15865</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>How do I determine if my SSI unit is covered by an approved and effective state or tribal plan?</SUBJECT>
                <P>This part contains a list of all states and tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d)/129 plans in effect. However, this part is only updated once a year. Thus, if this part does not indicate that your state or tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your state environmental agency's air director or your EPA regional office to determine if approval occurred since publication of the most recent version of this part. A state may also meet its CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its 111(d)/129 obligations.</P>
                <P>(a) An acceptable federal plan delegation request must include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the federal plan.</P>
                <P>(2) The items under § 60.5015(a)(1), (2), and (7) of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.</P>
                <P>(4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in the EPA's “Delegations Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)(2)/129(b)(3) federal plans.”</P>
                <P>(b) A state with an already approved SSI CAA section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of the EPA's previous state plan approval.</P>
                <P>(c) A state's CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under title V of the CAA.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How and when do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards?</SUBJECT>
                <P>To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you have the option to demonstrate initial compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead and fugitive emissions from ash handling. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 62.16015(a) and (b). You may also petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(a) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a performance test. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (e) of this section, following the date that the initial performance test for each pollutant in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart is completed, you must conduct a performance test for each such pollutant on an annual basis (between 11 and 13 calendar months following the previous performance test). The performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring and calibration requirements specified in § 62.16015(a).</P>
                <P>(1) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits to apply from that point forward. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.</P>
                <P>(2) You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process change, as defined in § 62.16045.</P>
                <P>(3) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, you can conduct performance tests less often for a given pollutant, as specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>

                <P>(i) You can conduct performance tests less often if your performance tests for the pollutant for at least 2 consecutive years show that your emissions are at or below 75-percent of the emission limit specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, and there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions. In this case, you do not have to conduct a <PRTPAGE P="578"/>performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year and no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.</P>
                <P>(ii) If your SSI unit continues to meet the emission limit for the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year if your emissions are at or below 75-percent of the emission limit, and if there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions, but each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.</P>
                <P>(iii) If a performance test shows emissions exceeded 75-percent of the emission limit for a pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over 2 consecutive years show compliance.</P>

                <P>(b) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                  <E T="02">.</E> The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                  <E T="02">.</E> Collect data as specified in § 62.16015(b)(6) and use the following procedures:</P>
                <P>(1) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the annual performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in lieu of conducting the annual performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section. For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7-percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7-percent oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.</P>
                <P>(ii) You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the annual mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must use the continuous emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in § 62.16015(b). You must measure emissions according to § 60.13 of this chapter to calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7-percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide).
