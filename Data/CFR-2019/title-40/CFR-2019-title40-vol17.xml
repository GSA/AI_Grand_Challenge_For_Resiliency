      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

Equipment that must be operated at an efficiency higher than that achieved during normal process operations in order to comply with the applicable emission limitation or standard is not inherent process equipment. For the purposes of this part, inherent process equipment is not considered a control device.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Monitoring design criteria.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General criteria.</E> To provide a reasonable assurance of compliance with emission limitations or standards for the anticipated range of operations at a pollutant-specific emissions unit, monitoring under this part shall meet the following general criteria:</P>
            <P>(1) The owner or operator shall design the monitoring to obtain data for one or more indicators of emission control performance for the control device, any associated capture system and, if necessary to satisfy paragraph (a)(2) of this section, processes at a pollutant-specific emissions unit. Indicators of performance may include, but are not limited to, direct or predicted emissions (including visible emissions or opacity), process and control device parameters that affect control device (and capture system) efficiency or emission rates, or recorded findings of inspection and maintenance activities conducted by the owner or operator.</P>
            <P>(2) The owner or operator shall establish an appropriate range(s) or designated condition(s) for the selected indicator(s) such that operation within the ranges provides a reasonable assurance of ongoing compliance with emission limitations or standards for the anticipated range of operating conditions. Such range(s) or condition(s) shall reflect the proper operation and maintenance of the control device (and associated capture system), in accordance with applicable design properties, for minimizing emissions over the anticipated range of operating conditions at least to the level required to achieve compliance with the applicable requirements. The reasonable assurance of compliance will be assessed by maintaining performance within the indicator range(s) or designated condition(s). The ranges shall be established in accordance with the design and performance requirements in this section and documented in accordance with the requirements in § 64.4. If necessary to assure that the control device and associated capture system can satisfy this criterion, the owner or operator shall monitor appropriate process operational parameters (such as total throughput where necessary to stay within the rated capacity for a control device). In addition, unless specifically stated otherwise by an applicable requirement, the owner or operator shall monitor indicators to detect any bypass of the control device (or capture system) to the atmosphere, if such bypass can occur based on the design of the pollutant-specific emissions unit.</P>
            <P>(3) The design of indicator ranges or designated conditions may be:</P>

            <P>(i) Based on a single maximum or minimum value if appropriate (e.g., maintaining condenser temperatures a certain number of degrees below the condensation temperature of the applicable compound(s) being processed) or <PRTPAGE P="9"/>at multiple levels that are relevant to distinctly different operating conditions (e.g., high versus low load levels).</P>
            <P>(ii) Expressed as a function of process variables (e.g., an indicator range expressed as minimum to maximum pressure drop across a venturi throat in a particulate control scrubber).</P>
            <P>(iii) Expressed as maintaining the applicable parameter in a particular operational status or designated condition (e.g., position of a damper controlling gas flow to the atmosphere through a by-pass duct).</P>
            <P>(iv) Established as interdependent between more than one indicator.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Performance criteria.</E> The owner or operator shall design the monitoring to meet the following performance criteria:</P>
            <P>(1) Specifications that provide for obtaining data that are representative of the emissions or parameters being monitored (such as detector location and installation specifications, if applicable).</P>
            <P>(2) For new or modified monitoring equipment, verification procedures to confirm the operational status of the monitoring prior to the date by which the owner or operator must conduct monitoring under this part as specified in § 64.7(a). The owner or operator shall consider the monitoring equipment manufacturer's requirements or recommendations for installation, calibration, and start-up operation.</P>
            <P>(3) Quality assurance and control practices that are adequate to ensure the continuing validity of the data. The owner or operator shall consider manufacturer recommendations or requirements applicable to the monitoring in developing appropriate quality assurance and control practices.</P>
            <P>(4) Specifications for the frequency of conducting the monitoring, the data collection procedures that will be used (e.g., computerized data acquisition and handling, alarm sensor, or manual log entries based on gauge readings), and, if applicable, the period over which discrete data points will be averaged for the purpose of determining whether an excursion or exceedance has occurred.</P>
            <P>(i) At a minimum, the owner or operator shall design the period over which data are obtained and, if applicable, averaged consistent with the characteristics and typical variability of the pollutant-specific emissions unit (including the control device and associated capture system). Such intervals shall be commensurate with the time period over which a change in control device performance that would require actions by owner or operator to return operations within normal ranges or designated conditions is likely to be observed.</P>

            <P>(ii) For all pollutant-specific emissions units with the potential to emit, calculated <E T="03">including</E> the effect of control devices, the applicable regulated air pollutant in an amount equal to or greater than 100 percent of the amount, in tons per year, required for a source to be classified as a major source, for each parameter monitored, the owner or operator shall collect four or more data values equally spaced over each hour and average the values, as applicable, over the applicable averaging period as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. The permitting authority may approve a reduced data collection frequency, if appropriate, based on information presented by the owner or operator concerning the data collection mechanisms available for a particular parameter for the particular pollutant-specific emissions unit (e.g., integrated raw material or fuel analysis data, noninstrumental measurement of waste feed rate or visible emissions, use of a portable analyzer or an alarm sensor).</P>
            <P>(iii) For other pollutant-specific emissions units, the frequency of data collection may be less than the frequency specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section but the monitoring shall include some data collection at least once per 24-hour period (e.g., a daily inspection of a carbon adsorber operation in conjunction with a weekly or monthly check of emissions with a portable analyzer).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluation factors.</E> In designing monitoring to meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the owner or operator shall take into account site-specific factors including the applicability of existing monitoring equipment and procedures, <PRTPAGE P="10"/>the ability of the monitoring to account for process and control device operational variability, the reliability and latitude built into the control technology, and the level of actual emissions relative to the compliance limitation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Special criteria for the use of continuous emission, opacity or predictive monitoring systems.</E> (1) If a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS), continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) or predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) is required pursuant to other authority under the Act or state or local law, the owner or operator shall use such system to satisfy the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) The use of a CEMS, COMS, or PEMS that satisfies any of the following monitoring requirements shall be deemed to satisfy the general design criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, provided that a COMS may be subject to the criteria for establishing indicator ranges under paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) Section 51.214 and appendix P of part 51 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(ii) Section 60.13 and appendix B of part 60 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(iii) Section 63.8 and any applicable performance specifications required pursuant to the applicable subpart of part 63 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(iv) Part 75 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(v) Subpart H and appendix IX of part 266 of this chapter; or</P>
            <P>(vi) If an applicable requirement does not otherwise require compliance with the requirements listed in the preceding paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, comparable requirements and specifications established by the permitting authority.</P>
            <P>(3) The owner or operator shall design the monitoring system subject to this paragraph (d) to:</P>
            <P>(i) Allow for reporting of exceedances (or excursions if applicable to a COMS used to assure compliance with a particulate matter standard), consistent with any period for reporting of exceedances in an underlying requirement. If an underlying requirement does not contain a provision for establishing an averaging period for the reporting of exceedances or excursions, the criteria used to develop an averaging period in (b)(4) of this section shall apply; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide an indicator range consistent with paragraph (a) of this section for a COMS used to assure compliance with a particulate matter standard. If an opacity standard applies to the pollutant-specific emissions unit, such limit may be used as the appropriate indicator range unless the opacity limit fails to meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section after considering the type of control device and other site-specific factors applicable to the pollutant-specific emissions unit.</P>

            <P>(b) As part of the information submitted, the owner or operator shall submit a justification for the proposed elements of the monitoring. If the performance specifications proposed to satisfy § 64.3(b)(2) or (3) include differences from manufacturer recommendations, the owner or operator shall explain the reasons for the differences between the requirements proposed by the owner or operator and the manufacturer's recommendations or requirements. The owner or operator also shall submit any data supporting the justification, and may refer to generally available sources of information used to support the justification (such as generally available air pollution engineering manuals, or EPA or permitting authority publications on appropriate monitoring for various types of control devices or capture systems). To justify the appropriateness of the monitoring elements proposed, the owner <PRTPAGE P="11"/>or operator may rely in part on existing applicable requirements that establish the monitoring for the applicable pollutant-specific emissions unit or a similar unit. If an owner or operator relies on presumptively acceptable monitoring, no further justification for the appropriateness of that monitoring should be necessary other than an explanation of the applicability of such monitoring to the unit in question, unless data or information is brought forward to rebut the assumption. Presumptively acceptable monitoring includes:</P>
            <P>(1) Presumptively acceptable or required monitoring approaches, established by the permitting authority in a rule that constitutes part of the applicable implementation plan required pursuant to title I of the Act, that are designed to achieve compliance with this part for particular pollutant-specific emissions units;</P>
            <P>(2) Continuous emission, opacity or predictive emission monitoring systems that satisfy applicable monitoring requirements and performance specifications as specified in § 64.3(d);</P>
            <P>(3) Excepted or alternative monitoring methods allowed or approved pursuant to part 75 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(4) Monitoring included for standards exempt from this part pursuant to § 64.2(b)(1)(i) or (vi) to the extent such monitoring is applicable to the performance of the control device (and associated capture system) for the pollutant-specific emissions unit; and</P>
            <P>(5) Presumptively acceptable monitoring identified in guidance by EPA. Such guidance will address the requirements under §§ 64.4(a), (b), and (c) to the extent practicable.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit control device (and process and capture system, if applicable) operating parameter data obtained during the conduct of the applicable compliance or performance test conducted under conditions specified by the applicable rule. If the applicable rule does not specify testing conditions or only partially specifies test conditions, the performance test generally shall be conducted under conditions representative of maximum emissions potential under anticipated operating conditions at the pollutant-specific emissions unit. Such data may be supplemented, if desired, by engineering assessments and manufacturer's recommendations to justify the indicator ranges (or, if applicable, the procedures for establishing such indicator ranges). Emission testing is not required to be conducted over the entire indicator range or range of potential emissions.</P>
            <P>(2) The owner or operator must document that no changes to the pollutant-specific emissions unit, including the control device and capture system, have taken place that could result in a significant change in the control system performance or the selected ranges or designated conditions for the indicators to be monitored since the performance or compliance tests were conducted.</P>
            <P>(d) If existing data from unit-specific compliance or performance testing specified in paragraph (c) of this section are not available, the owner or operator:</P>
            <P>(1) Shall submit a test plan and schedule for obtaining such data in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(2) May submit indicator ranges (or procedures for establishing indicator ranges) that rely on engineering assessments and other data, provided that the owner or operator demonstrates that factors specific to the type of monitoring, control device, or pollutant-specific emissions unit make compliance or performance testing unnecessary to establish indicator ranges at levels that satisfy the criteria in § 64.3(a).</P>

            <P>(e) If the monitoring submitted by the owner or operator requires installation, testing, or other necessary activities prior to use of the monitoring for purposes of this part, the owner or operator shall include an implementation plan and schedule for installing, testing and performing any other appropriate activities prior to use of the monitoring. The implementation plan and schedule shall provide for use of the monitoring as expeditiously as practicable after approval of the monitoring in the part 70 or 71 permit pursuant to § 64.6, but in no case shall the schedule for completing installation <PRTPAGE P="12"/>and beginning operation of the monitoring exceed 180 days after approval of the permit.</P>
            <P>(f) If a control device is common to more than one pollutant-specific emissions unit, the owner or operator may submit monitoring for the control device and identify the pollutant-specific emissions units affected and any process or associated capture device conditions that must be maintained or monitored in accordance with § 64.3(a) rather than submit separate monitoring for each pollutant-specific emissions unit.</P>
            <P>(g) If a single pollutant-specific emissions unit is controlled by more than one control device similar in design and operation, the owner or operator may submit monitoring that applies to all the control devices and identify the control devices affected and any process or associated capture device conditions that must be maintained or monitored in accordance with § 64.3(a) rather than submit a separate description of monitoring for each control device.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Large pollutant-specific emissions units.</E> For all pollutant-specific emissions units with the potential to emit (taking into account control devices to the extent appropriate under the definition of this term in § 64.1) the applicable regulated air pollutant in an amount equal to or greater than 100 percent of the amount, in tons per year, required for a source to be classified as a major source, the owner or operator shall submit the information required under § 64.4 at the following times:</P>
            <P>(1) On or after April 20, 1998, the owner or operator shall submit information as part of an application for an initial part 70 or 71 permit if, by that date, the application either:</P>
            <P>(i) Has not been filed; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Has not yet been determined to be complete by the permitting authority.</P>
            <P>(2) On or after April 20, 1998, the owner or operator shall submit information as part of an application for a significant permit revision under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, but only with respect to those pollutant-specific emissions units for which the proposed permit revision is applicable.</P>
            <P>(3) The owner or operator shall submit any information not submitted under the deadlines set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section as part of the application for the renewal of a part 70 or 71 permit.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Other pollutant-specific emissions units.</E> For all other pollutant-specific emissions units subject to this part and not subject to § 64.5(a), the owner or operator shall submit the information required under § 64.4 as part of an application for a renewal of a part 70 or 71 permit.</P>
            <P>(c) The effective date for the requirement to submit information under § 64.4 shall be as specified pursuant to paragraphs (a)-(b) of this section and a permit reopening to require the submittal of information under this section shall not be required pursuant to § 70.7(f)(1)(i) of this chapter, provided, however, that, if a part 70 or 71 permit is reopened for cause by EPA or the permitting authority pursuant to § 70.7(f)(1)(iii) or (iv), or § 71.7(f) or (g), the applicable agency may require the submittal of information under this section for those pollutant-specific emissions units that are subject to this part and that are affected by the permit reopening.</P>
            <P>(d) Prior to approval of monitoring that satisfies this part, the owner or operator is subject to the requirements of § 70.6(a)(3)(i)(B).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 64.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Approval of monitoring.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Based on an application that includes the information submitted in accordance with § 64.5, the permitting authority shall act to approve the monitoring submitted by the owner or operator by confirming that the monitoring satisfies the requirements in § 64.3.</P>

            <P>(b) In approving monitoring under this section, the permitting authority may condition the approval on the owner or operator collecting additional data on the indicators to be monitored for a pollutant-specific emissions unit, including required compliance or performance testing, to confirm the ability of the monitoring to provide data that are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this part and to confirm the appropriateness of an indicator <PRTPAGE P="13"/>range(s) or designated condition(s) proposed to satisfy § 64.3(a)(2) and (3) and consistent with the schedule in § 64.4(e).</P>
            <P>(c) If the permitting authority approves the proposed monitoring, the permitting authority shall establish one or more permit terms or conditions that specify the required monitoring in accordance with § 70.6(a)(3)(i) of this chapter. At a minimum, the permit shall specify:</P>
            <P>(1) The approved monitoring approach that includes all of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The indicator(s) to be monitored (such as temperature, pressure drop, emissions, or similar parameter);</P>
            <P>(ii) The means or device to be used to measure the indicator(s) (such as temperature measurement device, visual observation, or CEMS); and</P>
            <P>(iii) The performance requirements established to satisfy § 64.3(b) or (d), as applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) The means by which the owner or operator will define an exceedance or excursion for purposes of responding to and reporting exceedances or excursions under §§ 64.7 and 64.8 of this part. The permit shall specify the level at which an excursion or exceedance will be deemed to occur, including the appropriate averaging period associated with such exceedance or excursion. For defining an excursion from an indicator range or designated condition, the permit may either include the specific value(s) or condition(s) at which an excursion shall occur, or the specific procedures that will be used to establish that value or condition. If the latter, the permit shall specify appropriate notice procedures for the owner or operator to notify the permitting authority upon any establishment or reestablishment of the value.</P>
            <P>(3) The obligation to conduct the monitoring and fulfill the other obligations specified in §§ 64.7 through 64.9 of this part.</P>
            <P>(4) If appropriate, a minimum data availability requirement for valid data collection for each averaging period, and, if appropriate, a minimum data availability requirement for the averaging periods in a reporting period.</P>
            <P>(d) If the monitoring proposed by the owner or operator requires installation, testing or final verification of operational status, the part 70 or 71 permit shall include an enforceable schedule with appropriate milestones for completing such installation, testing, or final verification consistent with the requirements in § 64.4(e).</P>
            <P>(e) If the permitting authority disapproves the proposed monitoring, the following applies:</P>
            <P>(1) The draft or final permit shall include, at a minimum, monitoring that satisfies the requirements of § 70.6(a)(3)(i)(B);</P>
            <P>(2) The permitting authority shall include in the draft or final permit a compliance schedule for the source owner to submit monitoring that satisfies §§ 64.3 and 64.4, but in no case shall the owner or operator submit revised monitoring more than 180 days from the date of issuance of the draft or final permit; and</P>
            <P>(3) If the source owner or operator does not submit the monitoring in accordance with the compliance schedule as required in paragraph (e)(2) of this section or if the permitting authority disapproves the monitoring submitted, the source owner or operator shall be deemed not in compliance with part 64, unless the source owner or operator successfully challenges the disapproval.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Operation of approved monitoring.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Commencement of operation.</E> The owner or operator shall conduct the monitoring required under this part upon issuance of a part 70 or 71 permit that includes such monitoring, or by such later date specified in the permit pursuant to § 64.6(d).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Proper maintenance.</E> At all times, the owner or operator shall maintain the monitoring, including but not limited to, maintaining necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Continued operation.</E> Except for, as applicable, monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), the owner or operator shall conduct all monitoring in continuous operation (or shall collect data at all required intervals) at all times that <PRTPAGE P="14"/>the pollutant-specific emissions unit is operating. Data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities shall not be used for purposes of this part, including data averages and calculations, or fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement, if applicable. The owner or operator shall use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Response to excursions or exceedances.</E> (1) Upon detecting an excursion or exceedance, the owner or operator shall restore operation of the pollutant-specific emissions unit (including the control device and associated capture system) to its normal or usual manner of operation as expeditiously as practicable in accordance with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The response shall include minimizing the period of any startup, shutdown or malfunction and taking any necessary corrective actions to restore normal operation and prevent the likely recurrence of the cause of an excursion or exceedance (other than those caused by excused startup or shutdown conditions). Such actions may include initial inspection and evaluation, recording that operations returned to normal without operator action (such as through response by a computerized distribution control system), or any necessary follow-up actions to return operation to within the indicator range, designated condition, or below the applicable emission limitation or standard, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) Determination of whether the owner or operator has used acceptable procedures in response to an excursion or exceedance will be based on information available, which may include but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures and records, and inspection of the control device, associated capture system, and the process.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Documentation of need for improved monitoring.</E> After approval of monitoring under this part, if the owner or operator identifies a failure to achieve compliance with an emission limitation or standard for which the approved monitoring did not provide an indication of an excursion or exceedance while providing valid data, or the results of compliance or performance testing document a need to modify the existing indicator ranges or designated conditions, the owner or operator shall promptly notify the permitting authority and, if necessary, submit a proposed modification to the part 70 or 71 permit to address the necessary monitoring changes. Such a modification may include, but is not limited to, reestablishing indicator ranges or designated conditions, modifying the frequency of conducting monitoring and collecting data, or the monitoring of additional parameters.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Quality improvement plan (QIP) requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Based on the results of a determination made under § 64.7(d)(2), the Administrator or the permitting authority may require the owner or operator to develop and implement a QIP. Consistent with § 64.6(c)(3), the part 70 or 71 permit may specify an appropriate threshold, such as an accumulation of exceedances or excursions exceeding 5 percent duration of a pollutant-specific emissions unit's operating time for a reporting period, for requiring the implementation of a QIP. The threshold may be set at a higher or lower percent or may rely on other criteria for purposes of indicating whether a pollutant-specific emissions unit is being maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices.</P>
            <P>(b) Elements of a QIP:</P>
            <P>(1) The owner or operator shall maintain a written QIP, if required, and have it available for inspection.</P>

            <P>(2) The plan initially shall include procedures for evaluating the control performance problems and, based on the results of the evaluation procedures, the owner or operator shall modify the plan to include procedures for <PRTPAGE P="15"/>conducting one or more of the following actions, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(i) Improved preventive maintenance practices.</P>
            <P>(ii) Process operation changes.</P>
            <P>(iii) Appropriate improvements to control methods.</P>
            <P>(iv) Other steps appropriate to correct control performance.</P>
            <P>(v) More frequent or improved monitoring (only in conjunction with one or more steps under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section).</P>
            <P>(c) If a QIP is required, the owner or operator shall develop and implement a QIP as expeditiously as practicable and shall notify the permitting authority if the period for completing the improvements contained in the QIP exceeds 180 days from the date on which the need to implement the QIP was determined.</P>
            <P>(d) Following implementation of a QIP, upon any subsequent determination pursuant to § 64.7(d)(2) the Administrator or the permitting authority may require that an owner or operator make reasonable changes to the QIP if the QIP is found to have:</P>
            <P>(1) Failed to address the cause of the control device performance problems; or</P>
            <P>(2) Failed to provide adequate procedures for correcting control device performance problems as expeditiously as practicable in accordance with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.</P>
            <P>(e) Implementation of a QIP shall not excuse the owner or operator of a source from compliance with any existing emission limitation or standard, or any existing monitoring, testing, reporting or recordkeeping requirement that may apply under federal, state, or local law, or any other applicable requirements under the Act.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General reporting requirements.</E> (1) On and after the date specified in § 64.7(a) by which the owner or operator must use monitoring that meets the requirements of this part, the owner or operator shall submit monitoring reports to the permitting authority in accordance with § 70.6(a)(3)(iii) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(2) A report for monitoring under this part shall include, at a minimum, the information required under § 70.6(a)(3)(iii) of this chapter and the following information, as applicable:</P>
            <P>(i) Summary information on the number, duration and cause (including unknown cause, if applicable) of excursions or exceedances, as applicable, and the corrective actions taken;</P>
            <P>(ii) Summary information on the number, duration and cause (including unknown cause, if applicable) for monitor downtime incidents (other than downtime associated with zero and span or other daily calibration checks, if applicable); and</P>
            <P>(iii) A description of the actions taken to implement a QIP during the reporting period as specified in § 64.8. Upon completion of a QIP, the owner or operator shall include in the next summary report documentation that the implementation of the plan has been completed and reduced the likelihood of similar levels of excursions or exceedances occurring.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General recordkeeping requirements.</E> (1) The owner or operator shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 70.6(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter. The owner or operator shall maintain records of monitoring data, monitor performance data, corrective actions taken, any written quality improvement plan required pursuant to § 64.8 and any activities undertaken to implement a quality improvement plan, and other supporting information required to be maintained under this part (such as data used to document the adequacy of monitoring, or records of monitoring maintenance or corrective actions).</P>
            <P>(2) Instead of paper records, the owner or operator may maintain records on alternative media, such as microfilm, computer files, magnetic tape disks, or microfiche, provided that the use of such alternative media allows for expeditious inspection and review, and does not conflict with other applicable recordkeeping requirements.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Batch process</E> means a process in which the equipment is fed intermittently or discontinuously. Processing then occurs in this equipment after which the equipment is generally emptied. Examples of industries that use batch processes include pharmaceutical production and pesticide production.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Batch product-process equipment train</E> means the collection of equipment (for example, connectors, reactors, valves, pumps) configured to produce a specific product or intermediate by a batch process.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Boiler</E> means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator or a process heater. Boiler also means any industrial furnace as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Bottoms receiver</E> means a tank that collects distillation bottoms before the stream is sent for storage or for further downstream processing.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">By compound</E> means by individual stream components, not carbon equivalents.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Car-seal</E> means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to change the position of a valve (for example, from opened to closed) in such a way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Closed vent system</E> means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to a control device. A closed vent system does not include the vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck or railcar or the loading arm or hose that is used for vapor return. For transfer racks, the closed vent system begins at, and includes, the first block valve on the downstream side of the loading arm or hose used to convey displaced vapors.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance with standards and operation and maintenance requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the emission standards and established parameter ranges of this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown (as defined in § 65.2), malfunction, or nonoperation of the regulated source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this part applies. However, if a startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of nonoperation of one portion of a regulated source does not affect the ability of a particular emission point to comply with the specific provisions to which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the applicable provisions of this part during the startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of nonoperation. For example, if there is an over pressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel in a chemical manufacturing process unit would still be required to be controlled in accordance with subpart C of this part. Similarly, the degassing of a storage vessel would not affect the ability of a process vent to meet the requirements of subpart D or G of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Sections 65.106 through 65.118 shall apply at all times except during periods of startup or shutdown (as defined in § 65.2), malfunction, process unit shutdown (as defined in § 65.2), or nonoperation of the regulated source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which subpart F of this part applies.</P>
              <P>(3) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission standards of this part do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize emissions in excess of those that would have occurred if there were no startup, shutdown, or malfunction and the owner or operator complied with the relevant provisions of this part. The measures to be taken may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the regulated source. Backup control devices are not required but may be used if available. This paragraph (a)(3) does not apply to Group 2A or Group 2B process vents.</P>
              <P>(4) Malfunctions shall be corrected as soon as practical after their occurrence. This paragraph (a)(4) does not apply to Group 2A or Group 2B process vents.</P>
              <P>(5) Operation and maintenance requirements established pursuant to section 112 of the Act are enforceable independent of emissions limitations or other requirements in relevant standards.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance determination procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Parameter monitoring: Compliance with operating conditions.</E> The parameter monitoring data for emission points that are required to perform continuous monitoring shall be used to determine compliance with the required operating conditions for the monitored control devices or recovery devices. For each excursion, except for excused excursions and as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have failed to have applied the control in a manner that achieves the required operating conditions. Excused excursions are provided for in § 65.156(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Parameter monitoring: Excursions.</E> If the conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section are met, an excursion is not a violation and, in cases where continuous monitoring is required, the excursion does not count toward the number of excused excursions. Nothing in this paragraph (b)(2) shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of this part.</P>
              <P>(i) During periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction (and the source is operated during such periods in accordance with § 65.3(a)(3)), a monitoring parameter is outside its established range or monitoring data cannot be collected; or</P>

              <P>(ii) During periods of nonoperation of the regulated source or portion thereof (resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies).<PRTPAGE P="30"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Operation and maintenance procedures.</E> Determination of whether acceptable operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if applicable, required in § 65.6(a), as applicable), review of operation and maintenance records, inspection of the regulated source, and alternatives approved as specified in § 65.7.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Emissions standards.</E> Paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section shall govern the use of data, tests, and requirements to determine compliance with emissions standards. Paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) do not apply to Group 2A or Group 2B process vents. Compliance with design, equipment, work practice, and operational standards, including those for equipment leaks, shall be determined according to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Performance test.</E> The Administrator will determine compliance with emission standards of this part based on the results of performance tests conducted according to the procedures specified in subpart G of this part, unless otherwise specified in a subpart of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Operation and maintenance requirements.</E> The Administrator will determine compliance with emission standards of this part by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements, including the evaluation of monitoring data, as specified in subparts of this part.</P>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Operation and maintenance.</E> The Administrator will determine compliance with design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards by evaluation of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and maintenance requirements as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, in other subparts of this part, and in applicable provisions of § 65.6(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Finding of compliance.</E> The Administrator will make a finding concerning a regulated source's compliance with an emission standard, design standard, work practice, operational standard or operating and maintenance requirement as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section upon obtaining all the compliance information required by the relevant standard (including the written reports of performance test results, monitoring results, and other information, if applicable) and any information available to the Administrator needed to determine whether proper operation and maintenance practices are being used. Standards in this part and methods of determining compliance are given in metric units followed by the equivalents in English units. The Administrator will make findings of compliance with the standards of this part using metric units.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Compliance times.</E> All terms that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (for example, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually) unless specified otherwise in the section or paragraph that imposes the requirement refer to the standard calendar periods.</P>
              <P>(1) Notwithstanding time periods specified for completion of required tasks, time periods may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator as specified in § 65.5(h)(3) (for example, a period could begin on the compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the standard calendar period). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period applies until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.</P>

              <P>(2) When the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in the following paragraphs, as appropriate:<PRTPAGE P="31"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.</P>
              <P>(3) In all instances where a provision requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the specified period provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.</P>

The owner or operator using this option need not obtain prior approval, but must assure no reporting gaps from the last periodic report for the relevant standards. The owner or operator shall clearly identify the change in reporting schedule in the first report filed under paragraph (h) of this section. The requirements of paragraph (e) of this section are not waived when implementing this change.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Request for adjustment.</E> An owner or operator may arrange by mutual agreement (which may be a standing agreement) with the Administrator a common schedule on which periodic reports required by this part shall be submitted throughout the year as long as the reporting period is not extended. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practical before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted. A request for a change to the periodic reporting schedule need only be made once for every schedule change and not once for every semiannual report submitted.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Approval of request for adjustment.</E> If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline is warranted, the <PRTPAGE P="34"/>Administrator will approve the adjustment.

              <SUBJECT>Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan and procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to Group 2A or Group 2B process vents.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan</E>—(1) <E T="03">Description and purpose of plan.</E> The owner or operator of a regulated source shall develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that describes, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the regulated source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction and a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment used to comply with the relevant standard. The plan shall also address routine or otherwise predictable CPMS malfunctions. This plan shall be developed by the owner or operator by the regulated source's implementation date as specified in § 65.1(f), or for sources referenced from 40 CFR part 63, subpart F, by the compliance date specified in that subpart. The requirement to develop this plan shall be incorporated into the source's title V permit. This requirement is optional for equipment that must comply with subpart F of this part. It is not optional for equipment equipped with a closed vent system and control device subject to subpart G of this part. The purposes of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan are described in the following:</P>
              <P>(i) To ensure that owners or operators are prepared to correct malfunctions as soon as practical after their occurrence in order to minimize excess emissions of regulated material (excess emissions are defined in § 65.3(a)(4)); and</P>
              <P>(ii) To reduce the reporting burden associated with periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (including corrective action taken to restore malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment to its normal or usual manner of operation).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Operation of source.</E> During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator of a regulated source shall operate and maintain such source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) in accordance with § 65.3(a). The general duty to minimize emissions during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction does not require the owner or operator to achieve emission levels that would be required by the applicable standard at other times if this is not consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices, nor does it require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable <PRTPAGE P="35"/>standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures (including the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of additional procedures.</E> To satisfy the requirements of this section to develop a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator may use the regulated source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual, or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other plan, provided the alternative plans meet all the requirements of this section and are made available for inspection when requested by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Revisions to the plan.</E> Based on the results of a determination made under § 65.3(b)(3), the Administrator may require that an owner or operator of a regulated source make changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan for that source. The Administrator may require reasonable revisions to a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, if the Administrator finds that the plan is inadequate as specified in the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Does not address a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event of the CPMS, the air pollution control equipment, or the regulated source that has occurred; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Fails to provide for the operation of the regulated source (including associated air pollution control equipment and CPMS) during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction event in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions to the extent practical; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Does not provide adequate procedures for correcting malfunctioning process and/or air pollution control equipment as quickly as practicable; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Does not provide adequate measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions to the extent practical as specified and defined in § 65.3(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional malfunction plan requirements.</E> If the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan fails to address or inadequately addresses an event that meets the characteristics of a malfunction but was not included in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan at the time the owner or operator developed the plan, the owner or operator shall revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan within 45 days after the event to include detailed procedures for operating and maintaining the regulated source during similar malfunction events, and a program of corrective action for similar malfunctions of process or air pollution control equipment or CPMS.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Retain plan on site.</E> The current plan must be kept on site at all times.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Periodic startup, shutdown, and malfunction reports.</E> During the reporting period, reports shall only be required for startup, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions as defined in § 65.3(a)(4) occur. A startup, shutdown, and malfunction report can be submitted as part of a periodic report required under § 65.5(e), or on a more frequent basis if specified otherwise in a relevant standard or as established otherwise by the permitting authority in the source's title V permit. The startup, shutdown, and malfunction report shall be delivered or postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar half (or other calendar reporting period, as appropriate), unless the information is submitted with the periodic report. The report shall include the following information, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(1) The name, title, and signature of the owner or operator or other responsible official certifying its accuracy.</P>
              <P>(2) The number of startup, shutdown, malfunction events and the total duration of all periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction for the reporting period.</P>

              <P>(3) If actions taken by an owner or operator during a startup, shutdown, and malfunction of a regulated source, or of a control device or monitoring system required for compliance (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) are consistent with the procedures specified in the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, <PRTPAGE P="36"/>then the owner or operator shall state such information in a startup, shutdown, and malfunction report, and describe the actions taken. Such description can take the form of a checklist; only one checklist is necessary if actions taken are the same for multiple events during the reporting period.</P>
              <P>(4) If at any time an action taken by an owner or operator, during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction (including actions taken to correct a malfunction) during which excess emissions occur, as defined in § 65.3(a)(4), is not consistent with the procedures specified in the regulated source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, the owner or operator shall report the actions taken for that event as part of the periodic report. The report shall explain the circumstances of the event, the reasons for not following the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and whether any excess emissions and/or parameter monitoring exceedances are believed to have occurred.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting waivers and alternatives, and alternative work practice for equipment leaks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Waiver application.</E> The owner or operator may apply for a waiver from recordkeeping or reporting requirements if the regulated source is achieving the relevant standard(s), or the source is operating under an extension of compliance under 40 CFR 63.6(i), or a waiver of compliance under 40 CFR 61.10(b), or the owner or operator has requested an extension or waiver of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request. The waiver application shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Extension of compliance request.</E> If an application for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is made, the application shall accompany the request for an extension of compliance under 40 CFR 63.6(i) or the request for a waiver of compliance under 40 CFR 61.10(b), any required compliance progress report or compliance status report required in the source's title V permit application or a permit modification application, or a periodic report required under this part, whichever is applicable. The application shall include whatever information the owner or operator considers useful to convince the Administrator that a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting is warranted.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Approval or denial of waiver.</E> The Administrator will approve or deny a request for a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements when performing one of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(i) Approves or denies an extension of compliance under 40 CFR 63.6(i) or a waiver of compliance under 40 CFR 61.10(b); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Makes a determination of compliance following the submission of a required compliance status report or periodic report; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Makes a determination of suitable progress toward compliance following the submission of a compliance progress report, whichever is applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Waiver conditions.</E> A waiver of any recordkeeping or reporting requirement granted under this paragraph (a) may be conditioned on other recordkeeping or reporting requirements deemed necessary by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Waiver cancellation.</E> Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the regulated source.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests for approval of alternative monitoring or recordkeeping.</E> An owner or operator may submit a written request for approval to use alternatives to the monitoring or recordkeeping provisions of this part. For process vents and transfer racks, except low-throughput transfer racks, the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section shall govern the review and approval of requests. In addition, the application shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for an alternative monitoring or recordkeeping method, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the regulated source using the required method. For storage <PRTPAGE P="37"/>vessels and low throughput transfer racks, owners and operators shall comply with the requirements of § 65.145(b) for preparing and submitting a design evaluation. For equipment leaks, owners and operators shall comply with the recordkeeping requirements of § 65.163(d). Owners and operators are also provided the option of complying with an alternative work practice for monitoring leaking equipment in § 65.7 (e), (f), and (g) rather than monitoring equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval or denial of request to use alternative monitoring or recordkeeping.</E> The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of the request to use an alternative monitoring or recordkeeping method within 90 calendar days after receipt of the original request and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. Before disapproving any request to use an alternative method, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to disapprove the request together with the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended disapproval is based; and</P>
              <P>(2) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional information to the Administrator before final action on the request. At the time the Administrator notifies the applicant of the intention to disapprove the request, the Administrator will specify how much time the owner or operator will have after being notified of the intended disapproval to submit the additional information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of an alternative monitoring or recordkeeping method.</E> (1) The owner or operator of a regulated source is subject to the monitoring and recordkeeping requirements of the relevant standard unless permission to use an alternative monitoring or recordkeeping method requested under paragraph (b) of this section or § 65.162(d) has been granted by the Administrator. Once an alternative is approved, the owner or operator shall use the alternative for the emission points or regulated sources cited in the approval and shall meet the monitoring and recordkeeping requirements of the relevant standard for all other emission points or regulated sources.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrator approves the use of an alternative monitoring or recordkeeping method for a regulated source under paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of such source shall continue to use the alternative monitoring or recordkeeping method unless he or she receives approval from the Administrator to use another method.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative monitoring or recordkeeping method, requirement, or procedure, the Administrator may require the use of a method, requirement, or procedure specified in the relevant standard. If the results of the specified and alternative methods, requirements, or procedures do not agree, the results obtained by the specified method, requirement, or procedure shall prevail.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Alternative work practice for monitoring equipment for leaks.</E> This section contains requirements for an alternative work practice used to identify leaking equipment. This alternative work practice is placed here for administrative convenience and is available to all subparts in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that require monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor. Paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section apply to all equipment for which the applicable subpart requires monitoring with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor, except for closed vent systems, equipment designated as leakless, and equipment identified in the applicable subpart as having no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background. An owner or operator may use an optical gas imaging instrument instead of a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor. Requirements in the existing subparts that are specific to the Method 21 instrument do not apply under this section. All other requirements in the applicable subpart that are not addressed in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section continue to apply. For example, equipment specification requirements, and non-Method 21 instrument <PRTPAGE P="38"/>recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the applicable subpart continue to apply. The terms defined in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section have meanings that are specific to the alternative work practice standard in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Applicable subpart</E> means the subpart in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that requires monitoring of each piece of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Equipment</E> means pumps, valves, pressure relief valves, compressors, open-ended lines, flanges, connectors, and other equipment covered by the applicable subpart that require monitoring with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Imaging</E> means making visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Optical gas imaging instrument</E> means an instrument that makes visible emissions that may otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Repair</E> means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, in order to eliminate a leak.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Leak</E> means:</P>
              <P>(i) Any emissions imaged by the optical gas instrument;</P>
              <P>(ii) Indications of liquids dripping;</P>
              <P>(iii) Indications by a sensor that a seal or barrier fluid system has failed; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Screening results using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor that exceed the leak definition in the applicable subpart to which the equipment is subject.</P>
              <P>(f) The alternative work practice standard for monitoring equipment for leaks is available to all subparts in 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, and 65 that require monitoring of equipment with a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor.</P>
              <P>(1) An owner or operator of an affected source subject to 40 CFR parts 60, 61, 63, or 65 can choose to comply with the alternative work practice requirements in paragraph (g) of this section instead of using the 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor to identify leaking equipment. The owner or operator must document the equipment, process units, and facilities for which the alternative work practice will be used to identify leaks.</P>
              <P>(2) Any leak detected when following the leak survey procedure in paragraph (g)(3) of this section must be identified for repair as required in the applicable subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) If the alternative work practice is used to identify leaks, re-screening after an attempted repair of leaking equipment must be conducted using either the alternative work practice or the 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor at the leak definition required in the applicable subparts to which the equipment is subject.</P>
              <P>(4) The schedule for repair is as required in the applicable subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) When this alternative work practice is used for detecting leaking equipment, choose one of the monitoring frequencies listed in Table 3 to subpart A of this part, in lieu of the monitoring frequency specified for regulated equipment in the applicable subpart. Reduced monitoring frequencies for good performance are not applicable when using the alternative work practice.</P>
              <P>(6) When this alternative work practice is used for detecting leaking equipment, the following are not applicable for the equipment being monitored:</P>
              <P>(i) Skip period leak detection and repair;</P>
              <P>(ii) Quality improvement plans; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Complying with standards for allowable percentage of valves and pumps to leak.</P>
              <P>(7) When the alternative work practice is used to detect leaking equipment, the regulated equipment in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section must also be monitored annually using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, Method 21 monitor at the leak definition required in the applicable subpart. The owner or operator may choose the specific monitoring period (for example, first quarter) to conduct the annual monitoring. Subsequent monitoring must be conducted every 12 months from the initial period. Owners or operators must keep records of the annual Method 21 screening results, as specified in paragraph (i)(4)(vii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(g) An owner or operator of an affected source who chooses to use the alternative work practice must comply <PRTPAGE P="39"/>with the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Instrument specifications.</E> The optical gas imaging instrument must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (g)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Alternative means of emission limitation.</E> An owner or operator may request a determination of equivalence for an alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards of this part. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in regulated material emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards (but not performance standards) in this part, the Administrator will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with that requirement.</P>
              <P>(1) The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.</P>
              <P>(2) Any such notice shall be published only after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Content of submittal.</E> (1) In order to obtain approval, any person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that the alternative means achieves equivalent emission reductions. An owner or operator seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance who <PRTPAGE P="41"/>has not previously performed testing shall also submit a proposed test plan. If the owner or operator seeks permission to use an alternative means of compliance based on previously performed testing, they shall submit the results of that testing, a description of the procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator who requests an alternative means of emission limitation shall submit a description of the proposed testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting that will be used and the proposed basis for demonstrating compliance.</P>
              <P>(3) For storage vessels, the owner or operator shall include the results of actual emissions tests using full-size or scale-model storage vessels that accurately collect and measure all regulated material emissions using a given control technique, and that accurately simulate wind and account for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure, or an engineering analysis that the Administrator determines is an accurate method of determining equivalence.</P>
              <P>(4) For proposed alternatives to equipment leak requirements, the owner or operator shall also submit the information and meet the requirements for alternative means of emission limitation specified in § 65.102(b) (alternative means of emission limitation).</P>
              <P>(c) Manufacturers of equipment used to control equipment leaks of a regulated material may request a determination of equivalence for an alternative means of emission limitation for equipment leaks, as specified in § 65.102(c).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> If the Administrator makes a determination that a means of emission limitation is a permissible alternative to the requirements of design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards of this part, the owner or operator shall either comply with the alternative or comply with the requirements of this part.</P>

Nonrepairable valves may not be reassigned to a less frequently monitored subgroup.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator shall determine every 6 months if the overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units is less than 2 percent leaking valves and so indicate the performance in the next periodic report. If the overall performance of total valves in the applicable process unit or group of process units is 2 percent leaking valves or greater, the owner or operator shall no longer subgroup and shall revert to the program required in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section for that applicable process unit or group of process units. An owner or operator can again elect to comply with the valve subgrouping procedures of paragraph (b)(4) of this section if future overall performance of total valves in the process unit or group of process units is again less than 2 percent.

              <SUBJECT>Performance test and flare compliance determination requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Performance tests and flare compliance determinations.</E> Where §§ 65.145 through 65.155 require, or the owner or operator elects to conduct, a performance test of a nonflare control device or a halogen reduction device, or a compliance determination for a flare, the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section apply.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Prior test results and waivers.</E> Initial performance tests and initial flare compliance determinations are required only as specified in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) Unless requested by the Administrator, an owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test or flare compliance determination under this subpart if a prior performance test or compliance determination was conducted using the same methods specified in § 65.158, and either no process changes have been made since the test or the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.</P>

              <P>(2) Individual performance tests and flare compliance determinations may be waived upon written application to <PRTPAGE P="122"/>the Administrator per § 65.164(b)(3) if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the relevant standard(s) on a continuous basis, or the source is being operated under an extension of compliance under 40 CFR part 63, or a waiver of compliance under 40 CFR part 61, or the owner or operator has requested an extension of compliance under 40 CFR part 63, or a waiver of compliance under 40 CFR part 61, and the Administrator is still considering that request.</P>
              <P>(3) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later canceling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notification is given to the owner or operator of the source.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Performance tests and flare compliance determinations schedule.</E> Except as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(viii), (c)(1)(ix), (c)(1)(x), and (c)(1)(xi) of this section, unless a waiver of performance testing or flare compliance determination is obtained under this section or the conditions of another subpart of this part, the owner or operator shall perform such tests specified in the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Unless a waiver of performance testing or flare compliance determination is obtained under this section or the conditions of another subpart of this part, the owner or operator shall perform such tests specified in the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Within 180 days after the effective date of a relevant standard for a new source that has an initial startup date before the effective date of that standard; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 180 days after initial startup for a new source that has an initial startup date after the effective date of a relevant standard; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Within 180 days after the compliance date specified in a referencing subpart for an existing source or within 180 days after startup of an existing source if the source begins operation after the effective date of the relevant 40 CFR part 63 emission standard; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Within 180 days after the compliance date for an existing source subject to an emission standard established pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act; or</P>
              <P>(v) Within 180 days after the termination date of the source's extension of compliance or a waiver of compliance for an existing source that obtains an extension of compliance under 40 CFR 63.6(i) or a waiver of compliance under 40 CFR 61.11; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Within 180 days after the compliance date for a new source, subject to an emission standard established pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act, for which construction or reconstruction is commenced after the proposal date of a relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(d) of the Act but before the proposal date of the relevant standard established pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act (see 40 CFR 63.6(b)(4)); or</P>
              <P>(vii) When a promulgated emission standard under 40 CFR part 63 is more stringent than the standard that was proposed (see 40 CFR 63.6(b)(3)), the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed source subject to that standard for which construction or reconstruction is commenced between the proposal and promulgation dates of the standard shall comply with performance testing requirements within 180 days after the standard's effective date or within 180 days after startup of the source, whichever is later. If the promulgated standard is more stringent than the proposed standard, the owner or operator may choose to demonstrate compliance initially with either the proposed or the promulgated standard. If the owner or operator chooses to comply with the proposed standard initially, the owner or operator shall conduct a second performance test within 3 years and 180 days after the effective date of the standard, or after startup of the source, whichever is later, to demonstrate compliance with the promulgated standard.</P>

              <P>(viii) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the <PRTPAGE P="123"/>regulatory deadline, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(ix) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.</P>
              <P>(x) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(xi) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (c)(1)(viii), (c)(1)(ix), and (c)(1)(x) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to conduct performance tests and compliance determinations at the regulated source at any time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Performance testing facilities.</E> If required to do performance testing, the owner or operator of each new regulated source and, at the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of each existing regulated source, shall provide performance testing facilities as specified in the following:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Performance test procedures for control devices.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General procedures.</E> Where §§ 65.145 through 65.155 require, or the owner or operator elects to conduct, a performance test of a control device or a halogen reduction device, an owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of (a)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) Performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. During the performance test, an owner or operator may operate the control or halogen reduction device at maximum or minimum representative operating conditions for monitored control or halogen reduction device parameters, whichever results in lower emission reduction. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.</P>
              <P>(2) Performance tests shall be conducted and data shall be reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures set forth in this subpart, in each relevant standard, and, if required, in applicable appendices of 40 CFR parts 51, 60, 61, and 63 unless the Administrator allows revisions to the test methods as specified in one or more of the following five paragraphs:</P>
              <P>(i) The Administrator specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a test method with minor or intermediate changes in methodology; or</P>

              <P>(ii) The Administrator approves the use of a major change to a test method, <PRTPAGE P="124"/>the results of which the Administrator has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific regulated source is in compliance; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Intermediate and major changes to a test method shall be validated using the applicable procedures of Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The Administrator waives the requirement for the performance test as provided in § 65.157(b)(2) because the owner or operator of a regulated source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the regulated source is in compliance with the relevant standard; or</P>
              <P>(v) The Administrator approves the use of an equivalent method.</P>
              <P>(3) Each performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, each run shall be conducted for at least 1 hour and under the conditions specified in this section. For the purpose of determining compliance with an applicable standard, the arithmetic mean of results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances beyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.</P>
              <P>(i) For control devices that are used to control emissions from high-throughput transfer racks, and that are capable of continuous vapor processing but do not handle continuous emissions or emissions from high-throughput transfer racks that load simultaneously from multiple loading arms, each run shall represent at least one complete tank truck or tank car loading period during which regulated materials are loaded, and samples shall be collected using integrated sampling or grab samples taken at least four times per hour at approximately equal intervals of time, such as 15-minute intervals.</P>
              <P>(ii) For intermittent vapor processing systems used for controlling high-throughput transfer rack emissions that do not handle continuous emissions or multiple loading arms of a high-throughput transfer rack that load simultaneously, each run shall represent at least one complete control device cycle, and samples shall be collected using integrated sampling or grab samples taken at least four times per hour at approximately equal intervals of time, such as 15-minute intervals.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Test methods.</E> Where §§ 65.145 through 65.155 require, or the owner or operator elects to conduct, a performance test of a control device or a halogen reduction device, an owner or operator shall conduct that performance test using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable. The regulated material concentration and percent reduction may be measured as either total regulated material or as TOC (minus methane and ethane) according to the procedures specified.</P>
              <P>(1) Method 1 or 1A of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites.</P>
              <P>(i) For determination of compliance with a percent reduction requirement of total regulated material or TOC, sampling sites shall be located at the inlet of the control device as specified in the following and at the outlet of the control device:</P>
              <P>(A) For process vents, the control device inlet sampling site shall be located after the final product recovery device.</P>
              <P>(B) If a vent stream is introduced with the combustion air or as a secondary fuel into a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 megawatts (150 million British thermal units per hour), selection of the location of the inlet sampling sites shall ensure the measurement of total regulated material or TOC (minus methane and ethane) concentrations, as applicable, in all vent streams and primary and secondary fuels introduced into the boiler or process heater.</P>

              <P>(ii) For determination of compliance with the 20 parts per million by volume total regulated material or TOC limit in § 65.63(a)(2), § 65.83(a)(1), and 40 CFR <PRTPAGE P="125"/>60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(A), the sampling site shall be located at the outlet of the control device.</P>
              <P>(2) The gas volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) To determine compliance with the 20 parts per million by volume total regulated material or TOC (minus methane and ethane) limit, the owner or operator shall use Method 18 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 to measure either TOC minus methane and ethane or total regulated material, as applicable. Alternatively, any other method or data that have been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63 may be used. Method 25A may be used for transfer racks as detailed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section. The procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration, corrected to 3 percent oxygen.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or a minimum of four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15 minute intervals during the run.</P>
              <P>(ii) The concentration of either TOC (minus methane or ethane) or total regulated material shall be calculated according to the following two paragraphs, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(A) The TOC concentration (C<E T="52">TOC</E>) is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components and shall be computed for each run using Equation 158-1 of this section:</P>

              <P>(iv) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, an excursion means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum or less than the minimum established value except as provided in the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of this paragraph (e) if the owner or operator operates the source in accordance with § 65.3(a).</P>
              <P>(B) Excused excursions described in § 65.156(d)(2) and excursions described in § 65.156(d)(3) do not count toward the number of excursions for purposes of this paragraph (e).</P>

              <P>This part sets forth the procedures by which EPA will administer the noncompliance penalty provisions of section 120 of the Clean Air Act. Subpart A describes the scope of the part, defines key terms and states the manner of operation of these provisions subpart B states which sources of air pollution are subject to these penalties and the form and substance of the notice of noncompliance. Subpart C and the accompanying Technical Support Document and Manual state how a source must compute the penalty which it owes. Subpart D describes the conditions under which an exemption from the penalty may be available, and subpart E sets forth the procedures for requesting such an exemption. Subpart F states how EPA will review penalties calculated by sources under subpart C, and subpart G describes the method of payment. Subpart H provides for adjustment of the penalty after the source has come into compliance and the actual costs of doing so are known. Finally, subpart I states which actions under these regulations are subject to judicial review and on what conditions, and subpart J provides supplemental procedures for adjudicatory hearings.</P>

              <P>(2) Any exemption granted under paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall cease to be effective when the inability to comply ceases to be entirely beyond <PRTPAGE P="148"/>the control of the source owner or operator as defined in this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Except in the case of exemptions based on orders under section 113 (d)(4) or (d)(5) or suspensions under section 110(g), the Administrator may grant an exemption with retroactive effect to the date of the event giving rise to the section 120 predicate order, extension, suspension, or consent decree. In such cases, the exemption from the noncompliance penalty shall run from the date that the basis for the exemption first occurred.</P>

              <P>(2) The air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or processes, including appropriate back-up systems, were designed, and have been maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions;</P>
              <P>(3) Repair of the malfunctioning equipment was undertaken and carried out in an expeditious fashion as soon as the owner or operator knew or should have known that the malfunction existed or that applicable emission limitations were being violated or were likely to be violated;</P>
              <P>(4) All practicable steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions (including any bypass) on ambient air quality;</P>
              <P>(5) The excess emissions were not part of a pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;</P>

              <P>(6) Off-shift and overtime labor were utilized where necessary to ensure that repairs were made as expeditiously as <PRTPAGE P="149"/>possible or that emissions were minimized to the maximum extent possible; and</P>

              <P>(7) The level of economic savings, if any, accruing to the source owner or operator was <E T="03">de minimis.</E>

              <P>(c) Any activity that could have been foreseen, avoided or planned for, or any breakdown that could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable diligence shall not constitute grounds for an exemption under this section. Such activities include, but are not limited to, sudden breakdowns avoidable by better maintenance procedures, phasing in and out of process equipment and routine maintenance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards for approval of State programs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Administrator shall approve any program submitted by a State, or by a local governmental agency where no program has been submitted by a State, for administering the noncompliance penalty provisions of section 120 of the Clean Air Act upon finding that the program conforms to the requirements of the Act and to those of this part and 40 CFR part 66. References to “State program” in this part shall be read as including local governmental agencies and their programs.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator shall not approve any State program that does not provide explicitly for:</P>
              <P>(1) Issuance of a notice of noncompliance, in a manner consistent with procedures under part 66, upon discovery by the State or upon notification by EPA of a violation of applicable legal requirements, which notice satisfies the informational requirements set forth in § 66.13.</P>
              <P>(2) Levels of staffing and funding satisfactory, in the judgment of the Administrator, to implement and enforce the requirements of section 120 in that State, together with adequate provision for maintaining such levels;</P>
              <P>(3) A capability to carry out the financial analysis and procedures specified in these regulations and the Technical Support Document, Instruction Manual, and related Computer Program, available from the Director of Stationary Source Compliance Division, EN-341, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, together with adequate provision for maintaining such capability. Such capability may be provided by trained State personnel or through qualified contractors;</P>

              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, an administrative hearing whenever the owner or operator of a source submits a petition for reconsideration of a notice of noncompliance on the ground that the source either is not in violation of applicable legal requirements, or is entitled to an exemption, or both, or submits a petition to challenge a recalculation of the penalty by the State, provided that such petitions raise issues of fact that would require a hearing under part 66. This hearing need not conform to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 554 as long as its procedures provide for:<PRTPAGE P="157"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) An initial decision by the hearing officer on the record;</P>
              <P>(ii) A hearing officer who has not performed investigative or litigating functions in any enforcement action against the source owner or operator in question;</P>
              <P>(iii) Opportunity for public participation on reasonable notice, including intervention, by interested persons;</P>
              <P>(iv) Opportunity for cross-examination or an equivalent opportunity for confrontation between persons advocating differing positions on material factual matters; and</P>
              <P>(v) An initial decision by the hearing officer within ninety days of commencement of the hearing unless such period is extended upon agreement of the parties.</P>
              <P>(5) Explicit provision for:</P>
              <P>(i) Notice to the Administrator of any determination granting an exemption, or finding a source in violation of applicable legal requirements, and any penalty calculation and payment schedule approved or calculated by the State, together with any information necessary to verify its accuracy;</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 30 days of receipt of a request from the Administrator, transmission of a copy of the record of the hearing held under paragraph (a)(4) or (6) of this section, including any proffered evidence and a ruling on its admissibility and the State's decision on the merits; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Additional reporting and recordkeeping, if necessary, adequate to enable the Administrator to review the State's administration of the program and determine whether it conforms to the Act and to part 66 of these regulations. Such requirements will be specified in the Notice of Delegation to the State.</P>
              <P>(6) A hearing on the question of whether the owner or operator of a source is entitled to an exemption pursuant to § 66.32 or § 66.33 may be informal. The hearing shall be scheduled upon notice to the public. Reasonable opportunity to testify and for submission of questions to the petitioner by members of the public shall be afforded. A record of the hearing shall be made, and the decision of the hearing officer made in writing within a reasonable period of time after the close of the hearing.</P>

              <P>(c) The State may delegate all or part of its responsibilities under its program to a local governmental agency to implement the program within the jurisdiction of the local agency, <E T="03">Provided</E> that the program of the local government agency meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) No State penalty program or program of one of its agents shall be disapproved because it is more stringent than the program established by part 66 or by section 120 where the State or local agent concludes that it has independent authority under State or local law to implement and administer the more stringent portions of the program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Review by the Administrator.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Administrator may, on his own initiative, review any determination by a State or its agent that a source owner or operator is or is not in compliance with applicable legal requirements or is or is not entitled to an exemption, to determine whether <PRTPAGE P="159"/>that determination conforms to the requirements of the Act and part 66 (as modified by § 67.11).</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator shall review any such determination upon receipt of a petition alleging that the State's determination does not conform to the requirements of the Act and part 66 (as modified by § 67.11). Such petition must be filed within 20 days of issuance of the State's decision.</P>
              <P>(c) The Administrator shall give notice in writing to the State or local agent, to the owner or operator of the source, and to the petitioner of his intent to review the determination. Such notice shall be given within 90 days of the Administrator's receipt of the State or local agent's determination. Unless otherwise provided, such notice shall not withdraw EPA's delegation of authority to the State or local agent over the particular facility in question.</P>
              <P>(d) No such State determination shall become final until the expiration of 90 days after the Administrator's receipt of the notice required by § 67.11(b)(5).</P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator does not issue a notice of intent to review within that period, the State determination shall, upon expiration of such period, constitute final action of the Administrator under section 120 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrator issues a notice of intent to review within that period, the State determination shall not become final until the Administrator takes final action after reviewing the determination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedure where no formal State hearing was held.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In reviewing a decision that a source is in compliance with applicable legal requirements or entitled to an exemption for which no hearing conforming to § 67.11(b) (4) or (6) was held, the Administrator shall evaluate the accuracy and adequacy of the documents transmitted to him pursuant to § 67.11(b)(5) and shall invite submission of comments on issues identified by him as relevant to his review.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Administrator concludes that no hearing need have been held and that the State determination was correct, he shall notify the State, the source owner or operator, and other participants of his determination, which shall constitute final agency action by EPA under authority of section 120. If the Administrator concludes that the petition of the source owner or operator presented information which, if true, would have altered the owner or operator's liability for a penalty, he shall upon notice to the State or local agent schedule a hearing in accordance with subpart E of part 66. Such notice shall operate as a withdrawal of EPA's delegation of authority to the State or local agent over the facility in question unless the State or local agent schedules a hearing within 15 days of receipt of the notice.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Administrator concludes that the State determination did not conform to the requirements of the Act or of part 66 (as modified by § 67.11), he shall by written notice revoke the determination. Such revocation shall operate as a withdrawal of EPA's delegation of authority to the State or local agent over the facility in question.

              <SUBJECT>Procedure where a formal State hearing was held.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) In reviewing a decision that a source is in compliance with applicable legal requirements or is entitled to an exemption for which a hearing conforming to § 67.11(b) (4) or (6) was held, the Administrator may invite comment on issues identified by him as relevant to his review and shall propose or make findings as to the correctness of the determination and the accuracy and adequacy of the material transmitted pursuant to § 67.11(b)(5).<PRTPAGE P="160"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator shall notify all participants in the State hearing of his findings and conclusions. If the Administrator concludes that the State determination conformed to the requirements of the Act and of part 66 (as modified by § 66.11), the Administrator's determination shall constitute final administrative action by EPA under authority of Section 120. If the Administrator finds that the State determination did not conform to the requirements of the Act and of part 66 (as modified by § 67.11), the findings shall constitute proposed findings and the notice shall invite participants to file exceptions thereto. If the Administrator considers it desirable, he may schedule a time for argument.</P>
              <P>(c) Within 60 days of receipt of any briefs or exceptions or after oral argument pursuant to paragraph (b), the Administrator shall affirm, modify, or revoke his proposed findings that the State's determination did not conform to the requirements of the Act or of part 66 (as modified by § 67.11). The decision shall be in writing. Notice and a copy of the decision shall be provided to the source owner or operator and to all other participants in the State hearing. The decision shall constitute a final administrative action by EPA under authority of section 120.</P>
              <P>(d) If the Administrator finds that deficiencies in the hearing record prevent him from determining whether the determination of the State or local agent conformed to the requirements of the Act and part 66 (as modified by § 67.11), he shall notify the State or local agent of his finding and specify what deficiencies exist and schedule a hearing pursuant to subpart E of part 66. Such notice shall operate as a withdrawal of EPA's delegation of authority to the State or local agent over the facility in question unless the State or local agent schedules a supplemental hearing to correct the deficiencies within 15 days of receipt of the notice.</P>
              <P>(e) If the Administrator concludes that the source is in violation of applicable legal requirements or is not entitled to an exemption, or both, and unless otherwise ordered in the decision, the source owner or operator shall submit a penalty calculation to the State within 45 days of receipt of the notice of determination.</P>

              <P>(a) The Administrator may on his own initiative or on petition review any initial, interim, or final penalty calculation made or approved by the State or local agent to determine whether it conforms to the requirements of the Act, of part 66, of the Technical Support Document and the Instruction Manual. The Administrator shall notify the State or local agent in writing of his intention to review the calculation within 60 days of receipt by EPA of the calculation or any item considered by the State in making or approving such calculation, whichever occurs later.</P>
              <P>(b) No such State determination shall become final until the expiration of 90 days after the Administrator's receipt of the notice required by § 67.11(b)(5).</P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator does not issue a notice of intent to review within that period, the State determination shall, upon expiration of such period, constitute final action of the Administrator under section 120 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrator issues a notice of intent to review within that period, the State determination shall not become final until the Administrator takes final action after reviewing the determination.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as otherwise provided, a State determination shall be approved if there was a reasonable basis in law and in fact for making the determination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedure where no formal State hearing was held.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In reviewing a penalty calculation for which no hearing conforming to the requirements of § 67.11(b)(4) was held, the Administrator shall evaluate the accuracy and adequacy of the data contained in the documents transmitted to him pursuant to § 67.11(b)(5) and shall invite comments on issues identified by him as relevant to his review.</P>

              <P>(b) If the Administrator concludes that no hearing need have been held and that the State determination was <PRTPAGE P="161"/>correct, he shall notify the State, the source owner or operator, and other participants of his determination, which shall constitute final agency action by EPA under authority of section 120. If the Administrator concludes that the petition of the source owner or operator for reconsideration of a recalculation presented information which, if true, would have altered the amount of the penalty calculated, he shall upon notice to the State schedule a hearing in accordance with subpart F of part 66. Such notice shall operate as a withdrawal of EPA's delegation of authority to the State or local agent over the facility in question unless the State or local agent schedules a hearing within 15 days of receipt of the notice.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Administrator concludes that the determination of the State or local agent not to hold a hearing was proper but that the penalty calculation does not conform to the requirements of the Act or of part 66, he shall by written notice revoke the determination and issue a notice of recalculation to the source owner or operator pursuant to § 66.51. A copy of the notice of recalculation shall be provided to the State or local agent. The notice of recalculation shall constitute final administrative action by EPA under authority of section 120 unless the source owner or operator petitions for reconsideration under § 66.52, in which case it shall operate as a withdrawal by EPA of its delegation of authority to the State or local agent over the facility in question.</P>
              <P>(d) Unless otherwise provided in the Administrator's notice, noncompliance penalties finally determined to be owed shall be paid to the State or local agent.</P>

              <P>(b) The Administrator shall notify all participants in the State hearing of his findings and conclusions. If the Administrator finds that the State determination conformed to the requirements of the Act, part 66 (as modified by § 67.11), the Technical Support Document, and the Instruction Manual, his determination shall constitute a final action pursuant to section 120. If the Administrator finds that the State determination did not conform to the requirements of the Act or of part 66 (as modified by § 67.11) or to the Technical Support Document or Instruction Manual, the findings shall constitute proposed findings, and the notice shall invite participants to file exceptions to his proposed findings and, if necessary, schedule a time for argument.</P>

              <P>(a) Endpoints. For analyses of offsite consequences, the following endpoints shall be used:</P>
              <P>(1) Toxics. The toxic endpoints provided in appendix A of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Flammables. The endpoints for flammables vary according to the scenarios studied:</P>
              <P>(i) Explosion. An overpressure of 1 psi.</P>
              <P>(ii) Radiant heat/exposure time. A radiant heat of 5 kw/m<SU>2</SU> for 40 seconds.</P>
              <P>(iii) Lower flammability limit. A lower flammability limit as provided in NFPA documents or other generally recognized sources.</P>
              <P>(b) Wind speed/atmospheric stability class. For the worst-case release analysis, the owner or operator shall use a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and F atmospheric stability class. If the owner or operator can demonstrate that local meteorological data applicable to the stationary source show a higher minimum wind speed or less stable atmosphere at all times during the previous three years, these minimums may be used. For analysis of alternative scenarios, the owner or operator may use the typical meteorological conditions for the stationary source.</P>
              <P>(c) Ambient temperature/humidity. For worst-case release analysis of a regulated toxic substance, the owner or operator shall use the highest daily maximum temperature in the previous three years and average humidity for the site, based on temperature/humidity data gathered at the stationary source or at a local meteorological station; an owner or operator using the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance may use 25 °C and 50 percent humidity as values for these variables. For analysis of alternative scenarios, the owner or operator may use typical temperature/humidity data gathered at the stationary source or at a local meteorological station.</P>

              <P>(d) Height of release. The worst-case release of a regulated toxic substance shall be analyzed assuming a ground level (0 feet) release. For an alternative scenario analysis of a regulated toxic substance, release height may be determined by the release scenario.<PRTPAGE P="169"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Surface roughness. The owner or operator shall use either urban or rural topography, as appropriate. Urban means that there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees. Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.</P>
              <P>(f) Dense or neutrally buoyant gases. The owner or operator shall ensure that tables or models used for dispersion analysis of regulated toxic substances appropriately account for gas density.</P>
              <P>(g) Temperature of released substance. For worst case, liquids other than gases liquified by refrigeration only shall be considered to be released at the highest daily maximum temperature, based on data for the previous three years appropriate for the stationary source, or at process temperature, whichever is higher. For alternative scenarios, substances may be considered to be released at a process or ambient temperature that is appropriate for the scenario.</P>

The release rate shall be assumed to be the total quantity divided by 10 unless passive mitigation systems are in place.</P>

              <P>(i) The surface area of the pool shall be determined by assuming that the liquid spreads to 1 centimeter deep unless passive mitigation systems are in place that serve to contain the spill and limit the surface area. Where passive mitigation is in place, the surface area of the contained liquid shall be used to calculate the volatilization rate.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the release would occur onto a surface that is not paved or smooth, the owner or operator may take into account the actual surface characteristics.</P>
              <P>(2) The volatilization rate shall account for the highest daily maximum temperature occurring in the past three years, the temperature of the substance in the vessel, and the concentration of the substance if the liquid spilled is a mixture or solution.</P>
              <P>(3) The rate of release to air shall be determined from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool. The owner or operator may use the methodology in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance or any other publicly available techniques that account for the modeling conditions and are recognized by industry as applicable as part of current practices. Proprietary models that account for the modeling conditions may be used provided the owner or operator allows the implementing agency access to the model and describes model features and differences from publicly available models to local emergency planners upon request.</P>

The volatilization rate (release rate) shall be calculated at the boiling point of the substance and at the conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

              <P>(b) For the purposes of determining whether more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance is present at the stationary source, the following exemptions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Concentrations of a regulated toxic substance in a mixture.</E> If a regulated substance is present in a mixture and the concentration of the substance is below one percent by weight of the mixture, the amount of the substance in the mixture need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present at the stationary source. Except for oleum, toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, toluene 2,6-diisocyanate, and toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer), if the concentration of the regulated substance in the mixture is one percent or greater by weight, but the owner or operator can demonstrate that the partial pressure of the regulated substance in the mixture (solution) under handling or storage conditions in any portion of the process is less than 10 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), the amount of the substance in the mixture in that portion of the process need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present at the stationary source. The owner or operator shall document this partial pressure measurement or estimate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Permit content and air permitting authority or designated agency requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) These requirements apply to any stationary source subject to this part 68 and parts 70 or 71 of this chapter. The 40 CFR part 70 or part 71 permit for the stationary source shall contain:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement listing this part as an applicable requirement;</P>
              <P>(2) Conditions that require the source owner or operator to submit:</P>
              <P>(i) A compliance schedule for meeting the requirements of this part by the date provided in § 68.10(a) or;</P>
              <P>(ii) As part of the compliance certification submitted under 40 CFR 70.6(c)(5), a certification statement that the source is in compliance with all requirements of this part, including the registration and submission of the RMP.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator shall submit any additional relevant information requested by the air permitting authority or designated agency.</P>
              <P>(c) For 40 CFR part 70 or part 71 permits issued prior to the deadline for registering and submitting the RMP and which do not contain permit conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator or air permitting authority shall initiate permit revision or reopening according to the procedures of 40 CFR 70.7 or 71.7 to incorporate the terms and conditions consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(d) The state may delegate the authority to implement and enforce the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section to a state or local agency or agencies other than the air permitting authority. An up-to-date copy of any delegation instrument shall be maintained by the air permitting authority. The state may enter a written agreement with the Administrator under which EPA will implement and enforce <PRTPAGE P="206"/>the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) The air permitting authority or the agency designated by delegation or agreement under paragraph (d) of this section shall, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) Verify that the source owner or operator has registered and submitted an RMP or a revised plan when required by this part;</P>
              <P>(2) Verify that the source owner or operator has submitted a source certification or in its absence has submitted a compliance schedule consistent with paragraph (a)(2) of this section;</P>
              <P>(3) For some or all of the sources subject to this section, use one or more mechanisms such as, but not limited to, a completeness check, source audits, record reviews, or facility inspections to ensure that permitted sources are in compliance with the requirements of this part; and</P>
              <P>(4) Initiate enforcement action based on paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section as appropriate.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 68.220</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Audits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In addition to inspections for the purpose of regulatory development and enforcement of the Act, the implementing agency shall periodically audit RMPs submitted under subpart G of this part to review the adequacy of such RMPs and require revisions of RMPs when necessary to ensure compliance with subpart G of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The implementing agency shall select stationary sources for audits based on any of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) Accident history of the stationary source;</P>
              <P>(2) Accident history of other stationary sources in the same industry;</P>
              <P>(3) Quantity of regulated substances present at the stationary source;</P>
              <P>(4) Location of the stationary source and its proximity to the public and environmental receptors;</P>
              <P>(5) The presence of specific regulated substances;</P>
              <P>(6) The hazards identified in the RMP; and</P>
              <P>(7) A plan providing for neutral, random oversight.</P>
              <P>(c) Exemption from audits. A stationary source with a Star or Merit ranking under OSHA's voluntary protection program shall be exempt from audits under paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The implementing agency shall have access to the stationary source, supporting documentation, and any area where an accidental release could occur.</P>
              <P>(e) Based on the audit, the implementing agency may issue the owner or operator of a stationary source a written preliminary determination of necessary revisions to the stationary source's RMP to ensure that the RMP meets the criteria of subpart G of this part. The preliminary determination shall include an explanation for the basis for the revisions, reflecting industry standards and guidelines (such as AIChE/CCPS guidelines and ASME and API standards) to the extent that such standards and guidelines are applicable, and shall include a timetable for their implementation.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Written response to a preliminary determination.</E> (1) The owner or operator shall respond in writing to a preliminary determination made in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The response shall state the owner or operator will implement the revisions contained in the preliminary determination in accordance with the timetable included in the preliminary determination or shall state that the owner or operator rejects the revisions in whole or in part. For each rejected revision, the owner or operator shall explain the basis for rejecting such revision. Such explanation may include substitute revisions.</P>
              <P>(2) The written response under paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be received by the implementing agency within 90 days of the issue of the preliminary determination or a shorter period of time as the implementing agency specifies in the preliminary determination as necessary to protect public health and the environment. Prior to the written response being due and upon written request from the owner or operator, the implementing agency may provide in writing additional time for the response to be received.</P>

              <P>(g) After providing the owner or operator an opportunity to respond under <PRTPAGE P="207"/>paragraph (f) of this section, the implementing agency may issue the owner or operator a written final determination of necessary revisions to the stationary source's RMP. The final determination may adopt or modify the revisions contained in the preliminary determination under paragraph (e) of this section or may adopt or modify the substitute revisions provided in the response under paragraph (f) of this section. A final determination that adopts a revision rejected by the owner or operator shall include an explanation of the basis for the revision. A final determination that fails to adopt a substitute revision provided under paragraph (f) of this section shall include an explanation of the basis for finding such substitute revision unreasonable.</P>
              <P>(h) Thirty days after completion of the actions detailed in the implementation schedule set in the final determination under paragraph (g) of this section, the owner or operator shall be in violation of subpart G of this part and this section unless the owner or operator revises the RMP prepared under subpart G of this part as required by the final determination, and submits the revised RMP as required under § 68.150.</P>
              <P>(i) The public shall have access to the preliminary determinations, responses, and final determinations under this section in a manner consistent with § 68.210.</P>
              <P>(j) Nothing in this section shall preclude, limit, or interfere in any way with the authority of EPA or the state to exercise its enforcement, investigatory, and information gathering authorities concerning this part under the Act.</P>

              <P>(a) Pursuant to section 325(a) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and a petition submitted by the Governor of Guam (“Petition”), the Administrator of the <PRTPAGE P="209"/>Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) conditionally exempts electric generating units on Guam from certain CAA requirements.</P>
              <P>(1) A waiver of the requirement to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration (“PSD”) permit prior to construction is granted for the electric generating units identified in the Petition as Cabras Diesel No. 1, the Tenjo project, and three 6-megawatt diesel generators to be constructed at Orote, with the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) Each electric generating unit shall not be operated until a final PSD permit is issued for that unit;</P>
              <P>(ii) Each electric generating unit shall not be operated until that unit complies with all requirements of its PSD permit, including, if necessary, retrofitting with the best available control technology (“BACT”);</P>
              <P>(iii) The PSD application for each electric generating unit shall be deemed complete without the submittal of the required one year of on-site meteorological data, however, EPA will not issue a PSD permit to such a unit prior to submission of such data or data which the EPA finds to be an equivalent and acceptable substitute; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If any electric generating unit covered by this paragraph is operated either prior to the issuance of a final PSD permit or without BACT equipment, that electric generating unit shall be deemed in violation of this waiver and the CAA beginning on the date of commencement of construction of that unit.</P>
              <P>(2) A waiver of the three nonattainment area requirements (a construction ban, the use of lowest achievable emission rate control equipment, and emission offset requirements) currently applicable to the Cabras-Piti area is granted for electric generating units with the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) A tower and meteorological station shall be constructed in the Cabras-Piti area by May 1, 1993;</P>
              <P>(ii) Meteorological data shall be collected from the Cabras-Piti station which is sufficient to run air quality models both to demonstrate no current exceedences of the primary national ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide (“sulfur dioxide NAAQS”), as set forth at 40 CFR 50.4, and sufficient to submit a complete request for redesignation of the area to attainment;</P>
              <P>(iii) Ambient sulfur dioxide monitors shall be installed and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth at 40 CFR part 58, the PSD air monitoring requirements, and any additional monitoring requested by EPA to verify the efficacy of the intermittent control strategy (“ICS”) of fuel switching;</P>
              <P>(iv) Within three years from the effective date of this waiver, the Governor of Guam shall submit to the EPA a complete request that the Cabras-Piti area be redesignated to attainment for the sulfur dioxide NAAQS;</P>
              <P>(v) Electric generating units to be constructed in the Cabras-Piti area must submit applications for PSD permits as though the area had been redesignated to attainment for the sulfur dioxide NAAQS;</P>
              <P>(vi) The Cabras-Piti area electric generating units shall comply with the fuel switching ICS described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section;</P>
              <P>(vii) If the collected data and air quality analysis does not demonstrate to the EPA's satisfaction that there are no current or likely future exceedences of the sulfur dioxide NAAQS, the EPA will so notify the Governor of Guam;</P>
              <P>(viii) Within six months of such notification, the Governor of Guam shall submit to the EPA an implementation plan which includes a schedule of emission reductions and/or control measures that will ensure achievement of the sulfur dioxide NAAQS within one year of submission of the implementation plan; and</P>
              <P>(ix) If the Governor of Guam fails to submit an implementation plan in a timely fashion, or if EPA disapproves that implementation plan, all electric generating units subject to the fuel switching ICS described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall be fueled exclusively with low sulfur fuel.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Continuing exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Effective on the expiration date of the initial eighteen month exemption provided under section 325(b) of “the Act”, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) exempts the Guam Power Authority's two sixty-six megawatt oil-fired steam units which comprise the Cabras Power Plant from sulfur dioxide requirements associated with New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) under section 111 of the Clean Air Act and from the related NSPS limitation on sulfur dioxide emissions contained in the Guam SIP.</P>

              <P>(b) The exemption will be reviewed at intervals and upon occasions to be specified by EPA (not longer than 2 years), allowing EPA to determine whether the factual circumstances upon which it is based, including commitments made by GPA in the application for extension and the continuing attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Sulfur Dioxide, have changed. The commitments include reporting requirements specified by the Guam Environmental Protection Agency (GEPA), including but not limited to strict implementation of both the monitoring (wind direction and ambient SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration) and fuel switching portions of the control strategy, reporting to GEPA of all applications of the strategy, and reporting to GEPA of laboratory analyses of percent sulfur in all new fuel stocks acquired GPA. A finding by EPA that the source is not in compliance with the terms of the exemption will be grounds for enforcement of the terms of the exemption under section 113. A finding by EPA that factual circumstances have changed will be grounds for revocation of the exemption and enforcement of the underlying Clean Air Act requirements.</P>

              <P>(c) It is a condition of this action that GPA provide to EPA a copy of any GPA application for rate changes or for commercial credit for construction or replacement of capital assets, simultaneously with submission of such application to the rate making authority or commercial credit institution. No later than the 90th day after a finding by EPA that the circumstances upon which the determination for continuing the exemption was originally made have changed, this exemption shall terminate unless within that time GPA submits information that it is taking all practicable steps to comply with NSPS and SIP requirements related to SO<E T="52">2</E>. EPA shall review such information under the procedures it has established and shall, as appropriate, extend or terminate the exemption.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Title V conditional exemption.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditional exemption.</E> In response to a petition submitted by the Governor of Guam and pursuant to section 325(a) of the Clean Air Act (Act), the Administrator of the United States EPA (EPA) grants the following conditional exemptions:</P>
              <P>(1) Guam is exempted from the requirement to develop, submit for approval, and implement an operating permit program under title V of the Clean Air Act on the condition that Guam meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Except for sources listed under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, owners or operators of sources located in Guam subject to the operating permit requirements of title V of the Clean Air Act are exempt from the requirement to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit, on the condition that the owner or operator of each such source must apply for and obtain an operating permit under an EPA approved alternate program that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section. The owner or operator of each such source shall apply for and obtain a permit under the alternate operating permit program by the deadlines set forth in the approved program, but in any event shall obtain a permit no later than January 13, 2003. If the owner or <PRTPAGE P="212"/>operator of any source has not obtained an operating permit under an alternate operating program approved by EPA for Guam by January 13, 2003, the exemption for such source shall expire and the owner or operator of such source shall become subject to the permitting requirements of 40 CFR part 71 on that date, consistent with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon EPA approval of an alternate operating permit program adopted by Guam in accordance with this § 69.13, a person shall not violate any permit condition or term in a permit that has been issued under such alternate permit program.</P>
              <P>(4) This exemption does not apply to owners or operators of major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) as defined under section 112 of the Clean Air Act or to owners or operators of solid waste incinerators subject to the title V requirements of section 129(e) of the Act. Owners or operators of major sources of HAPs or solid waste incinerators shall be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 71 and shall apply for and obtain a part 71 permit by the deadlines specified in 40 CFR part 71. Any owner or operator of a major source of HAPs subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart B, shall submit a timely part 71 permit application as required by 40 CFR part 71 and 40 CFR part 63, subpart B, requesting a case-by-case section 112(g) or 112(j) Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) determination.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements for the alternate operating program.</E> Guam shall develop and submit an alternate operating permit program (the program) to EPA for approval. Upon approval by EPA, Guam shall implement the program. The program, including the necessary statutory and regulatory authority, must be submitted by January 13, 1999 for approval. The submittal shall include the following elements:</P>
              <P>(1) The program must contain regulations that ensure that:</P>
              <P>(i) The permits shall include emission limits and standards, and other terms or conditions necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable federal requirements, as defined under 40 CFR 70.2.</P>
              <P>(ii) The limitations, controls, and requirements in the permits shall be permanent, quantifiable, and otherwise enforceable as a practical matter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Permits shall contain monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable federal requirements during the reporting period.</P>
              <P>(iv) The program shall require that the owner or operator of each source submit permit applications with compliance certifications describing the source's compliance status with all applicable requirements. The program shall also provide that each permit contain a requirement that the owner or operator of a source submit annual compliance certifications. The compliance certification shall contain a compliance plan, and shall contain a schedule for expeditiously achieving compliance if the source is not in compliance with all applicable requirements. The program must provide that approval of a permit with a compliance plan and schedule does not sanction noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(v) If the program chooses to accept electronic documents it must satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).</P>
              <P>(2) The program shall provide for the collection of fees from permitted sources or other revenues in an amount that will pay for the cost of operation of such a program and ensure that these funds are used solely to support the program.</P>
              <P>(3) The program shall provide for public notice and a public comment period of at least 30 days for each permit, significant permit modification, and permit renewal, and shall include submittal to EPA of each permit, significant permit modification, and permit renewal.</P>

              <P>(4) The program shall provide EPA at least 45 days from receipt of a permit, modification, or renewal for EPA review and objection prior to issuance. The program shall provide that if EPA objects to a permit sent to EPA for review, Guam cannot issue such permit until the permit is revised in a manner that resolves EPA's objections. The program shall provide that Guam will have no more than 180 days to resolve <PRTPAGE P="213"/>EPA's objections and that if the objections are not resolved within that time period, EPA shall issue the permit under 40 CFR part 71.</P>
              <P>(5) The program shall provide that all documents other than confidential business information will be made available to the public.</P>
              <P>(6) The program shall provide Guam with the authority to enforce permits, including the authority to assess civil and criminal penalties up to $10,000 per day per violation and to enjoin activities that are in violation of the permit, the program, or the Act without first revoking the permit.</P>
              <P>(7) The program shall require that owners or operators of nonmajor sources of hazardous air pollutants that are required to obtain title V permits, and owners or operators of major sources of all other air pollutants as defined at 40 CFR 70.2 that are exempted from 40 CFR part 71 under paragraph (a) of this section, obtain an operating permit under the approved program. The program shall include a schedule for issuing permits to all subject sources within three years of EPA approval of the program.</P>
              <P>(8) The program shall include a system of regular inspections of permitted sources, a system to identify any unpermitted major sources, and guidelines for appropriate responses to violations.</P>
              <P>(9) The program shall provide for the issuance of permits with a fixed term that shall not exceed five years.</P>
              <P>(10) The program shall allow Guam or the EPA to reopen a permit for cause. The program shall provide that if EPA provides Guam with written notice that a permit must be reopened for cause, Guam shall issue a revised permit within 180 days (including public notice and comment) that sufficiently addresses EPA's concerns. The program shall provide that if Guam fails to issue a permit that resolves EPA's concerns within 180 days, then EPA will terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit under part 71 after providing the permittee and the public with notice and opportunity for comment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal.</E> In conjunction with the submittal of the alternative operating permit program, Guam shall, no later than January 13, 1999 submit a revision to its SIP that provides that a person shall not violate a permit condition or term in an operating permit that has been issued under an EPA approved alternate operating permit program adopted by Guam pursuant to the exemption authorized in this § 69.13.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Expiration and revocation of the exemption.</E> This exemption shall expire or may be revoked under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) If Guam fails to submit an alternate operating permit program by January 13, 1999, the exemption shall automatically expire with no further rulemaking and 40 CFR part 71 shall become effective for all subject sources in Guam on that date.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that EPA disapproves Guam's alternate operating permit program because the program does not meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, EPA will revoke the exemption by rulemaking.</P>
              <P>(3) If, by January 13, 2003, the owner or operator of any subject source has not obtained a federally enforceable operating permit under an EPA approved program, the exemption shall automatically expire for such source and such source shall be subject to the permitting requirements of 40 CFR part 71. Guam will work with EPA to identify such sources prior to expiration of the exemption under this paragraph (d).</P>
              <P>(4) EPA shall revoke the exemption in its entirety through rulemaking if Guam does not adequately administer and enforce an alternate operating permit program approved by EPA.</P>
              <P>(5) EPA shall revoke the exemption by rulemaking with respect to the owner or operator of any source if, during the 45-day review period, EPA objects to issuance of a permit and Guam fails to resolve EPA's objections within 180 days. EPA shall also revoke the exemption by rulemaking for the owner or operator of any source in the event that EPA reopens a permit for cause and Guam does not issue a permit that resolves the concerns as set forth in EPA's notice to reopen within 180 days.</P>

              <P>(6) EPA reserves its authority to revoke or modify this exemption in whole or in part.<PRTPAGE P="214"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Scope of the exemption.</E> This exemption applies solely to the requirement that an owner or operator obtain an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act and the requirement that Guam implement a title V permit program. In addition, this exemption does not apply to owners or operators of sources set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Owners and operators of air pollutant sources are required to comply with all other applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act. For purposes of complying with any applicable requirement that is triggered or implemented by the approval of a title V permit program, the approval date for owners or operators to which this exemption applies shall be the date that EPA approves the alternate program for each territory or, for owners or operators of sources that are subject to 40 CFR part 71, the approval date shall be the effective date of 40 CFR part 71, which is July 31, 1996.</P>
              <P>(f) Final approval of alternate permit program.</P>

              <P>(1) The following sections of Guam's Air Pollution Control Standards and Regulations are granted final approval as Guam's alternate permit program:

              <SUBJECT>New exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Pursuant to section 325(a) of the Clean Air Act and a petition submitted by the Governor of the Virgin Islands, an exemption to section 123 of the Clean Air Act is granted to the Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corporation (HOVIC) at the St. Croix refinery. Specifically, the exemption waives the prohibition on the implementation of an Intermittent Control Strategy (ICS) based upon atmospheric conditions in order to set emission limitations. The emission limitations shall depend upon the sulfur content in the residual oil burned at the refinery.</P>
              <P>(b) The protocol to be followed for the ICS shall be set forth in a Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality (PSD) permit issued to HOVIC; and shall include as a minimum, the conditions listed in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) HOVIC shall maintain a meteorological tower on its property for the purpose of the ICS which meets the required EPA QA/QC operating specifications. At a minimum, the wind direction data will be monitored, collected and reported as 1-hour averages, starting on the hour. If the average wind direction for a given hour is from within the designated sector, the wind will be deemed to have flowed from within the sector for that hour. Each “day” or “block period”, for these purposes will start at midnight and end the following midnight.</P>
              <P>(2) HOVIC shall maintain SO2 ambient monitors and collect ambient SO2 concentration data for the purpose of implementing the ICS at nearby locations approved by EPA and specified in the PSD permit. The ambient monitors must follow the required EPA QA/QC operating specifications. At a minimum, the data will be collected according to EPA approved State and Local Ambient Monitoring Stations procedures found at 40 CFR 58.20, but will, for these purposes, be averaged by the hour, starting on the hour.</P>
              <P>(3) The switch to a lower sulfur fuel (0.5%) will take place when paragraphs (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(i) The winds blow from a 45 degree sector defined as 143 to 187 degrees inclusive, where zero degrees is due north, for at least 6 consecutive hours during a 24-hour block period or any 12 non-consecutive hours during a 24 hour block period.</P>
              <P>(ii) One of HOVIC's ICS monitors measures an average ambient SO2 concentration that is 75% of the 24-hour NAAQS during any rolling 24-hour average. (75% of the 24-hour NAAQS = 274 ug/m3 or 0.105 ppm).</P>
              <P>(4) The switch back to the higher sulfur fuel (1.0%) may occur if the conditions in paragraphs (b)(4)(i), (b)(4)(ii), and (b)(4)(iii) of this section are met.</P>

              <P>(i) If the ICS was triggered by paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the switch back may occur when the winds blow outside the sector listed in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section for at least 3 consecutive hours following the <PRTPAGE P="222"/>period during which the winds were blowing inside the sector.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the ICS was triggered by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the switch back may occur after all of HOVIC's ICS ambient monitors measure a 24-hour average concentration which is less than 75% of the NAAQS for at least one 24-hour block period following any occurrence when the monitor measured the concentration which was 75% of the NAAQS.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the ICS was triggered by both paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the switch back may occur when both of the conditions in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (b)(4)(ii) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(c) The protocol may be modified by EPA to protect against exceedances of the sulfur dioxide NAAQS.</P>
              <P>(d) In the event that there is an exceedance of the NAAQS, HOVIC will report the exceedance to EPA and recommend corrective action as well as amendments to the protocol to ensure the protection of the NAAQS.</P>
              <P>(e) HOVIC must comply with all fuel switching requirements, contained in HOVIC's PSD permit.</P>
              <P>(f) This exemption shall take effect only in the event that a final PSD permit modification becomes effective.</P>
              <P>(g) The Administrator may terminate the exemption through rulemaking procedures upon determining that HOVIC's use of the ICS is causing or contributing to an exceedance of the NAAQS.</P>
              <P>(h) Pursuant to section 325(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and a petition submitted by the Governor of United States Virgin Islands on July 21, 2003, (“2003 Petition”), the Administrator of EPA conditionally exempts Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (“VIWAPA”) from certain CAA requirements.</P>
              <P>(1) A waiver of the requirement to obtain a PSD permit prior to construction is granted for the electric generating unit identified in the 2003 Petition as Unit 23, St. Krum Bay plant in St. Thomas with the following condition:</P>
              <P>(i) Unit 23 shall not operate until a final PSD permit is received by VIWAPA for this unit;</P>
              <P>(ii) Unit 23 shall not operate until it complies with all requirements of its PSD permit, including, if necessary, retrofitting with BACT;</P>
              <P>(iii) If Unit 23 operates either prior to the issuance of a final PSD permit or without BACT equipment, Unit 23 shall be deemed in violation of this waiver and the CAA beginning on the date of commencement of construction of the unit.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Program overview.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The regulations in this part provide for the establishment of comprehensive State air quality permitting systems consistent with the requirements of title V of the Clean Air Act (Act) (42 U.S.C. 7401, <E T="03">et seq.</E>). These regulations define the minimum elements required by the Act for State operating permit programs and the corresponding standards and procedures by which the Administrator will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permit programs.</P>
            <P>(b) All sources subject to these regulations shall have a permit to operate that assures compliance by the source with all applicable requirements. While title V does not impose substantive new requirements, it does require that fees be imposed on sources and that certain procedural measures be adopted especially with respect to compliance.</P>

            <P>(c) Nothing in this part shall prevent a State, or interstate permitting authority, from establishing additional or more stringent requirements not inconsistent with this Act. The EPA will <PRTPAGE P="226"/>approve State program submittals to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Act and these regulations. No permit, however, can be less stringent than necessary to meet all applicable requirements. In the case of Federal intervention in the permit process, the Administrator reserves the right to implement the State operating permit program, in whole or in part, or the Federal program contained in regulations promulgated under title V of the Act.</P>
            <P>(d) The requirements of part 70, including provisions regarding schedules for submission and approval or disapproval of permit applications, shall apply to the permitting of affected sources under the acid rain program, except as provided herein or modified in regulations promulgated under title IV of the Act (acid rain program).</P>
            <P>(e) Issuance of State permits under this part may be coordinated with issuance of permits under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and under the Clean Water Act, whether issued by the State, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</P>
            <P>(f) States that choose to receive electronic documents must satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3—(Electronic reporting) in their program.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 70.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>State program submittals and transition.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Date for submittal.</E> Not later than November 15, 1993, the Governor of each State shall submit to the Administrator for approval a proposed part 70 program, under State law or under an interstate compact, meeting the requirements of this part. If part 70 is subsequently revised such that the Administrator determines that it is necessary to require a change to an approved State program, the required revisions to the program shall be submitted within 12 months of the final changes to part 70 or within such other period as authorized by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Elements of the initial program submission.</E> Any State that seeks to administer a program under this part shall submit to the Administrator a letter of submittal from the Governor or his designee requesting EPA approval of the program and at least three copies of a program submission. The submission shall contain the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A complete program description describing how the State intends to carry out its responsibilities under this part.</P>
            <P>(2) The regulations that comprise the permitting program, reasonably available evidence of their procedurally correct adoption, (including any notice of public comment and any significant comments received on the proposed part 70 program as requested by the Administrator), and copies of all applicable State or local statutes and regulations including those governing State administrative procedures that either authorize the part 70 program or restrict its implementation. The State shall include with the regulations any criteria used to determine insignificant activities or emission levels for purposes of determining complete applications consistent with § 70.5(c) of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) A legal opinion from the Attorney General for the State, or the attorney for those State, local, or interstate air pollution control agencies that have independent legal counsel, stating that the laws of the State, locality, or interstate compact provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the program. This statement shall include citations to the specific states, administrative regulations, and, where appropriate, judicial decisions that demonstrate adequate authority. State statutes and regulations cited by the State Attorney General or independent legal counsel shall be in the form of lawfully adopted State states and regulations at the time the statement is signed and shall be fully effective by the time the program is approved. To qualify as “independent legal counsel,” the attorney signing the statement required by this section shall have full authority to independently represent the State agency in court on all matters pertaining to the State program. The legal opinion shall also include a demonstration of adequate legal authority to carry out the requirements of this part, including authority to carry out each of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Issue permits and assure compliance with each applicable requirement and requirement of this part by all part 70 sources.</P>

            <P>(ii) Incorporate monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, and compliance certification requirements into part 70 permits consistent with § 70.6.<PRTPAGE P="233"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) Issue permits for a fixed term of 5 years in the case of permits with acid rain provisions and issue all other permits for a period not to exceed 5 years, except for permits issued for solid waste incineration units combusting municipal waste subject to standards under section 129(e) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(iv) Issue permits for solid waste incineration units combusting municipal waste subject to standards under section 129(e) of the Act for a period not to exceed 12 years and review such permits at least every 5 years. No permit for a solid waste incineration unit may be issued by an agency, instrumentality or person that is also responsible, in whole or in part, for the design and construction or operation of the unit.</P>
            <P>(v) Incorporate into permits all applicable requirements and requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(vi) Terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue permits for cause.</P>
            <P>(vii) Enforce permits, permit fee requirements, and the requirement to obtain a permit, as specified in § 70.11.</P>
            <P>(viii) Make available to the public any permit application, compliance plan, permit, and monitoring and compliance, certification report pursuant to section 503(e) of the Act, except for information entitled to confidential treatment pursuant to section 114(c) of the Act. The contents of a part 70 permit shall not be entitled to protection under section 115(c) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(ix) Not issue a permit if the Administrator timely objects to its issuance pursuant to § 70.8(c) of this part or, if the permit has not already been issued, to § 70.8(d) of this part.</P>
            <P>(x) Provide an opportunity for judicial review in State court of the final permit action by the applicant, any person who participated in the public participation process provided pursuant to § 70.7(h) of this part, and any other person who could obtain judicial review of such actions under State laws.</P>
            <P>(xi) Provide that, solely for the purposes of obtaining judicial review in State court for failure to take final action, final permit action shall include the failure of the permitting authority to take final action on an application for a permit, permit renewal, or permit revision within the time specified in the State program. If the State program allows sources to make changes subject to post hoc review [as set forth in §§ 70.7(e)(2) and (3) of this part], the permitting authority's failure to take final action within 90 days of receipt of an application requesting minor permit modification procedures (or 180 days for modifications subject to group processing requirements) must be subject to judicial review in State court.</P>
            <P>(xii) Provide that the opportunity for judicial review described in paragraph (b)(3)(x) of this section shall be the exclusive means for obtaining judicial review of the terms and conditions of permits, and require that such petitions for judicial review must be filed no later than 90 days after the final permit action, or such shorter time as the State shall designate. Notwithstanding the preceding requirement, petitions for judicial review of final permit actions can be filed after the deadline designated by the State, only if they are based solely on grounds arising after the deadline for judicial review. Such petitions shall be filed no later than 90 days after the new grounds for review arise or such shorter time as the State shall designate. If the final permit action being challenged is the permitting authority's failure to take final action, a petition for judicial review may be filed any time before the permitting authority denies the permit or issues the final permit.</P>
            <P>(xiii) Ensure that the authority of the State/local permitting Agency is not used to modify the acid rain program requirements.</P>
            <P>(4) Relevant permitting program documentation not contained in the State regulations, including the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Copies of the permit form(s), application form(s), and reporting form(s) the State intends to employ in its program; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Relevant guidance issued by the State to assist in the implementation of its permitting program, including criteria for monitoring source compliance (e.g., inspection strategies).</P>

            <P>(5) A complete description of the State's compliance tracking and enforcement program or reference to any <PRTPAGE P="234"/>agreement the State has with EPA that provides this information.</P>
            <P>(6) A showing of adequate authority and procedures to determine within 60 days of receipt whether applications (including renewal applications) are complete, to request such other information as needed to process the application, and to take final action on complete applications within 18 months of the date of their submittal, except for initial permit applications, for which the permitting authority may take up to 3 years from the effective date of the program to take final action on the application, as provided for in the transition plan.</P>
            <P>(7) A demonstration, consistent with § 70.9, that the permit fees required by the State program are sufficient to cover permit program costs.</P>
            <P>(8) A statement that adequate personnel and funding have been made available to develop, administer, and enforce the program. This statement shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A description in narrative form of the scope, structure, coverage, and processes of the State program.</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of the organization and structure of the agency or agencies that will have responsibility for administering the program, including the information specified in this paragraph. If more than one agency is responsible for administration of a program, the responsibilities of each agency must be delineated, their procedures for coordination must be set forth, and an agency shall be designated as a “lead agency” to facilitate communications between EPA and the other agencies having program responsibility.</P>
            <P>(iii) A description of the agency staff who will carry out the State program, including the number, occupation, and general duties of the employees. The State need not submit complete job descriptions for every employee carrying out the State program.</P>
            <P>(iv) A description of applicable State procedures, including permitting procedures and any State administrative or judicial review procedures.</P>
            <P>(v) An estimate of the permit program costs for the first 4 years after approval, and a description of how the State plans to cover those costs.</P>
            <P>(9) A commitment from the State to submit, at least annually to the Administrator, information regarding the State's enforcement activities including, but not limited to, the number of criminal and civil, judicial and administrative enforcement actions either commenced or concluded; the penalties, fines, and sentences obtained in those actions; and the number of administrative orders issued.</P>
            <P>(10) A requirement under State law that, if a timely and complete application for a permit renewal is submitted, consistent with § 70.5(a)(2), but the State has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit before the end of the term of the previous permit, then:</P>
            <P>(i) The permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has been issued or denied and any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 70.6(f) may extend beyond the original permit term until renewal; or</P>
            <P>(ii) All the terms and conditions of the permit including any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 70.6(f) shall remain in effect until the renewal permit has been issued or denied.</P>
            <P>(11) A transition plan providing a schedule for submittal and final action on initial permit applications for all part 70 sources. This plan shall provide that:</P>
            <P>(i) Submittal of permit applications by all part 70 sources (including any sources subject to a partial or interim program) shall occur within 1 year after the effective date of the permit program;</P>
            <P>(ii) Final action shall be taken on at least one-third of such applications annually over a period not to exceed 3 years after such effective date;</P>
            <P>(iii) Any complete permit application containing an early reduction demonstration under section 112(i)(5) of the Act shall be acted on within 9 months of receipt of the complete application; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Submittal of permit applications and the permitting of affected sources shall occur in accordance with the deadlines in title IV of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.</P>

            <P>(12) Provisions consistent with paragraphs (b)(12)(i) through (iii) of this <PRTPAGE P="235"/>section to allow changes within a permitted facility without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in the terms of total emissions): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the facility provides the Administrator and the permitting authority with written notification as required below in advance of the proposed changes, which shall be a minimum of 7 days, unless the permitting authority provides in its regulations a different time frame for emergencies. The source, permitting authority, and EPA shall attach each such notice to their copy of the relevant permit. The following provisions implement this requirement of an approvable part 70 permit program:</P>
            <P>(i) The program shall allow permitted sources to make section 502(b)(10) changes without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions).</P>
            <P>(A) For each such change, the written notification required above shall include a brief description of the change within the permitted facility, the date on which the change will occur, any change in emissions, and any permit term or condition that is no longer applicable as a result of the change.</P>
            <P>(B) The permit shield described in § 70.6(f) of this part shall not apply to any change made pursuant to this paragraph (b)(12)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) The program may provide for permitted sources to trade increases and decreases in emissions in the permitted facility, where the applicable implementation plan provides for such emissions trades without requiring a permit revision and based on the 7-day notice prescribed in this paragraph (b)(12)(ii) of this section. This provision is available in those cases where the permit does not already provide for such emissions trading.</P>
            <P>(A) Under this paragraph (b)(12)(ii) of this section, the written notification required above shall include such information as may be required by the provision in the applicable implementation plan authorizing the emissions trade, including at a minimum, when the proposed change will occur, a description of each such change, any change in emissions, the permit requirements with which the source will comply using the emissions trading provisions of the applicable implementation plan, and the pollutants emitted subject to the emissions trade. The notice shall also refer to the provisions with which the source will comply in the applicable implementation plan and that provide for the emissions trade.</P>
            <P>(B) The permit shield described in § 70.6(f) of this part shall not extend to any change made under this paragraph (b)(12)(ii) of this section. Compliance with the permit requirements that the source will meet using the emissions trade shall be determined according to requirements of the applicable implementation plan authorizing the emissions trade.</P>
            <P>(iii) The program shall require the permitting authority, if a permit applicant requests it, to issue permits that contain terms and conditions, including all terms required under § 70.6 (a) and (c) of this part to determine compliance, allowing for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted facility solely for the purpose of complying with a federally-enforceable emissions cap that is established in the permit independent of otherwise applicable requirements. The permit applicant shall include in its application proposed replicable procedures and permit terms that ensure the emissions trades are quantifiable and enforceable. The permitting authority shall not be required to include in the emissions trading provisions any emissions units for which emissions are not quantifiable or for which there are no replicable procedures to enforce the emissions trades. The permit shall also require compliance with all applicable requirements.</P>

            <P>(A) Under this paragraph (b)(12)(iii) of this section, the written notification required above shall state when the <PRTPAGE P="236"/>change will occur and shall describe the changes in emissions that will result and how these increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the terms and conditions of the permit.</P>
            <P>(B) The permit shield described in § 70.6(f) of this part may extend to terms and conditions that allow such increases and decreases in emissions.</P>
            <P>(13) Provisions for adequate, streamlined, and reasonable procedures for expeditious review of permit revisions or modifications. The program may meet this requirement by using procedures that meet the requirements of § 70.7(e) or that are substantially equivalent to those provided in § 70.7(e) of this part.</P>
            <P>(14) If a State allows changes that are not addressed or prohibited by the permit, other than those described in paragraph (b)(15) of this section, to be made without a permit revision, provisions meeting the requirements of paragraphs (b)(14) (i) through (iii) of this section. Although a State may, as a matter of State law, prohibit sources from making such changes without a permit revision, any such prohibition shall not be enforceable by the Administrator or by citizens under the Act unless the prohibition is required by an applicable requirement. Any State procedures implementing such a State law prohibition must include the requirements of paragraphs (b)(14) (i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) Each such change shall meet all applicable requirements and shall not violate any existing permit term or condition.</P>
            <P>(ii) Sources must provide contemporaneous written notice to the permitting authority and EPA of each such change, except for changes that qualify as insignificant under the provisions adopted pursuant to § 70.5(c) of this part. Such written notice shall describe each such change, including the date, any change in emissions, pollutants emitted, and any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of the change.</P>
            <P>(iii) The change shall not qualify for the shield under § 70.6(f) of this part.</P>
            <P>(iv) The permittee shall keep a record describing changes made at the source that result in emissions of a regulated air pollutant subject to an applicable requirement, but not otherwise regulated under the permit, and the emissions resulting from those changes.</P>
            <P>(15) Provisions prohibiting sources from making, without a permit revision, changes that are not addressed or prohibited by the part 70 permit, if such changes are subject to any requirements under title IV of the Act or are modifications under any provision of title I of the Act.</P>
            <P>(16) Provisions requiring the permitting authority to implement the requirements of §§ 70.6 and 70.7 of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Partial programs.</E> (1) The EPA may approve a partial program that applies to all part 70 sources within a limited geographic area (e.g., a local agency program covering all sources within the agency's jurisdiction). To be approvable, any partial program must, at a minimum, ensure compliance with all of the following applicable requirements, as they apply to the sources covered by the partial program:</P>
            <P>(i) All requirements of title V of the Act and of part 70;</P>
            <P>(ii) All applicable requirements of title IV of the Act and regulations promulgated thereunder which apply to affected sources; and</P>
            <P>(iii) All applicable requirements of title I of the Act, including those established under sections 111 and 112 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) Any partial permitting program, such as that of a local air pollution control agency, providing for the issuance of permits by a permitting authority other than the State, shall be consistent with all the elements required in paragraphs (b) (1) through (16) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) Approval of any partial program does not relieve the State from its obligation to submit a whole program or from application of any sanctions for failure to submit a fully-approvable whole program.</P>
            <P>(4) Any partial program may obtain interim approval under paragraph (d) of this section if it substantially meets the requirements of this paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Interim approval.</E> (1) If a program (including a partial permit program) submitted under this part substantially meets the requirements of this <PRTPAGE P="237"/>part, but is not fully approvable, the Administrator may be rule grant the program interim approval.</P>
            <P>(2) Interim approval shall expire on a date set by the Administrator (but not later than 2 years after such approval), and may not be renewed. Sources shall become subject to the program according to the schedule approved in the State program. Permits granted under an interim approval shall expire at the end of their fixed term, unless renewed under a part 70 program.</P>
            <P>(3) The EPA may grant interim approval to any program if it meets each of the following minimum requirements and otherwise substantially meets the requirements of this part:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Adequate fees.</E> The program must provide for collecting permit fees adequate for it to meet the requirements of § 70.9 of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Applicable requirements.</E> (A) The program must provide for adequate authority to issue permits that assure compliance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section for those major sources covered by the program.</P>
            <P>(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, where a State or local permitting authority lacks adequate authority to issue or revise permits that assure compliance with applicable requirements established exclusively through an EPA-approved minor NSR program, EPA may grant interim approval to the program upon a showing by the permitting authority of compelling reasons which support the interim approval.</P>
            <P>(C) Any part 70 permit issued during an interim approval granted under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section that does not incorporate minor NSR requirements shall:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Note this fact in the permit;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Indicate how citizens may obtain access to excluded minor NSR permits;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Provide a cross reference, such as a listing of the permit number, for each minor NSR permit containing an excluded minor NSR term; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) State that the minor NSR requirements which are excluded are not eligible for the permit shield under § 70.6(f).</P>
            <P>(D) A program receiving interim approval for the reason specified in (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section must, upon or before granting of full approval, institute proceedings to reopen part 70 permits to incorporate excluded minor NSR permits as terms of the part 70 permits, as required by § 70.7(f)(1)(iv). Such reopening need not follow full permit issuance procedures nor the notice requirement of § 70.7(f)(3), but may instead follow the permit revision procedure in effect under the State's approved part 70 program for incorporation of minor NSR permits.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Fixed term.</E> The program must provide for fixed permit terms, consistent with paragraphs (b)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Public participation.</E> The program must provide for adequate public notice of and an opportunity for public comment and a hearing on draft permits and revisions, except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification procedures under § 70.7(e) of this part.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">EPA and affected State review.</E> The program must allow EPA an opportunity to review each proposed permit, including permit revisions, and to object to its issuance consistent with § 70.8(c) of this part. The program must provide for affected State review consistent with § 70.8(b) of this part.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Permit issuance.</E> The program must provide that the proposed permit will not be issued if EPA objects to its issuance.</P>
            <P>(vii) <E T="03">Enforcement.</E> The program must contain authority to enforce permits, including the authority to assess penalties against sources that do not comply with their permits or with the requirement to obtain a permit.</P>
            <P>(viii) <E T="03">Operational flexibility.</E> The program must allow changes within a permitted facility without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of title I of the act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit, consistent with paragraph (b)(12) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ix) <E T="03">Streamlined procedures.</E> The program must provide for streamlined procedures for issuing and revising permits and determining expeditiously after receipt of a permit application or application for a permit revision whether such application is complete.<PRTPAGE P="238"/>
            </P>
            <P>(x) <E T="03">Permit application.</E> The program submittal must include copies of the permit application and reporting form(s) that the State will use in implementing the interim program.</P>
            <P>(xi) <E T="03">Approval of AOSs.</E> The program submittal must include provisions to insure that AOSs requested by the source as approved by the permitting authority are included in the part 70 permit pursuant to § 70.6(a)(9).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">EPA review of permit program submittals.</E> Within 1 year after receiving a program submittal, the Administrator shall approve or disapprove the program, in whole or in part, by publishing a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Prior to such notice, the Administrator shall provide an opportunity for public comment on such approval or disapproval. Any EPA action disapproving a program, in whole or in part, shall include a statement of the revisions or modifications necessary to obtain full approval. The Administrator shall approve State programs that conform to the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(1) Within 60 days of receipt by EPA of a State program submission, EPA will notify the State whether its submission is complete enough to warrant review by EPA for either full, partial, or interim approval. If EPA finds that a State's submission is complete, the 1-year review period (i.e., the period of time allotted for formal EPA review of a proposed State program) shall be deemed to have begun on the date of receipt of the State's submission. If EPA finds that a State's submission is incomplete, the 1-year review period shall not begin until all the necessary information is received by EPA.</P>
            <P>(2) If the State's submission is materially changed during the 1-year review period, the Administrator may extend the review period for no more than 1 year following receipt of the revised submission.</P>
            <P>(3) In any notice granting interim or partial approval, the Administrator shall specify the changes or additions that must be made before the program can receive full approval and the conditions for implementation of the program until that time.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">State response to EPA review of program</E>—(1) <E T="03">Disapproval.</E> The State shall submit to EPA program revisions or modifications required by the Administrator's action disapproving the program, or any part thereof, within 180 days of receiving notification of the disapproval.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim approval.</E> The State shall submit to EPA changes to the program addressing the deficiencies specified in the interim approval no later than 6 months prior to the expiration of the interim approval.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The effective date of a part 70 program, including any partial or interim program approved under this part, shall be the effective date of approval by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Individual permit transition.</E> Upon approval of a State program, the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of Federal permits for those activities subject to the approved State program, except that the Administrator will continue to issue phase I acid rain permits. After program approval, EPA shall retain jurisdiction over any permit (including any general permit) that it has issued unless arrangements have been made with the State to assume responsibility for these permits. Where EPA retains jurisdiction, it will continue to process permit appeals and modification requests, to conduct inspections, and to receive and review monitoring reports. If any permit appeal or modification request is not finally resolved when the federally-issued permit expires, EPA may, with the consent of the State, retain jurisdiction until the matter is resolved. Upon request by a State, the Administrator may delegate authority to implement all or part of a permit issued by EPA, if a part 70 program has been approved for the State. The delegation may include authorization for the State to collect appropriate fees, consistent with § 70.9 of this part.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Program revisions.</E> Either EPA or a State with an approved program may initiate a program revision. Program revision may be necessary when the relevant Federal or State statutes or regulations are modified or supplemented. The State shall keep EPA apprised of any proposed modifications to its basic statutory or regulatory authority or procedures.<PRTPAGE P="239"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) If the Administrator determines pursuant to § 70.10 of this part that a State is not adequately administering the requirements of this part, or that the State's permit program is inadequate in any other way, the State shall revise the program or its means of implementation to correct the inadequacy. The program shall be revised within 180 days, or such other period as the Administrator may specify, following notification by the Administrator, or within 2 years if the State demonstrates that additional legal authority is necessary to make the program revision.</P>
            <P>(2) Revision of a State program shall be accomplished as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) The State shall submit a modified program description, Attorney General's statement, or such other documents as EPA determines to be necessary.</P>

            <P>(ii) After EPA receives a proposed program revision, it will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a public notice summarizing the proposed change and provide a public comment period of at least 30 days.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Administrator shall approve or disapprove program revisions based on the requirements of this part and of the Act.</P>

            <P>(iv) A program revision shall become effective upon the approval of the Administrator. Notice of approval of any substantial revision shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Notice of approval of nonsubstantial program revisions may be given by a letter from the Administrator to the Governor or a designee.</P>
            <P>(v) The Governor of any State with an approved part 70 program shall notify EPA whenever the Governor proposes to transfer all or part of the program to any other agency, and shall identify any new division of responsibilities among the agencies involved. The new agency is not authorized to administer the program until the revision has been approved by the Administrator under this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(3) Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that circumstances have changed with respect to a State program, he may request, and the State shall provide, a supplemental Attorney General's statement, program description, or such other documents or information as he determines are necessary.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Sharing of information.</E> (1) Any information obtained or used in the administration of a State program shall be available to EPA upon request without restriction and in a form specified by the Administrator, including computer-readable files to the extent practicable. If the information has been submitted to the State under a claim of confidentiality, the State may require the source to submit this information to the Administrator directly. Where the State submits information to the Administrator under a claim of confidentiality, the State shall submit that claim to EPA when providing information to EPA under this section. Any information obtained from a State or part 70 source accompanied by a claim of confidentiality will be treated in accordance with the regulations in part 2 of this chapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Permit applications.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Duty to apply.</E> For each part 70 source, the owner or operator shall submit a timely and complete permit application in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Timely application.</E> (i) A timely application for a source applying for a part 70 permit for the first time is one that is submitted within 12 months after the source becomes subject to the permit program or on or before such <PRTPAGE P="240"/>earlier date as the permitting authority may establish.</P>
            <P>(ii) Part 70 sources required to meet the requirements under section 112(g) of the Act, or to have a permit under the preconstruction review program approved into the applicable implementation plan under part C or D of title I of the Act, shall file a complete application to obtain the part 70 permit or permit revision within 12 months after commencing operation or on or before such earlier date as the permitting authority may establish. Where an existing part 70 permit would prohibit such construction or change in operation, the source must obtain a permit revision before commencing operation.</P>
            <P>(iii) For purposes of permit renewal, a timely application is one that is submitted at least 6 months prior to the date of permit expiration, or such other longer time as may be approved by the Administrator that ensures that the term of the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. In no event shall this time be greater than 18 months.</P>
            <P>(iv) Applications for initial phase II acid rain permits shall be submitted to the permitting authority by January 1, 1996 for sulfur dioxide, and by January 1, 1998 for nitrogen oxides.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Complete application.</E> The program shall provide criteria and procedures for determining in a timely fashion when applications are complete. To be deemed complete, an application must provide all information required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, except that applications for permit revision need supply such information only if it is related to the proposed change. Information required under paragraph (c) of this section must be sufficient to evaluate the subject source and its application and to determine all applicable requirements. The program shall require that a responsible official certify the submitted information consistent with paragraph (d) of this section. Unless the permitting authority determines that an application is not complete within 60 days of receipt of the application, such application shall be deemed to be complete, except as otherwise provided in § 70.7(a)(4) of this part. If, while processing an application that has been determined or deemed to be complete, the permitting authority determines that additional information is necessary to evaluate or take final action on that application, it may request such information in writing and set a reasonable deadline for a response. The source's ability to operate without a permit, as set forth in § 70.7(b) of this part, shall be in effect from the date the application is determined or deemed to be complete until the final permit is issued, provided that the applicant submits any requested additional information by the deadline specified by the permitting authority.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Confidential information.</E> In the case where a source has submitted information to the State under a claim of confidentiality, the permitting authority may also require the source to submit a copy of such information directly to the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duty to supplement or correct application.</E> Any applicant who fails to submit any relevant facts or who has submitted incorrect information in a permit application shall, upon becoming aware of such failure or incorrect submittal, promptly submit such supplementary facts or corrected information. In addition, an applicant shall provide additional information as necessary to address any requirements that become applicable to the source after the date it filed a complete application but prior to release of a draft permit.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Standard application form and required information.</E> The State program under this part shall provide for a standard application form or forms. Information as described below for each emissions unit at a part 70 source shall be included in the application. The Administrator may approve as part of a State program a list of insignificant activities and emissions levels which need not be included in permit applications. However, for insignificant activities which are exempted because of size or production rate, a list of such insignificant activities must be included in the application. An application may not omit information needed to determine the applicability of, or to impose, any applicable requirement, or to evaluate the fee amount required under the schedule approved pursuant to § 70.9 <PRTPAGE P="241"/>of this part. The permitting authority may use discretion in developing application forms that best meet program needs and administrative efficiency. The forms and attachments chosen, however, shall include the elements specified below:</P>
            <P>(1) Identifying information, including company name and address (or plant name and address if different from the company name), owner's name and agent, and telephone number and names of plant site manager/contact.</P>

            <P>(3) The following emission-related information:</P>
            <P>(i) All emissions of pollutants for which the source is major, and all emissions of regulated air pollutants. A permit application shall describe all emissions of regulated air pollutants emitted from any emissions unit, except where such units are exempted under this paragraph (c) of this section. The permitting authority shall require additional information related to the emissions of air pollutants sufficient to verify which requirements are applicable to the source, and other information necessary to collect any permit fees owed under the fee schedule approved pursuant to § 70.9(b) of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) Identification and description of all points of emissions described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section in sufficient detail to establish the basis for fees and applicability of requirements of the Act.</P>
            <P>(iii) Emissions rate in tpy and in such terms as are necessary to establish compliance consistent with the applicable standard reference test method. For emissions units subject to an annual emissions cap, tpy can be reported as part of the aggregate emissions associated with the cap, except where more specific information is needed, including where necessary to determine and/or assure compliance with an applicable requirement.</P>
            <P>(iv) The following information to the extent it is needed to determine or regulate emissions: Fuels, fuel use, raw materials, production rates, and operating schedules.</P>
            <P>(v) Identification and description of air pollution control equipment and compliance monitoring devices or activities.</P>
            <P>(vi) Limitations on source operation affecting emissions or any work practice standards, where applicable, for all regulated pollutants at the part 70 source.</P>

            <P>(i) Citation and description of all applicable requirements, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Description of or reference to any applicable test method for determining compliance with each applicable requirement.</P>
            <P>(5) Other specific information that may be necessary to implement and enforce other applicable requirements of the Act or of this part or to determine the applicability of such requirements.</P>
            <P>(6) An explanation of any proposed exemptions from otherwise applicable requirements.</P>
            <P>(7) Additional information as determined to be necessary by the permitting authority to define proposed AOSs identified by the source pursuant to § 70.6(a)(9) of this part or to define permit terms and conditions implementing any AOS under § 70.6(a)(9) or implementing § 70.4(b)(12) or § 70.6(a)(10) of this part. The permit application shall include documentation demonstrating that the source has obtained all authorization(s) required under the applicable requirements relevant to any proposed AOSs, or a certification that the source has submitted all relevant materials to the appropriate permitting authority for obtaining such authorization(s).</P>
            <P>(8) A compliance plan for all part 70 sources that contains all the following:</P>
            <P>(i) A description of the compliance status of the source with respect to all applicable requirements.</P>
            <P>(ii) A description as follows:</P>

            <P>(A) For applicable requirements with which the source is in compliance, a <PRTPAGE P="242"/>statement that the source will continue to comply with such requirements.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Permit content.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Standard permit requirements.</E> Each permit issued under this part shall include the following elements:</P>
            <P>(1) Emissions limitations and standards, including those operational requirements and limitations that assure compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance. Such requirements and limitations may include ARMs identified by the source in its part 70 permit application as approved by the permitting authority, provided that no ARM shall contravene any terms needed to comply with any otherwise applicable requirement or requirement of this part or circumvent any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of implementing the ARM.</P>
            <P>(i) The permit shall specify and reference the origin of and authority for each term or condition, and identify any difference in form as compared to the applicable requirement upon which the term or condition is based.</P>
            <P>(ii) The permit shall state that, where an applicable requirement of the Act is more stringent than an applicable requirement of regulations promulgated under title IV of the Act, both provisions shall be incorporated into the permit and shall be enforceable by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(iii) If an applicable implementation plan allows a determination of an alternative emission limit at a part 70 source, equivalent to that contained in the plan, to be made in the permit issuance, renewal, or significant modification process, and the State elects to use such process, any permit containing such equivalency determination shall contain provisions to ensure that any resulting emissions limit has been demonstrated to be quantifiable, accountable, enforceable, and based on replicable procedures.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Permit duration.</E> The permitting authority shall issue permits for a fixed term of 5 years in the case of affected sources, and for a term not to exceed 5 years in the case of all other sources. Notwithstanding this requirement, the permitting authority shall issue permits for solid waste incineration units combusting municipal waste subject to standards under section 129(e) of the Act for a period not to exceed 12 years and shall review such permits at least every 5 years.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Monitoring and related recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</E> (i) Each permit shall contain the following requirements with respect to monitoring:</P>
            <P>(A) All monitoring and analysis procedures or test methods required under applicable monitoring and testing requirements, including part 64 of this chapter and any other procedures and methods that may be promulgated pursuant to sections 114(a)(3) or 504(b) of the Act. If more than one monitoring or testing requirement applies, the permit may specify a streamlined set of monitoring or testing provisions provided the specified monitoring or testing is adequate to assure compliance at least to the same extent as the monitoring or testing applicable requirements that are not included in the permit as a result of such streamlining;</P>

            <P>(B) Where the applicable requirement does not require periodic testing or instrumental or noninstrumental monitoring (which may consist of recordkeeping designed to serve as monitoring), periodic monitoring sufficient to yield reliable data from the relevant time period that are representative of the source's compliance with the permit, as reported pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section. Such monitoring requirements shall assure use of terms, test methods, units, averaging <PRTPAGE P="244"/>periods, and other statistical conventions consistent with the applicable requirement. Recordkeeping provisions may be sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(C) As necessary, requirements concerning the use, maintenance, and, where appropriate, installation of monitoring equipment or methods.</P>
            <P>(ii) With respect to recordkeeping, the permit shall incorporate all applicable recordkeeping requirements and require, where applicable, the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Records of required monitoring information that include the following:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The date, place as defined in the permit, and time of sampling or measurements;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The date(s) analyses were performed;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The company or entity that performed the analyses;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The analytical techniques or methods used;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The results of such analyses; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The operating conditions as existing at the time of sampling or measurement;</P>
            <P>(B) Retention of records of all required monitoring data and support information for a period of at least 5 years from the date of the monitoring sample, measurement, report, or application. Support information includes all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip-chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, and copies of all reports required by the permit.</P>
            <P>(iii) With respect to reporting, the permit shall incorporate all applicable reporting requirements and require the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Submittal of reports of any required monitoring at least every 6 months. All instances of deviations from permit requirements must be clearly identified in such reports. All required reports must be certified by a responsible official consistent with § 70.5(d) of this part.</P>
            <P>(B) Prompt reporting of deviations from permit requirements, including those attributable to upset conditions as defined in the permit, the probable cause of such deviations, and any corrective actions or preventive measures taken. The permitting authority shall define “prompt” in relation to the degree and type of deviation likely to occur and the applicable requirements.</P>
            <P>(4) A permit condition prohibiting emissions exceeding any allowances that the source lawfully holds under title IV of the Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder.</P>
            <P>(i) No permit revision shall be required for increases in emissions that are authorized by allowances acquired pursuant to the acid rain program, provided that such increases do not require a permit revision under any other applicable requirement.</P>
            <P>(ii) No limit shall be placed on the number of allowances held by the source. The source may not, however, use allowances as a defense to noncompliance with any other applicable requirement.</P>
            <P>(iii) Any such allowance shall be accounted for according to the procedures established in regulations promulgated under title IV of the Act.</P>
            <P>(5) A severability clause to ensure the continued validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge to any portions of the permit.</P>
            <P>(6) Provisions stating the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The permittee must comply with all conditions of the part 70 permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application.</P>
            <P>(ii) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit.</P>
            <P>(iii) The permit may be modified, revoked, reopened, and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition.</P>

            <P>(iv) The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.<PRTPAGE P="245"/>
            </P>
            <P>(v) The permittee shall furnish to the permitting authority, within a reasonable time, any information that the permitting authority may request in writing to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing, or terminating the permit or to determine compliance with the permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the permitting authority copies of records required to be kept by the permit or, for information claimed to be confidential, the permittee may furnish such records directly to the Administrator along with a claim of confidentiality.</P>
            <P>(7) A provision to ensure that a part 70 source pays fees to the permitting authority consistent with the fee schedule approved pursuant to § 70.9 of this part.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Emissions trading.</E> A provision stating that no permit revision shall be required, under any approved economic incentives, marketable permits, emissions trading and other similar programs or processes for changes that are provided for in the permit.</P>
            <P>(9) Terms and conditions for reasonably anticipated AOSs identified by the source in its application as approved by the permitting authority. Such terms and conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) Shall require the source, contemporaneously with making a change from one operating scenario to another, to record in a log at the permitted facility a record of the AOS under which it is operating;</P>
            <P>(ii) May extend the permit shield described in paragraph (f) of this section to all terms and conditions under each such AOS; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Must ensure that the terms and conditions of each AOS meet all applicable requirements and the requirements of this part. The permitting authority shall not approve a proposed AOS into the part 70 permit until the source has obtained all authorizations required under any applicable requirement relevant to that AOS.</P>
            <P>(10) Terms and conditions, if the permit applicant requests them, for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted facility, to the extent that the applicable requirements provide for trading such increases and decreases without a case-by-case approval of each emissions trade. Such terms and conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) Shall include all terms required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section to determine compliance;</P>
            <P>(ii) May extend the permit shield described in paragraph (f) of this section to all terms and conditions that allow such increases and decreases in emissions; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Must meet all applicable requirements and requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Federally-enforceable requirements.</E> (1) All terms and conditions in a part 70 permit, including any provisions designed to limit a source's potential to emit, are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens under the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the permitting authority shall specifically designate as not being federally enforceable under the Act any terms and conditions included in the permit that are not required under the Act or under any of its applicable requirements. Terms and conditions so designated are not subject to the requirements of §§ 70.7, 70.8, or of this part, other than those contained in this paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance requirements.</E> All part 70 permits shall contain the following elements with respect to compliance:</P>
            <P>(1) Consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, compliance certification, testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit. Any document (including reports) required by a part 70 permit shall contain a certification by a responsible official that meets the requirements of § 70.5(d) for this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Inspection and entry requirements that require that, upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the permittee shall allow the permitting authority or an authorized representative to perform the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Enter upon the permittee's premises where a part 70 source is located or emissions-related activity is conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of the permit;</P>

            <P>(ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must <PRTPAGE P="246"/>be kept under the conditions of the permit;</P>
            <P>(iii) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under the permit; and</P>
            <P>(iv) As authorized by the Act, sample or monitor at reasonable times substances or parameters for the purpose of assuring compliance with the permit or applicable requirements.</P>
            <P>(3) A schedule of compliance consistent with § 70.5(c)(8) of this part.</P>
            <P>(4) Progress reports consistent with an applicable schedule of compliance and § 70.5(c)(8) of this part to be submitted at least semiannually, or at a more frequent period if specified in the applicable requirement or by the permitting authority. Such progress reports shall contain the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Dates for achieving the activities, milestones, or compliance required in the schedule of compliance, and dates when such activities, milestones or compliance were achieved; and</P>
            <P>(ii) An explanation of why any dates in the schedule of compliance were not or will not be met, and any preventive or corrective measures adopted.</P>
            <P>(5) Requirements for compliance certification with terms and conditions contained in the permit, including emission limitations, standards, or work practices. Permits shall include each of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The frequency (not less than annually or such more frequent periods as specified in the applicable requirement or by the permitting authority) of submissions of compliance certifications;</P>
            <P>(ii) In accordance with § 70.6(a)(3) of this part, a means for monitoring the compliance of the source with its emissions limitations, standards, and work practices;</P>
            <P>(iii) A requirement that the compliance certification include all of the following (provided that the identification of applicable information may cross-reference the permit or previous reports, as applicable):</P>
            <P>(A) The identification of each term or condition of the permit that is the basis of the certification;</P>
            <P>(B) The identification of the method(s) or other means used by the owner or operator for determining the compliance status with each term and condition during the certification period. Such methods and other means shall include, at a minimum, the methods and means required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If necessary, the owner or operator also shall identify any other material information that must be included in the certification to comply with section 113(c)(2) of the Act, which prohibits knowingly making a false certification or omitting material information;</P>
            <P>(C) The status of compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit for the period covered by the certification, including whether compliance during the period was continuous or intermittent. The certification shall be based on the method or means designated in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section. The certification shall identify each deviation and take it into account in the compliance certification. The certification shall also identify as possible exceptions to compliance any periods during which compliance is required and in which an excursion or exceedance as defined under part 64 of this chapter occurred; and</P>
            <P>(D) Such other facts as the permitting authority may require to determine the compliance status of the source.</P>
            <P>(iv) A requirement that all compliance certifications be submitted to the Administrator as well as to the permitting authority.</P>
            <P>(6) Such other provisions as the permitting authority may require.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">General permits.</E> (1) The permitting authority may, after notice and opportunity for public participation provided under § 70.7(h) of this part, issue a general permit covering numerous similar sources. Any general permit shall comply with all requirements applicable to other part 70 permits and shall identify criteria by which sources may qualify for the general permit. To sources that qualify, the permitting authority shall grant the conditions and terms of the general permit. Notwithstanding the shield provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, the source shall be subject to enforcement action for operation without a part 70 permit if the source is later determined not to qualify for the conditions and terms of the general <PRTPAGE P="247"/>permit. General permits shall not be authorized for affected sources under the acid rain program unless otherwise provided in regulations promulgated under title IV of the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) Part 70 sources that would qualify for a general permit must apply to the permitting authority for coverage under the terms of the general permit or must apply for a part 70 permit consistent with § 70.5 of this part. The permitting authority may, in the general permit, provide for applications which deviate from the requirements of § 70.5 of this part, provided that such applications meet the requirements of title V of the Act, and include all information necessary to determine qualification for, and to assure compliance with, the general permit. Without repeating the public participation procedures required under § 70.7(h) of this part, the permitting authority may grant a source's request for authorization to operate under a general permit, but such a grant shall not be a final permit action for purposes of judicial review.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Temporary sources.</E> The permitting authority may issue a single permit authorizing emissions from similar operations by the same source owner or operator at multiple temporary locations. The operation must be temporary and involve at least one change of location during the term of the permit. No affected source shall be permitted as a temporary source. Permits for temporary sources shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Conditions that will assure compliance with all applicable requirements at all authorized locations;</P>
            <P>(2) Requirements that the owner or operator notify the permitting authority at least 10 days in advance of each change in location; and</P>
            <P>(3) Conditions that assure compliance with all other provisions of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Permit shield.</E> (1) Except as provided in this part, the permitting authority may expressly include in a part 70 permit a provision stating that compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance with any applicable requirements as of the date of permit issuance, provided that:</P>
            <P>(i) Such applicable requirements are included and are specifically identified in the permit; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The permitting authority, in acting on the permit application or revision, determines in writing that other requirements specifically identified are not applicable to the source, and the permit includes the determination or a concise summary thereof.</P>
            <P>(2) A part 70 permit that does not expressly state that a permit shield exists shall be presumed not to provide such a shield.</P>
            <P>(3) Nothing in this paragraph or in any part 70 permit shall alter or affect the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The provisions of section 303 of the Act (emergency orders), including the authority of the Administrator under that section;</P>
            <P>(ii) The liability of an owner or operator of a source for any violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance;</P>
            <P>(iii) The applicable requirements of the acid rain program, consistent with section 408(a) of the Act; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The ability of EPA to obtain information from a source pursuant to section 114 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Emergency provision</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> An “emergency” means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, which situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to exceed a technology-based emission limitation under the permit, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of an emergency.</E> An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology-based emission limitations if the conditions of paragraph (g)(3) of this section are met.</P>

            <P>(3) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be demonstrated through <PRTPAGE P="248"/>properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:</P>
            <P>(i) An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the emergency;</P>
            <P>(ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;</P>
            <P>(iii) During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission standards, or other requirements in the permit; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The permittee submitted notice of the emergency to the permitting authority within 2 working days of the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to the emergency. This notice fulfills the requirement of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken.</P>
            <P>(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an emergency has the burden of proof.</P>
            <P>(5) This provision is in addition to any emergency or upset provision contained in any applicable requirement.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Permit issuance, renewal, reopenings, and revisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Action on application.</E> (1) A permit, permit modification, or renewal may be issued only if all of the following condition have been met:</P>
            <P>(i) The permitting authority has received a complete application for a permit, permit modification, or permit renewal, except that a complete application need not be received before issuance of a general permit under § 70.6(d) of this part;</P>
            <P>(ii) Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification procedures under paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section, the permitting authority has complied with the requirements for public participation under paragraph (h) of this section;</P>
            <P>(iii) The permitting authority has complied with the requirements for notifying and responding to affected States under § 70.8(b) of this part;</P>
            <P>(iv) The conditions of the permit provide for compliance with all applicable requirements and the requirements of this part; and</P>
            <P>(v) The Administrator has received a copy of the proposed permit and any notices required under §§ 70.8(a) and 70.8(b) of this part, and has not objected to issuance of the permit under § 70.8(c) of this part within the time period specified therein.</P>
            <P>(2) Except as provided under the initial transition plan provided for under § 70.4(b)(11) of this part or under regulations promulgated under title IV of title V of the Act for the permitting of affected sources under the acid rain program, the program shall provide that the permitting authority take final action on each permit application (including a request for permit modification or renewal) within 18 months, or such lesser time approved by the Administrator, after receiving a complete application.</P>
            <P>(3) The program shall also contain reasonable procedures to ensure priority is given to taking action on applications for construction or modification under title I, parts C and D of the Act.</P>
            <P>(4) The permitting authority shall promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless the permitting authority requests additional information or otherwise notifies the applicant of incompleteness within 60 days of receipt of an application, the application shall be deemed complete. For modifications processed through minor permit modification procedures, such as those in paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section, the State program need not require a completeness determination.</P>

            <P>(5) The permitting authority shall provide a statement that sets forth the legal and factual basis for the draft permit conditions (including references to the applicable statutory or regulatory provisions). The permitting authority shall send this statement to EPA and to any other person who requests it.<PRTPAGE P="249"/>
            </P>
            <P>(6) The submittal of a complete application shall not affect the requirement that any source have a preconstruction permit under title I of the Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirement for a permit.</E> Except as provided in the following sentence, § 70.4(b)(12)(i), and paragraphs (e) (2)(v) and (3)(v) of this section, no part 70 source may operate after the time that it is required to submit a timely and complete application under an approved permit program, except in compliance with a permit issued under a part 70 program. The program shall provide that, if a part 70 source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance (including for renewal), the source's failure to have a part 70 permit is not a violation of this part until the permitting authority takes final action on the permit application, except as noted in this section. This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and as required by § 70.5(a)(2) of this part, the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the permitting authority any additional information identified as being needed to process the application.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Permit renewal and expiration.</E> (1) The program shall provide that:</P>
            <P>(i) Permits being renewed are subject to the same procedural requirements, including those for public participation, affected State and EPA review, that apply to initial permit issuance; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Permit expiration terminates the source's right to operate unless a timely and complete renewal application has been submitted consistent with paragraph (b) of this section and § 70.5(a)(1)(iii) of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) If the permitting authority fails to act in a timely way on a permit renewal, EPA may invoke its authority under section 505(e) of the Act to terminate or revoke and reissue the permit.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Administrative permit amendments.</E> (1) An “administrative permit amendment” is a permit revision that:</P>
            <P>(i) Corrects typographical errors;</P>
            <P>(ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source;</P>
            <P>(iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee;</P>
            <P>(iv) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of a source where the permitting authority determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the permitting authority;</P>
            <P>(v) Incorporates into the part 70 permit the requirements from preconstruction review permits authorized under an EPA-approved program, provided that such a program meets procedural requirements substantially equivalent to the requirements of §§ 70.7 and 70.8 of this part that would be applicable to the change if it were subject to review as a permit modification, and compliance requirements substantially equivalent to those contained in § 70.6 of this part; or</P>
            <P>(vi) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined as part of the approved part 70 program to be similar to those in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Administrative permit amendments for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by regulations promulgated under title IV of the Act.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Administrative permit amendment procedures.</E> An administrative permit amendment may be made by the permitting authority consistent with the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The permitting authority shall take no more than 60 days from receipt of a request for an administrative permit amendment to take final action on such request, and may incorporate such changes without providing notice to the public or affected States provided that it designates any such permit revisions as having been made pursuant to this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(ii) The permitting authority shall submit a copy of the revised permit to the Administrator.</P>

            <P>(iii) The source may implement the changes addressed in the request for an <PRTPAGE P="250"/>administrative amendment immediately upon submittal of the request.</P>
            <P>(4) The permitting authority may, upon taking final action granting a request for an administrative permit amendment, allow coverage by the permit shield in § 70.6(f) for administrative permit amendments made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section which meet the relevant requirements of §§ 70.6, 70.7, and 70.8 for significant permit modifications.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Permit modification.</E> A permit modification is any revision to a part 70 permit that cannot be accomplished under the program's provisions for administrative permit amendments under paragraph (d) of this section. A permit modification for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by regulations promulgated under title IV of the Act.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Program description.</E> The State shall provide adequate, streamlined, and reasonable procedures for expeditiously processing permit modifications. The State may meet this obligation by adopting the procedures set forth below or ones substantially equivalent. The State may also develop different procedures for different types of modifications depending on the significance and complexity of the requested modification, but EPA will not approve a part 70 program that has modification procedures that provide for less permitting authority, EPA, or affected State review or public participation than is provided for in this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Minor permit modification procedures</E>—(i) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> (A) Minor permit modification procedures may be used only for those permit modifications that:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Do not violate any applicable requirement;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Do not involve significant changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements in the permit;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an emission limitation or other standard, or a source-specific determination for temporary sources of ambient impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Do not seek to establish or change a permit term or condition for which there is no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has assumed to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would otherwise be subject. Such terms and conditions include:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">A</E>) A federally enforceable emissions cap assumed to avoid classification as a modification under any provision of title I; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">B</E>) An alternative emissions limit approved pursuant to regulations promulgated under section 112(i)(5) of the Act;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Are not required by the State program to be processed as a significant modification.</P>
            <P>(B) Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(3)(i) of this section, minor permit modification procedures may be used for permit modifications involving the use of economic incentives, marketable permits, emissions trading, and other similar approaches, to the extent that such minor permit modification procedures are explicitly provided for in an applicable implementation plan or in applicable requirements promulgated by EPA.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Application.</E> An application requesting the use of minor permit modification procedures shall meet the requirements of § 70.5(c) of this part and shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(A) A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the change occurs;</P>
            <P>(B) The source's suggested draft permit;</P>
            <P>(C) Certification by a responsible official, consistent with § 70.5(d), that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of minor permit modification procedures and a request that such procedures be used; and</P>
            <P>(D) Completed forms for the permitting authority to use to notify the Administrator and affected States as required under § 70.8.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">EPA and affected State notification.</E> Within 5 working days of receipt of a complete permit modification application, the permitting authority shall meet its obligation under § 70.8 <PRTPAGE P="251"/>(a)(1) and (b)(1) to notify the Administrator and affected States of the requested permit modification. The permitting authority promptly shall send any notice required under § 70.8(b)(2) to the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Timetable for issuance.</E> The permitting authority may not issue a final permit modification until after EPA's 45-day review period or until EPA has notified the permitting authority that EPA will not object to issuance of the permit modification, whichever is first, although the permitting authority can approve the permit modification prior to that time. Within 90 days of the permitting authority's receipt of an application under minor permit modification procedures or 15 days after the end of the Administrator's 45-day review period under § 70.8(c), whichever is later, the permitting authority shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Issue the permit modification as proposed;</P>
            <P>(B) Deny the permit modification application;</P>
            <P>(C) Determine that the requested modification does not meet the minor permit modification criteria and should be reviewed under the significant modification procedures; or</P>
            <P>(D) Revise the draft permit modification and transmit to the Administrator the new proposed permit modification as required by § 70.8(a) of this part.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Source's ability to make change.</E> The State program may allow the source to make the change proposed in its minor permit modification application immediately after it files such application. After the source makes the change allowed by the preceding sentence, and until the permitting authority takes any of the actions specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(v) (A) through (C) of this section, the source must comply with both the applicable requirements governing the change and the proposed permit terms and conditions. During this time period, the source need not comply with the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify. However, if the source fails to comply with its proposed permit terms and conditions during this time period, the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify may be enforced against it.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Permit shield.</E> The permit shield under § 70.6(f) of this part may not extend to minor permit modifications.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Group processing of minor permit modifications.</E> Consistent with this paragraph, the permitting authority may modify the procedure outlined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section to process groups of a source's applications for certain modifications eligible for minor permit modification processing.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Group processing of modifications may be used only for those permit modifications:</P>
            <P>(A) That meet the criteria for minor permit modification procedures under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section; and</P>

            <P>(B) That collectively are below the threshold level approved by the Administrator as part of the approved program. Unless the State sets an alternative threshold consistent with the criteria set forth in paragraphs (e)(3)(i)(B) (<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, this threshold shall be 10 percent of the emissions allowed by the permit for the emissions unit for which the change is requested, 20 percent of the applicable definition of major source in § 70.2 of this part, or 5 tons per year, whichever is least. In establishing any alternative threshold, the State shall consider:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Whether group processing of amounts below the threshold levels reasonably alleviates severe administrative burdens that would be imposed by immediate permit modification review, and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Whether individual processing of changes below the threshold levels would result in trivial environmental benefits.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Application.</E> An application requesting the use of group processing procedures shall meet the requirements of § 70.5(c) of this part and shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(A) A description of the change, the emissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that will apply if the change occurs.</P>
            <P>(B) The source's suggested draft permit.</P>

            <P>(C) Certification by a responsible official, consistent with § 70.5(d) of this part, that the proposed modification meets the criteria for use of group <PRTPAGE P="252"/>processing procedures and a request that such procedures be used.</P>
            <P>(D) A list of the source's other pending applications awaiting group processing, and a determination of whether the requested modification, aggregated with these other applications, equals or exceeds the threshold set under paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
            <P>(E) Certification, consistent with § 70.5(d) of this part, that the source has notified EPA of the proposed modification. Such notification need only contain a brief description of the requested modification.</P>
            <P>(F) Completed forms for the permitting authority to use to notify the Administrator and affected States as required under § 70.8 of this part.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">EPA and affected State notification.</E> On a quarterly basis or within 5 business days of receipt of an application demonstrating that the aggregate of a source's pending applications equals or exceeds the threshold level set under paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this section, whichever is earlier, the permitting authority promptly shall meet its obligations under §§ 70.8 (a)(1) and (b)(1) to notify the Administrator and affected States of the requested permit modifications. The permitting authority shall send any notice required under § 70.8(b)(2) of this part to the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Timetable for issuance.</E> The provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section shall apply to modifications eligible for group processing, except that the permitting authority shall take one of the actions specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section within 180 days of receipt of the application or 15 days after the end of the Administrator's 45-day review period under § 70.8(c) of this part, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Source's ability to make change.</E> The provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section shall apply to modifications eligible for group processing.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Permit shield.</E> The provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section shall also apply to modifications eligible for group processing.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Significant modification procedures</E>—(i) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Significant modification procedures shall be used for applications requesting permit modifications that do not qualify as minor permit modifications or as administrative amendments. The State program shall contain criteria for determining whether a change is significant. At a minimum, every significant change in existing monitoring permit terms or conditions and every relaxation of reporting or recordkeeping permit terms or conditions shall be considered significant. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the permittee from making changes consistent with this part that would render existing permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant.</P>
            <P>(ii) The State program shall provide that significant permit modifications shall meet all requirements of this part, including those for applications, public participation, review by affected States, and review by EPA, as they apply to permit issuance and permit renewal. The permitting authority shall design and implement this review process to complete review on the majority of significant permit modifications within 9 months after receipt of a complete application.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Reopening for cause.</E> (1) Each issued permit shall include provisions specifying the conditions under which the permit will be reopened prior to the expiration of the permit. A permit shall be reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(i) Additional applicable requirements under the Act become applicable to a major part 70 source with a remaining permit term of 3 or more years. Such a reopening shall be completed not later than 18 months after promulgation of the applicable requirement. No such reopening is required if the effective date of the requirement is later than the date on which the permit is due to expire, unless the original permit or any of its terms and conditions has been extended pursuant to § 70.4(b)(10) (i) or (ii) of this part.</P>

            <P>(ii) Additional requirements (including excess emissions requirements) become applicable to an affected source under the acid rain program. Upon approval by the Administrator, excess emissions offset plans shall be deemed to be incorporated into the permit.<PRTPAGE P="253"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) The permitting authority or EPA determines that the permit contains a material mistake or that inaccurate statements were made in establishing the emissions standards or other terms or conditions of the permit.</P>
            <P>(iv) The Administrator or the permitting authority determines that the permit must be revised or revoked to assure compliance with the applicable requirements.</P>
            <P>(2) Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and shall affect only those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists. Such reopening shall be made as expeditiously as practicable.</P>
            <P>(3) Reopenings under paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not be initiated before a notice of such intent is provided to the part 70 source by the permitting authority at least 30 days in advance of the date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the permitting authority may provide a shorter time period in the case of an emergency.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Reopenings for cause by EPA.</E> (1) If the Administrator finds that cause exists to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue a permit pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the Administrator will notify the permitting authority and the permittee of such finding in writing.</P>
            <P>(2) The permitting authority shall, within 90 days after receipt of such notification, forward to EPA a proposed determination of termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance, as appropriate. The Administrator may extend this 90-day period for an additional 90 days if he finds that a new or revised permit application is necessary or that the permitting authority must require the permittee to submit additional information.</P>
            <P>(3) The Administrator will review the proposed determination from the permitting authority within 90 days of receipt.</P>
            <P>(4) The permitting authority shall have 90 days from receipt of an EPA objection to resolve any objection that EPA makes and to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit in accordance with the Administrator's objection.</P>
            <P>(5) If the permitting authority fails to submit a proposed determination pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section or fails to resolve any objection pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the Administrator will terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit after taking the following actions:</P>
            <P>(i) Providing at least 30 days' notice to the permittee in writing of the reasons for any such action. This notice may be given during the procedures in paragraphs (g) (1) through (4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) Providing the permittee an opportunity for comment on the Administrator's proposed action and an opportunity for a hearing.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Public participation.</E> Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification procedures, all permit proceedings, including initial permit issuance, significant modifications, and renewals, shall provide adequate procedures for public notice including offering an opportunity for public comment and a hearing on the draft permit. These procedures shall include the following:</P>

            <P>(1) Notice shall be given by one of the following methods: By publishing the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the source is located (or in a State publication designed to give general public notice) or by posting the notice, for the duration of the public comment period, on a public Web site identified by the permitting authority, if the permitting authority has selected Web site noticing as its “consistent noticing method.” The consistent noticing method shall be used for all draft permits subject to notice under this paragraph. If Web site noticing is selected as the consistent noticing method, the draft permit shall also be posted, for the duration of the public comment period, on a public Web site identified by the permitting authority. In addition, notice shall be given to persons on a mailing list developed by the permitting authority using generally accepted methods (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> hyperlink sign-up function or radio button on an agency Web site, sign-up sheet at a public hearing, etc.) that enable interested parties to subscribe to the mailing list. The permitting authority may update <PRTPAGE P="254"/>the mailing list from time to time by requesting written indication of continued interest from those listed. The permitting authority may delete from the list the name of any person who fails to respond to such a request within a reasonable timeframe. The permitting authority may use other means to provide adequate notice to the affected public;</P>
            <P>(2) The notice shall identify the affected facility; the name and address of the permittee; the name and address of the permitting authority processing the permit; the activity or activities involved in the permit action; the emissions change involved in any permit modification; the name, address, and telephone number of a person (or an email or Web site address) from whom interested persons may obtain additional information, including copies of the permit draft, the application, all relevant supporting materials, including those set forth in § 70.4(b)(3)(viii) of this part, and all other materials available to the permitting authority (except for publicly-available materials and publications) that are relevant to the permit decision; a brief description of the comment procedures required by this part; and the time and place of any hearing that may be held, including a statement of procedures to request a hearing (unless a hearing has already been scheduled);</P>
            <P>(3) The permitting authority shall provide such notice and opportunity for participation by affected States as is provided for by § 70.8 of this part;</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Timing.</E> The permitting authority shall provide at least 30 days for public comment and shall give notice of any public hearing at least 30 days in advance of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(5) The permitting authority shall keep a record of the commenters and also of the issues raised during the public participation process so that the Administrator may fulfill his obligation under section 505(b)(2) of the Act to determine whether a citizen petition may be granted, and such records shall be available to the public.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Transmission of information to the Administrator.</E> (1) The permit program shall require that the permitting authority provide to the Administrator a copy of each permit application (including any application for permit modification), each proposed permit, and each final part 70 permit. The applicant may be required by the permitting authority to provide a copy of the permit application (including the compliance plan) directly to the Administrator. Upon agreement with the Administrator, the permitting authority may submit to the Administrator a permit application summary form and any relevant portion of the permit application and compliance plan, in place of the complete permit application and compliance plan. To the extent practicable, the preceding information shall be provided in computer-readable format compatible with EPA's national database management system.</P>
            <P>(2) The Administrator may waive the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section for any category of sources (including any class, type, or size within such category) other than major sources according to the following:</P>
            <P>(i) By regulation for a category of sources nationwide, or</P>
            <P>(ii) At the time of approval of a State program for a category of sources covered by an individual permitting program.</P>
            <P>(3) Each State permitting authority shall keep for 5 years such records and submit to the Administrator such information as the Administrator may reasonably require to ascertain whether the State program complies with the requirements of the Act or of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Review by affected States.</E> (1) The permit program shall provide that the permitting authority give notice of each draft permit to any affected State on or before the time that the permitting authority provides this notice to the public under § 70.7(h) of this part, except to the extent § 70.7(e) (2) or (3) of this part requires the timing of the notice to be different.</P>

            <P>(2) The permit program shall provide that the permitting authority, as part of the submittal of the proposed permit <PRTPAGE P="255"/>to the Administrator [or as soon as possible after the submittal for minor permit modification procedures allowed under § 70.7(e) (2) or (3) of this part], shall notify the Administrator and any affected State in writing of any refusal by the permitting authority to accept all recommendations for the proposed permit that the affected State submitted during the public or affected State review period. The notice shall include the permitting authority's reasons for not accepting any such recommendation. The permitting authority is not required to accept recommendations that are not based on applicable requirements or the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">EPA objection.</E> (1) The Administrator will object to the issuance of any proposed permit determined by the Administrator not to be in compliance with applicable requirements or requirements under this part. No permit for which an application must be transmitted to the Administrator under paragraph (a) of this section shall be issued if the Administrator objects to its issuance in writing within 45 days of receipt of the proposed permit and all necessary supporting information.</P>
            <P>(2) Any EPA objection under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall include a statement of the Administrator's reasons for objection and a description of the terms and conditions that the permit must include to respond to the objections. The Administrator will provide the permit applicant a copy of the objection.</P>
            <P>(3) Failure of the permitting authority to do any of the following also shall constitute grounds for an objection:</P>
            <P>(i) Comply with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) Submit any information necessary to review adequately the proposed permit; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Process the permit under the procedures approved to meet § 70.7(h) of this part except for minor permit modifications.</P>
            <P>(4) If the permitting authority fails, within 90 days after the date of an objection under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, to revise and submit a proposed permit in response to the objection, the Administrator will issue or deny the permit in accordance with the requirements of the Federal program promulgated under title V of this Act.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Public petitions to the Administrator.</E> The program shall provide that, if the Administrator does not object in writing under paragraph (c) of this section, any person may petition the Administrator within 60 days after the expiration of the Administrator's 45-day review period to make such objection. Any such petition shall be based only on objections to the permit that were raised with reasonable specificity during the public comment period provided for in § 70.7(h) of this part, unless the petitioner demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such period, or unless the grounds for such objection arose after such period. If the Administrator objects to the permit as a result of a petition filed under this paragraph, the permitting authority shall not issue the permit until EPA's objection has been resolved, except that a petition for review does not stay the effectiveness of a permit or its requirements if the permit was issued after the end of the 45-day review period and prior to an EPA objection. If the permitting authority has issued a permit prior to receipt of an EPA objection under this paragraph, the Administrator will modify, terminate, or revoke such permit, and shall do so consistent with the procedures in § 70.7(g) (4) or (5) (i) and (ii) of this part except in unusual circumstances, and the permitting authority may thereafter issue only a revised permit that satisfies EPA's objection. In any case, the source will not be in violation of the requirement to have submitted a timely and complete application.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Prohibition on default issuance.</E> Consistent with § 70.4(b)(3)(ix) of this part, for the purposes of Federal law and title V of the Act, no State program may provide that a part 70 permit (including a permit renewal or modification) will issue until affected States and EPA have had an opportunity to review the proposed permit as required under this section. When the program is submitted for EPA review, the State Attorney General or independent legal counsel shall certify that no applicable provision of State law requires that a part 70 permit or <PRTPAGE P="256"/>renewal be issued after a certain time if the permitting authority has failed to take action on the application (or includes any other similar provision providing for default issuance of a permit), unless EPA has waived such review for EPA and affected States.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fee determination and certification.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Fee requirement.</E> The State program shall require that the owners or operators of part 70 sources pay annual fees, or the equivalent over some other period, that are sufficient to cover the permit program costs and shall ensure that any fee required by this section will be used solely for permit program costs.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fee schedule adequacy.</E> (1) The State program shall establish a fee schedule that results in the collection and retention of revenues sufficient to cover the permit program costs. These costs include, but are not limited to, the costs of the following activities as they relate to the operating permit program for stationary sources:</P>
            <P>(i) Preparing generally applicable regulations or guidance regarding the permit program or its implementation or enforcement;</P>
            <P>(ii) Reviewing and acting on any application for a permit, permit revision, or permit renewal, including the development of an applicable requirement as part of the processing of a permit, or permit revision or renewal;</P>
            <P>(iii) General administrative costs of running the permit program, including the supporting and tracking of permit applications, compliance certification, and related data entry;</P>
            <P>(iv) Implementing and enforcing the terms of any part 70 permit (not including any court costs or other costs associated with an enforcement action), including adequate resources to determine which sources are subject to the program;</P>
            <P>(v) Emissions and ambient monitoring;</P>
            <P>(vi) Modeling, analyses, or demonstrations;</P>
            <P>(vii) Preparing inventories and tracking emissions; and</P>
            <P>(viii) Providing direct and indirect support to sources under the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program contained in section 507 of the Act in determining and meeting their obligations under this part.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) The Administrator will presume that the fee schedule meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it would result in the collection and retention of an amount not less than $25 per year [as adjusted pursuant to the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section] times the total tons of the actual emissions of each regulated pollutant (for presumptive fee calculation) emitted from part 70 sources and any GHG cost adjustment required under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) The State may exclude from such calculation:</P>
            <P>(A) The actual emissions of sources for which no fee is required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section;</P>
            <P>(B) The amount of a part 70 source's actual emissions of each regulated pollutant (for presumptive fee calculation) that the source emits in excess of four thousand (4,000) tpy;</P>
            <P>(C) A part 70 source's actual emissions of any regulated pollutant (for presumptive fee calculation), the emissions of which are already included in the minimum fees calculation; or</P>
            <P>(D) The insignificant quantities of actual emissions not required in a permit application pursuant to § 70.5(c).</P>
            <P>(iii) “Actual emissions” means the actual rate of emissions in tons per year of any regulated pollutant (for presumptive fee calculation) emitted from a part 70 source over the preceding calendar year or any other period determined by the permitting authority to be representative of normal source operation and consistent with the fee schedule approved pursuant to this section. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and in-place control equipment, types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the preceding calendar year or such other time period established by the permitting authority pursuant to the preceding sentence.</P>

            <P>(iv) The program shall provide that the $25 per ton per year used to calculate the presumptive minimum amount to be collected by the fee <PRTPAGE P="257"/>schedule, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, shall be increased each year by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the most recent calendar year ending before the beginning of such year exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 1989.</P>
            <P>(A) The Consumer Price Index for any calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor, as of the close of the 12-month period ending on August 31 of each calendar year.</P>
            <P>(B) The revision of the Consumer Price Index which is most consistent with the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 1989 shall be used.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">GHG cost adjustment.</E> The amount calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be increased by the GHG cost adjustment determined as follows: For each activity identified in the following table, multiply the number of activities performed by the permitting authority by the burden hours per activity, and then calculate a total number of burden hours for all activities. Next, multiply the burden hours by the average cost of staff time, including wages, employee benefits and overhead.</P>

            <P>(5) The State shall provide a detailed accounting that its fee schedule meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if:</P>
            <P>(i) The State sets a fee schedule that would result in the collection and retention of an amount less than that presumed to be adequate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The Administrator determines, based on comments rebutting the presumption in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or on his own initiative, that there are serious questions regarding whether the fee schedule is sufficient to cover the permit program costs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee demonstration.</E> The permitting authority shall provide a demonstration that the fee schedule selected will result in the collection and retention of fees in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of Required Fee Revenue.</E> The Administrator will not approve a demonstration as meeting the requirements of this section, unless it contains an initial accounting (and periodic updates as required by the Administrator) of how required fee revenues are used solely to cover the costs of meeting the various functions of the permitting program.</P>

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Transition plan for initial permits issuance.</E> If a full or partial part 71 program becomes effective in a State or within Indian country prior to the issuance of part 70 permits to all part 70 sources under an existing program that has been approved under part 70 of this chapter, the Administrator shall take final action on initial permit applications for all part 71 sources in accordance with the following transition plan.</P>
              <P>(1) All part 71 sources that have not received part 70 permits shall submit permit applications under this part within 1 year after the effective date of the part 71 program.</P>
              <P>(2) Final action shall be taken on at least one-third of such applications annually over a period not to exceed 3 years after such effective date.</P>
              <P>(3) Any complete permit application containing an early reduction demonstration under section 112(i)(5) of the Act shall be acted on within 12 months of receipt of the complete application.</P>
              <P>(4) Submittal of permit applications and the permitting of affected sources shall occur in accordance with the deadlines in title IV of the Act and 40 CFR parts 72 through 78.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Delegation of part 71 program.</E> The Administrator may promulgate a part 71 program in a State or Indian country and delegate part of the responsibility for administering the part 71 program to the State or eligible Tribe in accordance with the provisions of § 71.10; however, delegation of a part of <PRTPAGE P="289"/>a part 71 program will not constitute any type of approval of a State or Tribal operating permits program under part 70 of this chapter. Where only selected portions of a part 71 program are administered by the Administrator and the State or eligible Tribe is delegated the remaining portions of the program, the Delegation Agreement referred to in § 71.10 will define the respective roles of the State or eligible Tribe and the Administrator in administering and enforcing the part 71 operating permits program.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">EPA administration and enforcement of part 70 permits.</E> When the Administrator administers and enforces a part 71 program after a determination and notice under § 70.10(b)(1) of this chapter that a State or Tribe is not adequately administering and enforcing an operating permits program approved under part 70 of this chapter, the Administrator will administer and enforce permits issued under the part 70 program until part 71 permits are issued using the procedures of part 71. Until such time as part 70 permits are replaced by part 71 permits, the Administrator will revise, reopen, revise, terminate, or revoke and reissue part 70 permits using the procedures of part 71 and will assess and collect fees in accordance with the provisions of § 71.9.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Transition to approved part 70 program.</E> The Administrator will suspend the issuance of part 71 permits promptly upon publication of notice of approval of a State or Tribal operating permits program that meets the requirements of part 70 of this chapter. The Administrator may retain jurisdiction over the part 71 permits for which the administrative or judicial review process is not complete and will address this issue in the notice of State program approval. After approval of a State or Tribal program and the suspension of issuance of part 71 permits by the Administrator:</P>
              <P>(1) The Administrator, or the permitting authority acting as the Administrator's delegated agent, will continue to administer and enforce part 71 permits until they are replaced by permits issued under the approved part 70 program. Until such time as part 71 permits are replaced by part 70 permits, the Administrator will revise, reopen, revise, terminate, or revoke and reissue part 71 permits using the procedures of the part 71 program. However, if the Administrator has delegated authority to administer part 71 permits to a delegate agency, the delegate agency will revise, reopen, terminate, or revoke and reissue part 71 permits using the procedures of the approved part 70 program. If a part 71 permit expires prior to the issuance of a part 70 permit, all terms and conditions of the part 71 permit, including any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 71.6(f), shall remain in effect until the part 70 permit is issued or denied, provided that a timely and complete application for a permit renewal was submitted to the permitting authority in accordance with the requirements of the approved part 70 program.</P>
              <P>(2) A State or local agency or Indian Tribe with an approved part 70 operating permits program may issue part 70 permits for all sources with part 71 permits in accordance with a permit issuance schedule approved as part of the approved part 70 program or may issue part 70 permits to such sources at the expiration of the part 71 permits.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Exemption for certain territories.</E> Upon petition by the Governor of Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, the Administrator may exempt any source or class of sources in such territory from the requirement to have a part 71 permit under this chapter. Such an exemption does not exempt such source or class of sources from any requirement of section 112 of the Act, including the requirements of section 112 (g) or (j).</P>
              <P>(1) Such exemption may be granted if the Administrator finds that compliance with part 71 is not feasible or is unreasonable due to unique geographical, meteorological, or economic factors of such territory, or such other local factors as the Administrator deems significant. Any such petition shall be considered in accordance with section 307(d) of the Act, and any exemption granted under this paragraph (m) shall be considered final action by the Administrator for the purposes of section 307(b) of the Act.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator shall promptly notify the Committees on Energy and <PRTPAGE P="290"/>Commerce and on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Environment and Public Works and on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate upon receipt of any petition under this paragraph (m) and of the approval or rejection of such petition and the basis for such action.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Retention of records.</E> The records for each draft, proposed, and final permit application, renewal, or modification shall be kept by the Administrator for a period of 5 years.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Duty to apply.</E> For each part 71 source, the owner or operator shall submit a timely and complete permit application in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Timely application.</E> (i) A timely application for a source which does not have an existing operating permit issued by a State under the State's approved part 70 program and is applying for a part 71 permit for the first time is one that is submitted within 12 months after the source becomes subject to the permit program or on or before such earlier date as the permitting authority may establish. Sources required to submit applications earlier than 12 months after the source becomes subject to the permit program will be notified of the earlier submittal date at least 6 months in advance of the date.</P>
              <P>(ii) Part 71 sources required to meet the requirements under section 112(g) of the Act, or to have a permit under the preconstruction review program approved into the applicable implementation plan under part C or D of title I of the Act, shall file a complete application to obtain the part 71 permit or permit revision within 12 months after commencing operation or on or before such earlier date as the permitting authority may establish. Sources required to submit applications earlier than 12 months after the source becomes subject to the permit program will be notified of the earlier submittal date at least 6 months in advance of the date. Where an existing part 70 or 71 permit would prohibit such construction or change in operation, the source must obtain a permit revision before commencing operation.</P>
              <P>(iii) For purposes of permit renewal, a timely application is one that is submitted at least 6 months but not more that 18 months prior to expiration of the part 70 or 71 permit.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Complete application.</E> To be deemed complete, an application must provide all information required pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, except that applications for permit revision need supply such information only if it is related to the proposed change. To be found complete, an initial or renewal application must remit payment of fees owed under the fee schedule established pursuant to § 71.9(b). Information required under paragraph (c) of this section must be sufficient to evaluate the subject source and its application and to determine all applicable requirements. A responsible official must certify the submitted information consistent with paragraph (d) of this section. Unless the permitting authority determines that an application is not complete within 60 days of receipt of the application, such application shall be deemed to be complete, except as otherwise provided in § 71.7(a)(4). If, while processing an application that has been determined or deemed to be complete, the permitting authority determines that additional information is necessary to evaluate or take final action on that application, it may request such information in writing and set a reasonable deadline for a response. The source's ability to operate without a permit, as set forth in § 71.7(b), shall be in effect from the date the application is determined or deemed to be complete until the final permit is issued, provided that the applicant submits any requested additional information by the deadline specified by the permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Confidential information.</E> An applicant may assert a business confidentiality claim for information requested <PRTPAGE P="291"/>by the permitting authority using procedures found at part 2, subpart B of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Duty to supplement or correct application.</E> Any applicant who fails to submit any relevant facts or who has submitted incorrect information in a permit application shall, upon becoming aware of such failure or incorrect submittal, promptly submit such supplementary facts or corrected information. In addition, an applicant shall provide additional information as necessary to address any requirements that become applicable to the source after the date it filed a complete application but prior to release of a draft permit.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Standard application form and required information.</E> The permitting authority shall provide sources a standard application form or forms. The permitting authority may use discretion in developing application forms that best meet program needs and administrative efficiency. The forms and attachments chosen, however, shall include the elements specified below. An application may not omit information needed to determine the applicability of, or to impose, any applicable requirement, or to evaluate the fee amount required under the schedule established pursuant to § 71.9.</P>

              <P>(C) A schedule of compliance for sources that are not in compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance. Such a schedule shall include a schedule of remedial measures, including an enforceable sequence of actions with milestones, leading to compliance with any applicable requirements for which the source will be in noncompliance at the time of permit issuance. This compliance schedule shall resemble and be at least as stringent as that contained in any judicial consent decree or administrative order to which the source is subject. Any such schedule of compliance shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with, the applicable requirements on which it is based.</P>
              <P>(D) For applicable requirements associated with a proposed AOS, a statement that the source will meet such requirements upon implementation of the AOS. If a proposed AOS would implicate an applicable requirement that will become effective during the permit term, a statement that the source will meet such requirements on a timely basis.

              </P>
              <P>(1) Emissions limitations and standards, including those operational requirements and limitations that assure compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance. Such requirements and limitations may include ARMs identified by the source in its part 71 permit application as approved by the permitting authority, provided that no ARM shall contravene any terms needed to comply with any otherwise applicable requirement or requirement of this part or circumvent any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of implementing the ARM.</P>
              <P>(i) The permit shall specify and reference the origin of and authority for each term or condition, and identify any difference in form as compared to the applicable requirement upon which the term or condition is based.</P>
              <P>(ii) The permit shall state that, where an applicable requirement of the Act is more stringent than an applicable requirement of 40 CFR parts 72 through 78, both provisions shall be incorporated into the permit and shall be enforceable by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(iii) If an applicable implementation plan allows a determination of an alternative emission limit at a part 71 source, equivalent to that contained in the plan, to be made in the permit issuance, renewal, or significant modification process, and the permitting authority elects to use such process, any permit containing such equivalency determination shall contain provisions to ensure that any resulting emissions limit has been demonstrated to be quantifiable, accountable, enforceable, and based on replicable procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Permit duration.</E> The permitting authority shall issue permits for a fixed term of 5 years in the case of affected sources, and for a term not to exceed 5 years in the case of all other sources.

              <P>(B) Retention of records of all required monitoring data and support information for a period of at least 5 years from the date of the monitoring sample, measurement, report, or application. Support information includes all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip-chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, and copies of all reports required by the permit.</P>
              <P>(iii) With respect to reporting, the permit shall incorporate all applicable reporting requirements and require the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Submittal of reports of any required monitoring at least every 6 months. All instances of deviations from permit requirements must be clearly identified in such reports. All required reports must be certified by a responsible official consistent with § 71.5(d).</P>
              <P>(B) Prompt reporting of deviations from permit requirements, including those attributable to upset conditions as defined in the permit, the probable cause of such deviations, and any corrective actions or preventive measures taken. Where the underlying applicable requirement contains a definition of prompt or otherwise specifies a time frame for reporting deviations, that definition or time frame shall govern. Where the underlying applicable requirement fails to address the time frame for reporting deviations, reports of deviations shall be submitted to the permitting authority based on the following schedule:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For emissions of a hazardous air pollutant or a toxic air pollutant (as identified in an applicable regulation) that continue for more than an hour in excess of permit requirements, the report must be made with 24 hours of the occurrence.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For emissions of any regulated air pollutant, excluding those listed in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, that continue for more than two hours in excess of permit requirements, the report must be made within 48 hours.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For all other deviations from permit requirements, the report shall be contained in the report submitted in accordance with the timeframe given in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A permit may contain a more stringent reporting requirement than required by paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>), (<E T="03">2</E>), or (<E T="03">3</E>).</P>

              <P>If any of the above conditions are met, the source must notify the permitting authority by telephone or facsimile based on the timetable listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(B) (<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">4</E>) of this section. A written notice, certified consistent with § 71.5(d), must be submitted within 10 working days of the occurrence. All deviations reported under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section must also be identified in the 6 month report required under paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, deviation means any situation in which an emissions unit fails to meet a permit term or condition. A deviation is not always a violation. A deviation can be determined by observation or through review of data obtained from any testing, monitoring, or recordkeeping established in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section. For a situation lasting more than 24 hours which constitutes a deviation, each 24 hour period is considered a separate deviation. Included in the meaning of deviation are any of the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A situation where emissions exceed an emission limitation or standard;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A situation where process or emissions control device parameter values indicate that an emission limitation or standard has not been met;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A situation in which observations or data collected demonstrates noncompliance with an emission limitation or standard or any work practice or operating condition required by the permit;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A situation in which an exceedance or an excursion, as defined in part 64 of this chapter, occurs.</P>

              <P>(4) A permit condition prohibiting emissions exceeding any allowances that the source lawfully holds under 40 CFR parts 72 through 78.<PRTPAGE P="296"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) No permit revision shall be required for increases in emissions that are authorized by allowances acquired pursuant to the acid rain program, provided that such increases do not require a permit revision under any other applicable requirement.</P>
              <P>(ii) No limit shall be placed on the number of allowances held by the source. The source may not, however, use allowances as a defense to noncompliance with any other applicable requirement.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any such allowance shall be accounted for according to the procedures established in regulations 40 CFR parts 72 through 78.</P>
              <P>(5) A severability clause to ensure the continued validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge to any portions of the permit.</P>
              <P>(6) Provisions stating the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The permittee must comply with all conditions of the part 71 permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application.</P>
              <P>(ii) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit.</P>
              <P>(iii) The permit may be modified, revoked, reopened, and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition.</P>
              <P>(iv) The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.</P>
              <P>(v) The permittee shall furnish to the permitting authority, within a reasonable time, any information that the permitting authority may request in writing to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing, or terminating the permit or to determine compliance with the permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the permitting authority copies of records required to be kept by the permit or, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, for information claimed to be confidential, the permittee may furnish such records directly to the Administrator along with a claim of confidentiality.</P>
              <P>(7) A provision to ensure that a part 71 source pays fees to the Administrator consistent with the fee schedule approved pursuant to § 71.9.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Emissions trading.</E> A provision stating that no permit revision shall be required, under any approved economic incentives, marketable permits, emissions trading and other similar programs or processes for changes that are provided for in the permit.</P>
              <P>(9) Terms and conditions for reasonably anticipated AOSs identified by the source in its application as approved by the permitting authority. Such terms and conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) Shall require the source, contemporaneously with making a change from one operating scenario to another, to record in a log at the permitted facility a record of the AOS under which it is operating;</P>
              <P>(ii) May extend the permit shield described in paragraph (f) of this section to all terms and conditions under each such AOS; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Must ensure that the terms and conditions of each AOS meet all applicable requirements and the requirements of this part. The permitting authority shall not approve a proposed AOS into the part 71 permit until the source has obtained all authorizations required under any applicable requirement relevant to that AOS.</P>
              <P>(10) Terms and conditions, if the permit applicant requests them, for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted facility, to the extent that the applicable requirements provide for trading such increases and decreases without a case-by-case approval of each emissions trade. Such terms and conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) Shall include all terms required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section to determine compliance;</P>

              <P>(ii) May extend the permit shield described in paragraph (f) of this section to all terms and conditions that allow <PRTPAGE P="297"/>such increases and decreases in emissions; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Must meet all applicable requirements and requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Permit expiration.</E> A provision to ensure that a part 71 permit expires upon the earlier occurrence of the following events:</P>
              <P>(i) twelve years elapses from the date of issuance to a solid waste incineration unit combusting municipal waste subject to standards under section 112(e) of the Act; or</P>
              <P>(ii) five years elapses from the date of issuance; or</P>
              <P>(iii) the source is issued a part 70 permit.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Off Permit Changes.</E> A provision allowing changes that are not addressed or prohibited by the permit, other than those subject to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 72 through 78 or those that are modifications under any provision of title I of the Act to be made without a permit revision, provided that the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(i) Each such change shall meet all applicable requirements and shall not violate any existing permit term or condition;</P>
              <P>(ii) Sources must provide contemporaneous written notice to the permitting authority (and EPA, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) of each such change, except for changes that qualify as insignificant under § 71.5(c)(11). Such written notice shall describe each such change, including the date, any change in emissions, pollutants emitted, and any applicable requirement that would apply as a result of the change;</P>
              <P>(iii) The change shall not qualify for the shield under § 71.6(f);</P>
              <P>(iv) The permittee shall keep a record describing changes made at the source that result in emissions of a regulated air pollutant subject to an applicable requirement, but not otherwise regulated under the permit, and the emissions resulting from those changes.</P>
              <P>(13) <E T="03">Operational flexibility.</E> Provisions consistent with paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section to allow changes within a permitted facility without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions): Provided, that the facility provides the Administrator (in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) and the permitting authority with written notification as required below in advance of the proposed changes, which shall be a minimum of 7 days.</P>
              <P>(i) The permit shall allow the permitted source to make section 502(b)(10) changes without requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act and the changes do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit (whether expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total emissions).</P>
              <P>(A) For each such change, the written notification required above shall include a brief description of the change within the permitted facility, the date on which the change will occur, any change in emissions, and any permit term or condition that is no longer applicable as a result of the change.</P>
              <P>(B) The permit shield described in § 71.6(f) shall not apply to any change made pursuant to this paragraph (a)(13)(i).</P>
              <P>(ii) The permit may provide for the permitted source to trade increases and decreases in emissions in the permitted facility, where the applicable implementation plan provides for such emissions trades without requiring a permit revision and based on the 7-day notice prescribed in this paragraph (a)(13)(ii) of this section. This provision is available in those cases where the permit does not already provide for such emissions trading.</P>

              <P>(A) Under this paragraph (a)(13)(ii), the written notification required above shall include such information as may be required by the provision in the applicable implementation plan authorizing the emissions trade, including at a minimum, when the proposed change will occur, a description of each such change, any change in emissions, the permit requirements with which the source will comply using the emissions <PRTPAGE P="298"/>trading provisions of the applicable implementation plan, and the pollutants emitted subject to the emissions trade. The notice shall also refer to the provisions with which the source will comply in the applicable implementation plan and that provide for the emissions trade.</P>
              <P>(B) The permit shield described in § 71.6(f) shall not extend to any change made under this paragraph (a)(13)(ii). Compliance with the permit requirements that the source will meet using the emissions trade shall be determined according to requirements of the applicable implementation plan authorizing the emissions trade.</P>
              <P>(iii) The permit shall require the permitting authority, if a permit applicant requests it, to issue permits that contain terms and conditions, including all terms required under § 71.6 (a) and (c) to determine compliance, allowing for the trading of emissions increases and decreases in the permitted facility solely for the purpose of complying with a federally-enforceable emissions cap that is established in the permit independent of otherwise applicable requirements. The permit applicant shall include in its application proposed replicable procedures and permit terms that ensure the emissions trades are quantifiable and enforceable. The permitting authority shall not be required to include in the emissions trading provisions any emissions units for which emissions are not quantifiable or for which there are no replicable procedures to enforce the emissions trades. The permit shall also require compliance with all applicable requirements.</P>
              <P>(A) Under this paragraph (a)(13)(iii), the written notification required above shall state when the change will occur and shall describe the changes in emissions that will result and how these increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the terms and conditions of the permit.</P>
              <P>(B) The permit shield described in § 71.6(f) may extend to terms and conditions that allow such increases and decreases in emissions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Federally-enforceable requirements.</E> All terms and conditions in a part 71 permit, including any provisions designed to limit a source's potential to emit, are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens under the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance requirements.</E> All part 71 permits shall contain the following elements with respect to compliance:</P>
              <P>(1) Consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, compliance certification, testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit. Any document (including reports) required by a part 71 permit shall contain a certification by a responsible official that meets the requirements of § 71.5(d).</P>
              <P>(2) Inspection and entry requirements that require that, upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the permittee shall allow the permitting authority or an authorized representative to perform the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Enter upon the permittee's premises where a part 71 source is located or emissions-related activity is conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of the permit;</P>
              <P>(ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit;</P>
              <P>(iii) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under the permit; and</P>
              <P>(iv) As authorized by the Act, sample or monitor at reasonable times substances or parameters for the purpose of assuring compliance with the permit or applicable requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) A schedule of compliance consistent with § 71.5(c)(8).</P>
              <P>(4) Progress reports consistent with an applicable schedule of compliance and § 71.5(c)(8) to be submitted at least semiannually, or at a more frequent period if specified in the applicable requirement or by the permitting authority. Such progress reports shall contain the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Dates for achieving the activities, milestones, or compliance required in the schedule of compliance, and dates when such activities, milestones or compliance were achieved; and</P>

              <P>(ii) An explanation of why any dates in the schedule of compliance were not <PRTPAGE P="299"/>or will not be met, and any preventive or corrective measures adopted.</P>
              <P>(5) Requirements for compliance certification with terms and conditions contained in the permit, including emission limitations, standards, or work practices. Permits shall include each of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The frequency (not less than annually or such more frequent periods as specified in the applicable requirement or by the permitting authority) of submissions of compliance certifications;</P>
              <P>(ii) In accordance with § 71.6(a)(3), a means for monitoring the compliance of the source with its emissions limitations, standards, and work practices;</P>
              <P>(iii) A requirement that the compliance certification include all of the following (provided that the identification of applicable information may cross-reference the permit or previous reports, as applicable):</P>
              <P>(A) The identification of each term or condition of the permit that is the basis of the certification;</P>
              <P>(B) The identification of the method(s) or other means used by the owner or operator for determining the compliance status with each term and condition during the certification period. Such methods and other means shall include, at a minimum, the methods and means required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If necessary, the owner or operator also shall identify any other material information that must be included in the certification to comply with section 113(c)(2) of the Act, which prohibits knowingly making a false certification or omitting material information;</P>
              <P>(C) The status of compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit for the period covered by the certification, including whether compliance during the period was continuous or intermittent. The certification shall be based on the method or means designated in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section. The certification shall identify each deviation and take it into account in the compliance certification; and</P>
              <P>(D) Such other facts as the permitting authority may require to determine the compliance status of the source.</P>
              <P>(iv) A requirement that all compliance certifications be submitted to the Administrator as well as to the permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(6) Such other provisions as the permitting authority may require.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">General permits.</E> (1) The permitting authority may, after notice and opportunity for public participation provided under § 71.11, issue a general permit covering numerous similar sources. Any general permit shall comply with all requirements applicable to other part 71 permits and shall identify criteria by which sources may qualify for the general permit. To sources that qualify, the permitting authority shall grant the conditions and terms of the general permit. Notwithstanding the shield provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, the source shall be subject to enforcement action for operation without a part 71 permit if the source is later determined not to qualify for the conditions and terms of the general permit. General permits shall not be authorized for affected sources under the acid rain program unless otherwise provided in 40 CFR parts 72 through 78.</P>
              <P>(2) Part 71 sources that would qualify for a general permit must apply to the permitting authority for coverage under the terms of the general permit or must apply for a part 71 permit consistent with § 71.5. The permitting authority may, in the general permit, provide for applications which deviate from the requirements of § 71.5, provided that such applications meet the requirements of title V of the Act, and include all information necessary to determine qualification for, and to assure compliance with, the general permit. Without repeating the public participation procedures required under § 71.11, the permitting authority may grant a source's request for authorization to operate under a general permit, but such a grant shall not be a final permit action for purposes of judicial review.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Temporary sources.</E> The permitting authority may issue a single permit authorizing emissions from similar operations by the same source owner or operator at multiple temporary locations. The operation must be temporary and involve at least one change of location during the term of the permit. No affected source shall be permitted as a temporary source. Permits <PRTPAGE P="300"/>for temporary sources shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Conditions that will assure compliance with all applicable requirements at all authorized locations;</P>
              <P>(2) Requirements that the owner or operator notify the permitting authority at least 10 days in advance of each change in location; and</P>
              <P>(3) Conditions that assure compliance with all other provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Permit shield.</E> (1) Except as provided in this part, the permitting authority may expressly include in a part 71 permit a provision stating that compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance with any applicable requirements as of the date of permit issuance, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) Such applicable requirements are included and are specifically identified in the permit; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The permitting authority, in acting on the permit application or revision, determines in writing that other requirements specifically identified are not applicable to the source, and the permit includes the determination or a concise summary thereof.</P>
              <P>(2) A part 71 permit that does not expressly state that a permit shield exists shall be presumed not to provide such a shield.</P>
              <P>(3) Nothing in this paragraph or in any part 71 permit shall alter or affect the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The provisions of section 303 of the Act (emergency orders), including the authority of the Administrator under that section;</P>
              <P>(ii) The liability of an owner or operator of a source for any violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance;</P>
              <P>(iii) The applicable requirements of the acid rain program, consistent with section 408(a) of the Act; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The ability of EPA to obtain information from a source pursuant to section 114 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Emergency provision</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> An “emergency” means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, which situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to exceed a technology-based emission limitation under the permit, due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of an emergency.</E> An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology-based emission limitations if the conditions of paragraph (g)(3) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(3) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be demonstrated through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:</P>
              <P>(i) An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the emergency;</P>
              <P>(ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;</P>
              <P>(iii) During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission standards, or other requirements in the permit; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The permittee submitted notice of the emergency to the permitting authority within 2 working days of the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to the emergency. This notice fulfills the requirement of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken.</P>
              <P>(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an emergency has the burden of proof.</P>
              <P>(5) This provision is in addition to any emergency or upset provision contained in any applicable requirement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Permit issuance, renewal, reopenings, and revisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Action on application.</E> (1) A permit, permit modification, or renewal may be issued only if all of the following conditions have been met:</P>
              <P>(i) The permitting authority has received a complete application for a permit, permit modification, or permit renewal, except that a complete application need not be received before issuance of a general permit under § 71.6(d);</P>
              <P>(ii) Except for modifications qualifying for minor permit modification procedures under paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, the permitting authority has complied with the requirements for public participation under this section or § 71.11, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(iii) The permitting authority has complied with the requirements for notifying and responding to affected States under § 71.8(a);</P>
              <P>(iv) The conditions of the permit provide for compliance with all applicable requirements and the requirements of this part; and</P>
              <P>(v) In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, the Administrator has received a copy of the proposed permit and any notices required under § 71.10(d) and has not objected to issuance of the permit under § 71.10(g) within the time period specified therein.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided under the initial transition plan provided for under § 71.4(i) or under 40 CFR part 72 or title V of the Act for the permitting of affected sources under the acid rain program, the permitting authority shall take final action on each permit application (including a request for permit modification or renewal) within 18 months after receiving a complete application.</P>
              <P>(3) The permitting authority shall ensure that priority is given to taking action on applications for construction or modification under title I, parts C and D of the Act.</P>
              <P>(4) The permitting authority shall promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless the permitting authority requests additional information or otherwise notifies the applicant of incompleteness within 60 days of receipt of an application, the application shall be deemed complete. For modifications processed through minor permit modification procedures, such as those in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, the permitting authority need not make a completeness determination.</P>
              <P>(5) The permitting authority shall provide a statement that sets forth the legal and factual basis for the draft permit conditions (including references to the applicable statutory or regulatory provisions). The permitting authority shall send this statement to any person who requests it, and to EPA, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10.</P>
              <P>(6) The submittal of a complete application shall not affect the requirement that any source have a preconstruction permit under title I of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirement for a permit.</E> Except as provided in the following sentence, § 71.6(a)(13), and paragraphs (e)(1)(v) and e(2)(v) of this section, no part 71 source may operate after the time that it is required to submit a timely and complete application under this part, except in compliance with a permit issued under this part. If a part 71 source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance (including for renewal), the source's failure to have a part 71 permit is not a violation of this part until the permitting authority takes final action on the permit application, except as noted in this section. This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and as required by § 71.5(c), the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the permitting authority any additional information identified as being needed to process the application.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Permit renewal and expiration.</E> (1) (i) Permits being renewed are subject to the same procedural requirements, including those for public participation, affected State review, and EPA review (in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) that apply to initial permit issuance.</P>

              <P>(ii) Permit expiration terminates the source's right to operate unless a timely and complete renewal application has been submitted consistent with <PRTPAGE P="302"/>paragraph (b) of this section and § 71.5(a)(1)(iii).</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, if the permitting authority fails to act in a timely way on permit renewal, EPA may invoke its authority under section 505(e) of the Act to terminate or revoke and reissue the permit.</P>
              <P>(3) If a timely and complete application for a permit renewal is submitted, consistent with § 71.5(a)(2), but the permitting authority has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit before the end of the term of the previous part 70 or 71 permit, then the permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has been issued or denied and any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 71.6(f) may extend beyond the original permit term until renewal; or all the terms and conditions of the permit including any permit shield that may be granted pursuant to § 71.6(f) shall remain in effect until the renewal permit has been issued or denied.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Administrative permit amendments.</E> (1) An “administrative permit amendment” is a permit revision that:</P>
              <P>(i) Corrects typographical errors;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source;</P>
              <P>(iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee;</P>
              <P>(iv) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of a source where the permitting authority determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the permitting authority;</P>
              <P>(v) Incorporates into the part 71 permit the requirements from preconstruction review permits authorized under an EPA-approved program, provided that such a program meets procedural requirements substantially equivalent to the requirements of §§ 71.7 and 71.8 (and § 71.10 in the case of a delegated program) that would be applicable to the change if it were subject to review as a permit modification, and compliance requirements substantially equivalent to those contained in § 71.6; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined to be similar to those in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Administrative permit amendments for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by 40 CFR part 72.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Administrative permit amendment procedures.</E> An administrative permit amendment may be made by the permitting authority consistent with the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The permitting authority shall take no more than 60 days from receipt of a request for an administrative permit amendment to take final action on such request, and may incorporate such changes without providing notice to the public or affected States provided that it designates any such permit revisions as having been made pursuant to this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(ii) The permitting authority shall submit a copy of the revised permit to the Administrator in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10.</P>
              <P>(iii) The source may implement the changes addressed in the request for an administrative amendment immediately upon submittal of the request.</P>
              <P>(4) The permitting authority may, upon taking final action granting a request for an administrative permit amendment, allow coverage by the permit shield in § 71.6(f) for administrative permit amendments made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section which meet the relevant requirements of §§ 71.6, 71.7, and 71.8 for significant permit modifications.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Permit modifications.</E> A permit modification is any revision to a part 71 permit that cannot be accomplished under the provisions for administrative permit amendments under paragraph (d) of this section. A permit modification for purposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by 40 CFR part 72.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Minor permit modification procedures.</E> (i) Criteria. (A) Minor permit modification procedures may be used only for those permit modifications that:<PRTPAGE P="303"/>

              <P>(v) <E T="03">Source's ability to make change.</E> The source may make the change proposed in its minor permit modification application immediately after it files such application. After the source makes the change allowed by the preceding sentence, and until the permitting authority takes any of the actions specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section, the source must comply with both the applicable requirements governing the change and the proposed permit terms and conditions. During this time period, the source need not comply with the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify. However, if the source fails to comply with its proposed permit terms and conditions during this time period, the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify may be enforced against it.</P>

Every significant change in existing monitoring permit terms or conditions and every relaxation of reporting or recordkeeping permit terms or conditions shall be considered significant. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the permittee from making changes consistent with this part that would render existing permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant.</P>
              <P>(ii) Significant permit modifications shall meet all requirements of this part, including those for applications, public participation, review by affected States, and review by EPA (in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10), as they apply to permit issuance and permit renewal. The permitting authority shall design and implement this review process to complete review on the majority of significant permit modifications within 9 months after receipt of a complete application.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reopening for cause.</E> (1) Each issued permit shall include provisions specifying the conditions under which the permit will be reopened prior to the expiration of the permit. A permit shall be reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) Additional applicable requirements under the Act become applicable to a major part 71 source with a remaining permit term of 3 or more years. Such a reopening shall be completed not later than 18 months after promulgation of the applicable requirement. No such reopening is required if the effective date of the requirement is later than the date on which the permit is due to expire, unless the original permit or any of its terms and conditions have been extended pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Additional requirements (including excess emissions requirements) become applicable to an affected source under the acid rain program. Upon approval by the Administrator, excess emissions offset plans shall be deemed to be incorporated into the permit.</P>
              <P>(iii) The permitting authority (or EPA, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) determines that the permit contains a material mistake or that inaccurate statements were made in establishing the emissions standards or other terms or conditions of the permit.</P>
              <P>(iv) The permitting authority (or EPA, in the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10) determines that the permit must be revised or revoked to assure compliance with the applicable requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and shall affect only those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists, and shall be made as expeditiously as practicable.</P>
              <P>(3) Reopenings under paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not be initiated before a notice of such intent is provided to the part 71 source by the permitting authority at least 30 days in advance of the date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the permitting authority may provide a shorter time period in the case of an emergency.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reopenings for cause by EPA for delegated programs.</E> (1) In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, if the Administrator finds that cause exists to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue a permit pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the Administrator will notify the permitting authority and the permittee of such finding in writing.</P>

              <P>(2) The permitting authority shall, within 90 days after receipt of such notification, forward to EPA a proposed determination of termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance, as appropriate. The Administrator may extend this 90-day period for an additional 90 days if he or she finds that a new or revised permit application is <PRTPAGE P="306"/>necessary or that the permitting authority must require the permittee to submit additional information.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator will review the proposed determination from the permitting authority within 90 days of receipt.</P>
              <P>(4) The permitting authority shall have 90 days from receipt of an EPA objection to resolve any objection that EPA makes and to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit in accordance with the Administrator's objection.</P>
              <P>(5) If the permitting authority fails to submit a proposed determination pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section or fails to resolve any objection pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the Administrator will terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit after taking the following actions:</P>
              <P>(i) Providing at least 30 days' notice to the permittee in writing of the reasons for any such action. This notice may be given during the procedures in paragraphs (g) (1) through (4) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Delegation of part 71 program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Delegation of part 71 program.</E> The Administrator may delegate, in whole or in part, with or without signature authority, the authority to administer a part 71 operating permits program to a State, eligible Tribe, local, or other non-State agency in accordance with the provisions of this section. In order to be delegated authority to administer a part 71 program, the delegate agency must submit a legal opinion from the Attorney General from the State, or the attorney for the State, local, interstate, or eligible Tribal agency that has independent legal counsel, stating that the laws of the State, locality, interstate compact or Indian Tribe provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the delegated program. A Delegation of Authority Agreement (Agreement) shall set forth the terms and conditions of the delegation, shall specify the provisions that the delegate agency shall be authorized to implement, and shall be entered into by the Administrator and the delegate agency. The Agreement shall become effective upon the date that both the Administrator and the delegate agency have signed the Agreement. Once delegation becomes effective, the delegate agency will be responsible, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for administering the part 71 program for the area subject to the Agreement. Delegate agencies that choose to receive electronic documents as part of their delegated program must satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Publication of Notice of Delegation of Authority Agreement.</E> The Administrator shall publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> informing the public of any delegation of a portion of the part 71 program to a State, eligible Tribe, or local agency.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Revision or revocation of Delegation of Authority Agreement.</E> An Agreement may be modified, amended, or revoked, in part or in whole, by the Administrator after consultation with the delegate agency.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transmission of information to the Administrator.</E> (1) When a part 71 program has been delegated in accordance with the provisions of this section, the delegate agency shall provide to the Administrator a copy of each permit application (including any application for permit modification), each proposed permit, and each final part 71 permit. The applicant may be required by the delegate agency to provide a copy of the permit application (including the compliance plan) directly to the Administrator. Upon agreement with the Administrator, the delegate agency may submit to the Administrator a permit application summary form and any relevant portion of the permit application and compliance plan, in place of the complete permit application and compliance plan. To the extent practicable, the preceding information shall be provided in computer-readable format compatible with EPA's national database management system.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may waive the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section for any category of sources (including any class, type, or size within such category) other than major sources by regulation for a category of sources nationwide.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Retention of records.</E> The records for each draft, proposed, and final permit, and application for permit renewal or modification shall be kept for a period of 5 years by the delegate agency. The delegate agency shall also submit to the Administrator such information as the Administrator may reasonably require to ascertain whether the delegate agency is implementing, administering, and enforcing the delegated part 71 program in compliance with the requirements of the Act and of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Prohibition of default issuance.</E> (1) For the purposes of Federal law and title V of the Act, when a part 71 program has been delegated in accordance with the provisions of this section, no part 71 permit (including a permit renewal or modification) will be issued until affected States have had an opportunity to review the draft permit as required pursuant to § 71.8(a) and EPA has had an opportunity to review the proposed permit.</P>

              <P>(2) To receive delegation of signature authority, the legal opinion submitted by the delegate agency pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall certify that no applicable provision of State, local or Tribal law requires that <PRTPAGE P="312"/>a part 71 permit or renewal be issued after a certain time if the delegate agency has failed to take action on the application (or includes any other similar provision providing for default issuance of a permit), unless EPA has waived such review for EPA and affected States.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">EPA objection.</E> (1) The Administrator will object to the issuance of any proposed permit determined by the Administrator not to be in compliance with applicable requirements or requirements under this part. No permit for which an application must be transmitted to the Administrator under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be issued if the Administrator objects to its issuance in writing within 45 days of receipt of the proposed permit and all necessary supporting information. When a part 71 program has been delegated in accordance with the provisions of this section, failure of the delegate agency to do any of the following shall constitute grounds for an objection by the Administrator:</P>
              <P>(i) Comply with paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Submit any information necessary to review adequately the proposed permit;</P>
              <P>(iii) Process the permit under the procedures required by §§ 71.7 and 71.11; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Comply with the requirements of § 71.8(a).</P>
              <P>(2) Any EPA objection under paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall include a statement of the Administrator's reason(s) for objection and a description of the terms and conditions that the permit must include to respond to the objection. The Administrator will provide the permit applicant a copy of the objection.</P>
              <P>(3) If the delegate agency fails, within 90 days after the date of an objection under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, to revise and submit to the Administrator the proposed permit in response to the objection, the Administrator shall issue or deny the permit in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Public petitions.</E> In the case of a delegated program, any interested person may petition the Administrator to reopen a permit for cause as provided in § 71.11(n).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal of permits.</E> When a part 71 program has been delegated with signature authority in accordance with the provisions of this section, any person or affected State that submitted recommendations or comments on the draft permit, or that participated in the public hearing process may petition the Environmental Appeals Board in accordance with § 71.11(l)(1).</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Nondelegable conditions.</E> (1) The Administrator's authority to object to the issuance of a part 71 permit cannot be delegated to an agency not within EPA.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator's authority to act upon petitions submitted pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section cannot be delegated to an agency not within EPA.</P>

              <P>(iv) All documents cited in the statement of basis; and</P>
              <P>(v) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the draft permit.</P>
              <P>(3) Material readily available at the permitting authority or published material that is generally available, and that is included in the administrative record under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section need not be physically included with the rest of the record as long as it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Public notice of permit actions and public comment period</E>—(1) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (i) The permitting authority shall give public notice that the following actions have occurred:</P>

The permitting authority may update the mailing list from time to time by requesting written indication of continued interest from those listed. The permitting authority may delete from the list the name of any person who fails to respond to such a request within a reasonable timeframe.</P>

              <P>(D) A brief description of the nature and purpose of the hearing, including the applicable rules and the comment procedures.</P>
              <P>(5) All persons identified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of this section shall be mailed a copy of the public hearing notice described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Public comments and requests for public hearings.</E> During the public comment period provided under paragraph (a) of this section, any interested person may submit written comments on the draft permit and may request a public hearing, if no hearing has already been scheduled. A request for a public hearing shall be in writing and <PRTPAGE P="315"/>shall state the nature of the issues proposed to be raised at the hearing. All comments shall be considered in making the final decision and shall be answered as provided in paragraph (j) of this section. The permitting authority will keep a record of the commenters and of the issues raised during the public participation process, and such records shall be available to the public.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Public hearings.</E> (1) The permitting authority shall hold a hearing whenever it finds, on the basis of requests, a significant degree of public interest in a draft permit.</P>
              <P>(2) The permitting authority may also hold a public hearing at its discretion, whenever, for instance, such a hearing might clarify one or more issues involved in the permit decision.</P>
              <P>(3) Public notice of the hearing shall be given as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever a public hearing is held, the permitting authority shall designate a Presiding Officer for the hearing who shall be responsible for its scheduling and orderly conduct.</P>
              <P>(5) Any person may submit oral or written statements and data concerning the draft permit. Reasonable limits may be set upon the time allowed for oral statements, and the submission of statements in writing may be required. The public comment period under paragraph (d) of this section shall be automatically extended to the close of any public hearing under this section. The hearing officer may also extend the comment period by so stating at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(6) A tape recording or written transcript of the hearing shall be made available to the public.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Obligation to raise issues and provide information during the public comment period.</E> All persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the permitting authority's initial decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably ascertainable arguments supporting their position by the close of the public comment period (including any public hearing). Any supporting materials that are submitted shall be included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they are already part of the administrative record in the same proceeding, or consist of State or Federal statutes and regulations, EPA documents of general applicability, or other generally available reference materials. In the case of a program delegated pursuant to § 71.10, if requested by the Administrator, the permitting authority shall make supporting materials not already included in the administrative record available to EPA. The permitting authority may direct commenters to provide such materials directly to EPA. A comment period longer than 30 days may be necessary to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this section. Additional time shall be granted to the extent that a commenter who requests additional time demonstrates the need for such time.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reopening of the public comment period.</E> (1) The permitting authority may order the public comment period reopened if the procedures of paragraph (h) of this section could expedite the decision making process. When the public comment period is reopened under paragraph (h) of this section, all persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the permitting authority's initial decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must submit all reasonably available factual grounds supporting their position, including all supporting material, by a date not less than 30 days after public notice under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, set by the permitting authority. Thereafter, any person may file a written response to the material filed by any other person, by a date, not less than 20 days after the date set for filing of the material, set by the permitting authority.</P>

              <P>(2) Public notice of any comment period under this paragraph (h) shall identify the issues to which the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section shall apply.<PRTPAGE P="316"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) On its own motion or on the request of any person, the permitting authority may direct that the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall apply during the initial comment period where it reasonably appears that issuance of the permit will be contested and that applying the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section will substantially expedite the decision making process. The notice of the draft permit shall state whenever this has been done.</P>
              <P>(4) A comment period of longer than 30 days may be necessary in complicated proceedings to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this section. Commenters may request longer comment periods and they may be granted to the extent the permitting authority finds it necessary.</P>
              <P>(5) If any data, information, or arguments submitted during the public comment period appear to raise substantial new questions concerning a permit, the permitting authority may take one or more of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(i) Prepare a new draft permit, appropriately modified;</P>
              <P>(ii) Prepare a revised statement of basis, and reopen the comment period; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Reopen or extend the comment period to give interested persons an opportunity to comment on the information or arguments submitted.</P>
              <P>(6) Comments filed during the reopened comment period shall be limited to the substantial new questions that caused the reopening. The public notice shall define the scope of the reopening.</P>
              <P>(7) Public notice of any of the above actions shall be issued under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Issuance and effective date of permit.</E> (1) After the close of the public comment period on a draft permit, the permitting authority shall issue a final permit decision. The permitting authority shall notify the applicant and each person who has submitted written comments or requested notice of the final permit decision. This notice shall include reference to the procedures for appealing a decision on a permit. For the purposes of this section, a final permit decision means a final decision to issue, deny, revise, revoke and reissue, renew, or terminate a permit.</P>
              <P>(2) A final permit decision shall become effective 30 days after the service of notice of the decision, unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A later effective date is specified in the decision;</P>
              <P>(ii) Review is requested under paragraph (l) of this section (in which case the specific terms and conditions of the permit which are the subject of the request for review shall be stayed); or</P>
              <P>(iii) No comments requested a change in the draft permit, in which case the permit shall become effective immediately upon issuance.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Response to comments.</E> (1) At the time that any final permit decision is issued, the permitting authority shall issue a response to comments. This response shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Specify which provisions, if any, of the draft permit have been changed in the final permit decision, and the reasons for the change; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Briefly describe and respond to all significant comments on the draft permit raised during the public comment period, or during any hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) Any documents cited in the response to comments shall be included in the administrative record for the final permit decision as defined in paragraph (k) of this section. If new points are raised or new material supplied during the public comment period, the permitting authority may document its response to those matters by adding new materials to the administrative record.</P>
              <P>(3) The response to comments shall be available to the public.</P>
              <P>(4) The permitting authority will notify in writing any affected State of any refusal to accept recommendations for the permit that the State submitted during the public or affected State review period.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Administrative record for final permits.</E> (1) The permitting authority shall base final permit decisions on the administrative record defined in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The administrative record for any final permit shall consist of:</P>

              <P>(i) All comments received during any public comment period, including any extension or reopening;<PRTPAGE P="317"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The tape or transcript of any hearing(s) held;</P>
              <P>(iii) Any written material submitted at such a hearing;</P>
              <P>(iv) The response to comments and any new materials placed in the record;</P>
              <P>(v) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the permit;</P>
              <P>(vi) The final permit;</P>
              <P>(vii) The application and any supporting data furnished by the applicant;</P>
              <P>(viii) The draft permit or notice of intent to deny the application or to terminate the permit;</P>
              <P>(ix) The statement of basis for the draft permit;</P>
              <P>(x) All documents cited in the statement of basis;</P>
              <P>(xi) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the draft permit.</P>
              <P>(3) The additional documents required under paragraph (k)(2) of this section should be added to the record as soon as possible after their receipt or publication by the permitting authority. The record shall be complete on the date the final permit is issued.</P>
              <P>(4) Material readily available at the permitting authority, or published materials which are generally available and which are included in the administrative record under the standards of paragraph (j) of this section need not be physically included in the same file as the rest of the record as long as it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis or in the response to comments.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Appeal of permits.</E> (1) Within 30 days after a final permit decision has been issued, any person who filed comments on the draft permit or participated in the public hearing may petition the Environmental Appeals Board to review any condition of the permit decision. Any person who failed to file comments or failed to participate in the public hearing on the draft permit may petition for administrative review only to the extent of the changes from the draft to the final permit decision or other new grounds that were not reasonably foreseeable during the public comment period on the draft permit. The 30-day period within which a person may request review under this section begins with the service of notice of the permitting authority's action unless a later date is specified in that notice, except that the 30-day period within which a person may request review of a minor permit modification or administrative amendment begins upon the effective date of such action to revise the permit. The petition shall include a statement of the reasons supporting that review, including a demonstration that any issues raised were raised during the public comment period (including any public hearing) to the extent required by these regulations unless the petitioner demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such period or unless the grounds for such objection arose after such period, and, when appropriate, a showing that the condition in question is based on:</P>
              <P>(i) A finding of fact or conclusion of law which is clearly erroneous; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An exercise of discretion or an important policy consideration which the Environmental Appeals Board should, in its discretion, review.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board may also decide on its initiative to review any condition of any permit issued under this part. The Board must act under paragraph (l) of this section within 30 days of the service date of notice of the permitting authority's action.</P>
              <P>(3) Within a reasonable time following the filing of the petition for review, the Board shall issue an order either granting or denying the petition for review. To the extent review is denied, the conditions of the final permit decision become final agency action. Public notice of any grant of review by the Board under paragraph (l)(1) or (2) of this section shall be given as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Public notice shall set forth a briefing schedule for the appeal and shall state that any interested person may file an amicus brief. Notice of denial of review shall be sent only to the permit applicant and to the person(s) requesting review.</P>
              <P>(4) A petition to the Board under paragraph (l)(1) of this section is, under 42 U.S.C. 307(b), a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of the final agency action.</P>

              <P>(5) For purposes of judicial review, final agency action occurs when a final <PRTPAGE P="318"/>permit is issued or denied by the permitting authority and agency review procedures are exhausted. A final permit decision shall be issued by the permitting authority:</P>
              <P>(i) When the Board issues notice to the parties that review has been denied;</P>
              <P>(ii) When the Board issues a decision on the merits of the appeal and the decision does not include a remand of the proceedings; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Upon the completion of remand proceedings if the proceedings are remanded, unless the Board's remand order specifically provides that appeal of the remand decision will be required to exhaust administrative remedies.</P>
              <P>(6) Motions to reconsider a final order shall be filed within ten (10) days after service of the final order. Every such motion must set forth the matters claimed to have been erroneously decided and the nature of the alleged errors. Motions for reconsideration under this provision shall be directed to, and decided by, the Board. Motions for reconsideration directed to the Administrator, rather than to the Board, will not be considered, except in cases that the Board has referred to the Administrator and in which the Administrator has issued the final order. A motion for reconsideration shall not stay the effective date of the final order unless specifically so ordered by the Board.</P>

              <P>(7) Notice of any final agency action regarding a Federal operating permit shall promptly be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Computation of time.</E> (1) Any time period scheduled to begin on the occurrence of an act or event shall begin on the day after the act or event.</P>
              <P>(2) Any time period scheduled to begin before the occurrence of an act or event shall be computed so that the period ends on the day before the act or event, except as otherwise provided.</P>
              <P>(3) If the final day of any time period falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the time period shall be extended to the next working day.</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever a party or interested person has the right or is required to act within a prescribed period after the service of notice or other paper upon him or her by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed time.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Public petitions to the Permitting Authority.</E> (1) Any interested person (including the permittee) may petition the permitting authority to reopen a permit for cause, and the permitting authority may commence a permit reopening on its own initiative. However, the permitting authority shall not revise, revoke and reissue, or terminate a permit except for the reasons specified in § 71.7(f)(1) or § 71.6(a)(6)(i). All requests shall be in writing and shall contain facts or reasons supporting the request.</P>
              <P>(2) If the permitting authority decides the request is not justified, it shall send the requester a brief written response giving a reason for the decision. Denials of requests for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination are not subject to public notice, comment, or hearings. Denials by the permitting authority may be informally appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board by a letter briefly setting forth the relevant facts. The Board may direct the permitting authority to begin revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination proceedings under paragraph (n)(3) of this section. The appeal shall be considered denied if the Board takes no action within 60 days after receiving it. This informal appeal is, under 42 U.S.C. 307, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of EPA action in denying a request for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination.</P>
              <P>(3) If the permitting authority decides the request is justified and that cause exists to revise, revoke and reissue or terminate a permit, it shall initiate proceedings to reopen the permit pursuant to § 71.7(f) or § 71.7(g).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Program overview.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The regulations in this subpart provide for a limited, Federal, title V, permit program to establish alternative emission limitations for early reductions sources that have demonstrated qualifying reductions of hazardous air pollutants under section 112(i)(5) of the Act. A permit issued under this subpart which establishes such an enforceable alternative emission limitation shall grant all emissions units in the early reductions source a six-year extension from otherwise applicable dates of compliance for standards promulgated under section 112(d) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) After approval of a State's comprehensive permit program pursuant to title V of the Act, the Administrator may continue to issue specialty permits under this subpart only under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) The early reductions source filed a permit application under this subpart before the State obtained approval of a comprehensive title V permit program but the permit had not been finally issued at the time of State program approval; or</P>
              <P>(2) The early reductions source will be required to file an early reductions permit application under § 71.24(b) before a comprehensive permit application is required by the State under the approved program.</P>
              <P>(c) When a circumstance described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section occurs, the primary consideration in the Administrator's decision to issue a specialty permit is the degree of delay anticipated by deferring to the State for permit issuance.</P>
              <P>(d) A Permit issued to an early reductions source under this subpart shall have a term not to exceed five years. Such a specialty permit shall be incorporated into a comprehensive title V permit subsequently issued to the facility containing the early reductions source, without reopening or revision of the specialty permit except as provided in § 71.26(e).</P>
              <P>(e) Issuance of a specialty permit under this subpart does not relieve a source from an obligation to file a timely and complete comprehensive permit application as required under an approved comprehensive title V permit program.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Delegation to other permitting authorities.</E> (1) The Administrator may delegate to another permitting authority the responsibility to implement this permit program. Under such a delegation, the Administrator reserves the right to issue a final permit to early reductions sources that filed permit applications with the Administrator prior to the permitting authority obtaining delegation.</P>
              <P>(2) Under any delegation, the Administrator will require that the permitting authority have enforcement authority substantially equivalent to that specified in § 70.11 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon any delegation, administrative appeals of permit decisions issuing pursuant to the delegated program shall continue to be subject to the requirements of § 71.27(l).</P>

              <P>(7) Provisions stating the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The permittee must comply with all conditions of part 71 permit issued under this subpart. A violation of an alternative emission limitation, as well as any other requirement established in a permit issued under this subpart, is enforceable pursuant to the authority of section 113 of the Act, notwithstanding any demonstration of continuing 90 percent (95 percent in the case of hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) emission reduction over the entire early reductions source. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Act and is grounds for enforcement action or for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification;</P>
              <P>(ii) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit;</P>
              <P>(iii) The permit may be revised, revoked, reopened, and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition;</P>
              <P>(iv) The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege; and</P>

              <P>(v) The permittee shall furnish to the Administrator, within a reasonable time, any information that the Administrator may request in writing to determine whether cause exists for revising the permit, revoking and reissuing, or terminating the permit or to determine compliance with the permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the Administrator copies of <PRTPAGE P="324"/>records required to be kept by the permitee.</P>
              <P>(8) Terms and conditions for reasonably anticipated operating scenarios identified by the early reductions source in its application as approved by the Administrator. Such terms and conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) Shall require the early reductions source, contemporaneously with making a change from one operating scenario to another, to record in a log at the permitted facility a record of the scenario under which it is operating. Provided that an emitting unit is monitored in a way that provides contemporaneous identification that a change to a particular alternate scenario has occurred, no notice to the Administrator is required. Otherwise, when such a change is made, the permittee at the beginning of the following week shall place in regular mail to the Administrator notice that a change to a particular alternate operating scenario has occurred; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Must ensure that the terms and conditions of each such alternative scenario meet the alternative emission limitation and the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(9) Terms and conditions, if the permit applicant requests them, for the trading of hazardous air pollutant emissions increases and decreases among emissions units within the early reductions source without permit revision or case-by-case approval of each emissions trade, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) Such terms and conditions include all terms required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section to determine compliance;</P>
              <P>(ii) The changes in hazardous air pollutant emissions do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit;</P>
              <P>(iii) The changes in hazardous air pollutant emissions are not modifications under any provision of title I of the Act;</P>
              <P>(iv) The Administrator determines that the emissions are quantifiable and that replicable procedures or other practical means exist to enforce the emission trades; and</P>
              <P>(v) The early reductions source owner or operator provides the Administrator written notification at least 7 days in advance of the proposed changes and includes in the notification a description of the change in emissions that will occur, when the change will occur, and how the increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the alternative emission limitation and other terms and conditions of the permit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Federally enforceable requirements.</E> All terms and conditions in a permit issued under this subpart are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens under the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance requirements.</E> All permits issued under this subpart shall contain the following elements with respect to compliance:</P>
              <P>(1) Consistent with paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit.

              <P>(2) Inspection and entry provisions that require that, upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the permittee shall allow the Administrator or an authorized representative to perform the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Enter upon the permittee's premises where the early reductions source is located or emissions-related activity is conducted, or where required records are kept;</P>
              <P>(ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit;</P>
              <P>(iii) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and air pollution control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under the permit; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Sample or monitor at reasonable times substances or parameters for the purpose of determining compliance with the permit.</P>

              <P>(3) Requirements for compliance certification with terms and conditions contained in the permit, including the alternative emission limitation. Permits shall include each of the following:<PRTPAGE P="325"/>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Permit shield.</E> (1) The Administrator will expressly include in a permit issued pursuant to this subpart a provision stating that compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance with part 63, subpart D, of this chapter (the Early Reductions Rule), as of the date of permit issuance.</P>
              <P>(2) A permit shield may be extended to all permit terms and conditions for alternate operating scenarios pursuant to paragraph (a)(9) of this section or that allow increases and decreases in hazardous air pollutant emissions pursuant to paragraph (a)(10) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Nothing in this paragraph (d) or in any permit issued pursuant to this subpart shall alter or affect the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The provisions of sections 112(r) and 303 of the Act (emergency orders);</P>
              <P>(ii) The liability of an owner or operator of an early reductions source for any violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The ability of the Administrator to obtain information from an early reductions source pursuant to section 114 of the Act.</P>

An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of an emergency.</E> An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such an emission limitation if the conditions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(3) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be demonstrated through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:</P>
              <P>(i) An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the emergency;</P>
              <P>(ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;</P>
              <P>(iii) During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission limitation, or other requirements in the permit; and</P>

              <P>(iv) The permittee submitted notice of the emergency to the Administrator within 2 working days of the time when emission limitations were exceeded due to the emergency. This notice fulfills the requirement of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section. This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions taken.<PRTPAGE P="326"/>

              <P>(2) The Administrator will take final action on each permit application (including a request for permit revision) within 12 months after receiving a complete application, except that final action may be delayed where an applicant fails to provide additional information in a timely manner as requested by the Administrator under § 71.24(c).</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator will promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless the Administrator requests additional information or otherwise notifies the applicant of incompleteness within 45 days of receipt of an application, the application shall be deemed complete. For revisions that qualify as administrative amendments and are processed through the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section, a completeness determination need not be made.</P>
              <P>(4) If a source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance, the source's failure to have a title V permit for purposes of any requirements under section 112 pertaining to the early reductions source is not a violation of this part until the Administrator takes final action on the permit application. This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and as required by § 71.24(d), the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the Administrator any additional information identified as being needed to process the application.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Permit renewal and expiration.</E> (1) Permits issued under this subpart shall not be renewed. Permit renewal for expiring permits issued under this subpart shall be accomplished according to the requirements of title V of the Act for comprehensive permits for the facility containing the early reductions source.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, permit expiration terminates the early reductions source's right to operate.</P>
              <P>(3) If, consistent with the requirements of title V of the Act, a timely and complete application for a comprehensive title V permit for the facility containing the early reductions source has been submitted but the permitting authority has failed to issue or deny the comprehensive permit prior to expiration of a permit issued under this subpart, then the existing permit for the early reductions source shall not expire until the comprehensive title V permit for the facility has been issued or denied.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative permit amendments.</E> (1) An “administrative permit amendment” is a permit revision that:</P>
              <P>(i) Corrects typographical errors;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a similar minor administrative change at the source;</P>
              <P>(iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee;</P>

              <P>(iv) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of an early reductions source where the permitting authority determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the permitting authority; or<PRTPAGE P="327"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined to be ministerial in nature and, therefore, similar to those in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Administrative permit amendment procedures.</E> Administrative permit amendments may be made to a permit issued under this subpart using the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(i) The source shall submit to the Administrator an application containing a proposed addendum to the source's permit. The application shall demonstrate how the proposed change meets one of the criteria for administrative amendments set forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section, and include certification by the responsible official consistent with § 71.24(f) that the change is eligible for administrative amendment procedures. The addendum shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Identify the terms of the part 71, subpart B permit the source proposes to change;</P>
              <P>(B) Propose new permit terms consistent with the provisions of this subpart applicable to the change;</P>
              <P>(C) Designate the addendum as having been processed under the procedures of this paragraph (c); and</P>
              <P>(D) Specify that the addendum will be effective 60 days from the date of the Administrator's receipt, unless the Administrator disapproves the change within such period.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator will allow the source to implement the requested change immediately upon making all required submittals, including the proposed addendum.</P>
              <P>(iii) The proposed addendum will become effective 60 days after the Administrator receives the submittal, provided the Administrator has not disapproved the request in writing before the end of the 60-day period. The Administrator shall record the change by attaching a copy of the addendum to the part 71, subpart B permit.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the Administrator disapproves the change, he or she shall notify the source of the reasons for the disapproval in a timely manner. Upon receiving such notice, the source shall comply with the terms of the permit that it had proposed to change, and thereafter the proposed addendum shall not take effect.</P>
              <P>(v) The process in this paragraph (c) may also be used for changes initiated by the Administrator that meet the criteria under paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii), and (iv) of this section. For such changes, the Administrator will notify the source of the proposed change and its effective date, and shall attach a copy of the change to the existing permit. On the effective date of the proposed change, the source shall comply with the provisions of the proposed change.</P>
              <P>(vi) The permit shield under § 71.25(d) may not extend to administrative amendments processed under this paragraph (c)(2).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Permit revision procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Permit revision procedures shall be used for applications requesting permit revisions that do not qualify as administrative amendments. Nothing in this paragraph (d) shall be construed to preclude the permittee from making changes consistent with this subpart that would render existing permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant.</P>
              <P>(2) Permit revisions shall meet all requirements of this subpart, including those for applications, public participation, and review by affected States, as they apply to permit issuance. The Administrator will complete review on permit revisions within 9 months after receipt of a complete application.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reopening for cause.</E> (1) Each issued permit shall include provisions specifying the conditions under which the permit will be reopened. A permit shall be reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) The Administrator determines that the permit contains a material mistake or that inaccurate statements were made in establishing the emission limits or other terms or conditions of the permit.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator determines that the permit must be revised to assure compliance with the alternative emission limitation.</P>

              <P>(2) Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and shall affect only those <PRTPAGE P="328"/>parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists.</P>
              <P>(3) Reopenings under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not be initiated before a notice of such intent is provided to the early reductions source by the Administrator. Such notice will be provided at least 30 days in advance of the date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the Administrator may provide a shorter time period in the case of an emergency.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">EPA review under State programs for issuing specialty permits.</E> (1) If the Administrator approves a State program for the implementation of this subpart, the State program shall require that the Administrator receive a copy of each permit application (including any application for permit revision) each proposed permit, and each final permit issued pursuant to this subpart. The State program may require that the applicant provide a copy of any permit application directly to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator will object to the issuance of any proposed permit determined by the Administrator not to be in compliance with requirements under this subpart or part 63 of this chapter. If the Administrator objects in writing within 45 days of receipt of a proposed permit and all necessary supporting documentation, the State shall not issue the permit.</P>
              <P>(3) Any EPA objection to a proposed permit will include a statement of the Administrator's reasons for objection and a description of the terms and conditions that the permit must include to respond to the objections. The Administrator will provide the permit applicant a copy of the objection.</P>
              <P>(4) Failure of the State to do any of the following also shall constitute grounds for an objection:</P>
              <P>(i) Comply with paragraph (f)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Submit any information necessary to review adequately the proposed permit; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Process the permit under procedures approved to meet paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) If the State fails, within 90 days after the date of an objection under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, to revise and submit a proposed permit in response to the objection, the Administrator will issue or deny the permit in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Public petitions to the Administrator.</E> Within 60 days after expiration of the Administrator's 45-day review period, any person may petition the Administrator in writing to make an objection. Any such petition shall be based only on objections to the permit that were raised with reasonable specificity during the public comment period provided for and consistent with § 71.27, unless the petitioner demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such period, or unless the grounds for such objection arose after such period. If the Administrator objects to the permit as a result of a petition filed under this paragraph, the permitting authority shall not issue the permit until EPA's objection has been resolved, except that a petition for review does not stay the effectiveness of a permit or its requirements if the permit was issued after the end of the 45-day review period and prior to an objection. If the permitting authority has issued a permit prior to receipt of an EPA objection under this paragraph, the Administrator will revise, terminate, or revoke such permit, and shall do so consistent with the procedures in 40 CFR 70.7(g)(4) or (g)(5)(i) except in unusual circumstances, and the permitting authority may thereafter issue only a revised permit that satisfies EPA's objection. In any case, the source will not be in violation of the requirement to have submitted a timely and complete application.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 71.27</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Public participation and appeal.</SUBJECT>
              <P>All permit proceedings, including preparation of draft permits, initial permit issuance, permit revisions, and granted appeals, shall provide adequate procedures for public participation, including notice, opportunity for comment, a hearing if requested, and administrative appeal. Specific procedures shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination of permits.</E> (1) Permits may be revised, revoked and reissued, or terminated either at the request of <PRTPAGE P="329"/>any interested person (including the permittee) or upon the Administrator's initiative. However, permits may only be revised, revoked and reissued, or terminated for the reasons specified in §§ 71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e). All requests shall be in writing and shall contain facts or reasons supporting the request.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrator decides the request is not justified, he or she shall send the requester a brief written response giving a reason for the decision. Denials of requests for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination are not subject to public notice, comment, or hearings. Denials by the Administrator may be informally appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board by a letter briefly setting forth the relevant facts. The Board may direct the Administrator to begin revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination proceedings under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The appeal shall be considered denied if the Board takes no action within 60 days after receiving it. This informal appeal is, under 42 U.S.C. 307, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of EPA action in denying a request for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Except in the case of administrative amendment of a permit, if the Administrator tentatively decides to revise or revoke and reissue a permit under §§ 71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e), he or she shall prepare a draft permit under paragraph (b) of this section incorporating the proposed changes. The Administrator may request additional information and, in the case of a revised permit, shall require the submission of an updated application. In the case of revoked and reissued permits, the Administrator shall require the submission of a new application.</P>
              <P>(ii) In a permit revision under this subsection, only those conditions to be revised shall be reopened when a new draft permit is prepared. All other aspects of the existing permit shall remain in effect for the duration of the unrevised permit. When a permit is revoked and reissued under this subsection, the entire permit is reopened just as if the permit had expired and was being reissued. During any revocation and reissuance proceeding the permittee shall comply with all conditions of the existing permit until a new final permit is reissued.</P>
              <P>(4) If the Administrator tentatively decides to terminate a permit under §§ 71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e), he or she shall issue a notice of intent to terminate. A notice of intent to terminate is a type of draft permit which follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under paragraph (b) of this section. A notice of intent to terminate shall not be issued if the Administrator and the permittee agree to termination in the course of transferring permit responsibility to an approved State under § 71.21(e).</P>
              <P>(5) Any request by the permittee for revision to an existing permit shall be treated as a permit application and shall be processed in accordance with all requirements of § 71.24.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Draft permits.</E> (1) Once an application is complete, the Administrator shall tentatively decide whether to prepare a draft permit or to deny the application.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrator tentatively decides to deny the permit application, he or she shall issue a notice of intent to deny. A notice of intent to deny the permit application is a type of draft permit which follows the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under this subsection. If the Administrator's final decision is that the tentative decision to deny the permit application was incorrect, he or she shall withdraw the notice of intent to deny and proceed to prepare a draft permit under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Administrator decides to prepare a draft permit, he or she shall prepare a draft permit that contains the permit conditions under § 71.25.</P>
              <P>(4) All draft permits prepared under this subsection shall be publicly noticed and made available for public comment. The Administrator shall give notice of opportunity for a public hearing, issue a final decision and respond to comments. For all early reductions permits, an appeal may be taken under paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Statement of basis.</E> The Administrator shall prepare a statement of basis for every draft permit. The statement of basis shall briefly describe the derivation of the conditions of the draft permit and the reasons for them <PRTPAGE P="330"/>or, in the case of notices of intent to deny or terminate, reasons supporting the tentative decision. The statement of basis shall be sent to the applicant and, on request, to any other person.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Public notice of permit actions and public comment period</E>—(1) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (i) The Administrator shall give public notice that the following actions have occurred:</P>
              <P>(A) A permit application has been tentatively denied under paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
              <P>(B) A draft permit has been prepared under paragraph (b)(3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(C) A hearing has been scheduled under paragraph (f) of this section;</P>
              <P>(D) An appeal has been granted under paragraph (l)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) No public notice is required in the case of administrative permit amendments, or when a request for permit revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination has been denied under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Written notice of that denial shall be given to the requester and to the permittee.</P>
              <P>(iii) Public notices may describe more than one permit or permit action.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing.</E> (i) Public notice of the preparation of a draft permit or permit revision (including a notice of intent to deny a permit or permit revision application) shall allow at least 30 days for public comment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Public notice of a public hearing shall be given at least 30 days before the hearing. (Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as public notice of the draft permit or permit revision and the two notices may be combined.)</P>
              <P>(iii) The Administrator shall provide such notice and opportunity for participation to Affected States on or before the time that the Administrator provides this notice to the public.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Methods.</E> Public notice of activities described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section shall be given by the following methods:</P>
              <P>(i) By mailing a copy of a notice to the following persons (any person otherwise entitled to receive notice under this paragraph (d) may waive his or her rights to receive notice for any permit):</P>
              <P>(A) The applicant;</P>
              <P>(B) Any other agency which the Administrator knows has issued or is required to issue any other permit under the Clean Air Act for the same facility or activity;</P>
              <P>(C) Affected States and Indian Tribes;</P>
              <P>(D) Affected State and local air pollution control agencies, the chief executives of the city and county where the early reductions source is located, any comprehensive regional land use planning agency and any State, Federal Land Manager, or Indian Governing Body whose lands may be affected by emissions from the regulated activity;</P>

              <P>(E) Persons on a mailing list, including those who request in writing to be on the list. As part of this requirement, the Administrator shall notify the public of the opportunity to be put on the mailing list by way of generally accepted methods (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> hyperlink sign-up function or radio button on an agency Web site, sign-up sheet at a public hearing, etc.) that enable interested parties to subscribe to the mailing list. The Administrator may update the mailing list from time to time by requesting written indication of continued interest from those listed. The Administrator may delete from the list the name of any person who fails to respond to such a request within a reasonable timeframe;</P>
              <P>(F) Any unit of local government with authority for regulating air pollution and having jurisdiction over the area where the early reductions source is located and to each State agency having any authority for regulating air pollution under State law with respect to the operation of such source.</P>
              <P>(ii) By posting a notice on a public Web site identified by the Administrator for the duration of the public comment period. The notice shall be consistent with paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section and be accompanied by a copy of the draft permit.</P>

              <P>(iii) By any other method reasonably calculated to give actual notice of the action in question to the persons potentially affected by it, including press releases or any other forum or medium to elicit public participation.<PRTPAGE P="331"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Contents</E>—(i) <E T="03">All public notices.</E> All public notices issued under this subpart shall contain the following minimum information:</P>
              <P>(A) The name and address of the Administrator or the Administrator's designated agent processing the permit;</P>
              <P>(B) The name and address of the permittee or permit applicant and, if different, of the facility regulated by the permit;</P>
              <P>(C) The activity or activities involved in the permit action;</P>
              <P>(D) The emissions change involved in any permit revision;</P>
              <P>(E) The name, address and telephone number of a person from whom interested persons may obtain additional information, including copies of the draft permit, the application, all relevant supporting materials, and all other materials available to the Administrator that are relevant to the permit decision;</P>
              <P>(F) A brief description of the comment procedures required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and the time and place of any hearing that will be held, including a statement of procedures to request a hearing (unless a hearing has already been scheduled) and other procedures by which the public may participate in the final permit decision;</P>
              <P>(G) Any additional information considered necessary or proper; and</P>
              <P>(H) The physical location and/or Web site address of the administrative record, the times at which the record will be open for public inspection and a statement that all data submitted by the applicant are available as part of the administrative record.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Public notices for hearings.</E> In addition to the general public notice described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the public notice of a hearing under paragraph (f) of this section shall contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(A) Reference to the date of previous public notices relating to the permit;</P>
              <P>(B) Date, time, and place of the hearing; and</P>
              <P>(C) A brief description of the nature and purpose of the hearing, including the applicable rules and procedures.</P>
              <P>(5) In addition to the general public notice described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, all persons identified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section shall be mailed a copy of the fact sheet or statement of basis, the permit application (if any), and the draft permit (if any).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Public comments and requests for public hearings.</E> During the public comment period provided under paragraph (a) of this section, any interested person may submit written comments on the draft permit or permit revision and may request a public hearing, if no hearing has already been scheduled. A request for a public hearing shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the issues proposed to be raised at the hearing. All comments shall be considered in making the final decision and shall be answered as provided in paragraph (j) of this section. The Administrator will keep a record of the commenters and of the issues raised during the public participation process, and such records shall be available to the public.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Public hearings.</E> (1)(i) The Administrator shall hold a hearing whenever he or she finds, on the basis of requests, a significant degree of public interest in a draft permit or permit revision.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator may also hold a public hearing at his or her discretion, whenever, for instance, such a hearing might clarify one or more issues involved in the permit decision.</P>
              <P>(iii) Public notice of the hearing shall be given as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever a public hearing is held, the Administrator shall designate a Presiding Officer for the hearing who shall be responsible for its scheduling and orderly conduct.</P>

              <P>(3) Any person may submit oral or written statements and data concerning the draft permit or permit revision. Reasonable limits may be set upon the time allowed for oral statements, and the submission of statements in writing may be required. The public comment period under paragraph (d) of this section shall be automatically extended to the close of any public hearing under this subsection. The hearing officer may also extend the comment period by so stating at the hearing.<PRTPAGE P="332"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) A tape recording or written transcript of the hearing shall be made available to the public.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Obligation to raise issues and provide information during the public comment period.</E> All persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Administrator's tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must raise all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably ascertainable arguments supporting their position by the close of the public comment period (including any public hearing). Any supporting materials which are submitted shall be included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they are already part of the administrative record in the same proceeding, or consist of State or Federal statutes and regulations, EPA documents of general applicability, or other generally available reference materials. Commenters shall make supporting materials not already included in the administrative record available to EPA as directed by the Administrator. (A comment period longer than 30 days may be necessary to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (g). Additional time shall be granted to the extent that a commenter who requests additional time demonstrates the need for such time.)</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reopening of the public comment period.</E> (1)(i) The Administrator may order the public comment period reopened if the procedures of this paragraph (h) could expedite the decisionmaking process. When the public comment period is reopened under this paragraph (h), all persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Administrator's tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must submit all reasonably available factual grounds supporting their position, including all supporting material, by a date, not less than 60 days after public notice under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, set by the Administrator. Thereafter, any person may file a written response to the material filed by any other person, by a date, not less than 20 days after the date set for filing of the material, set by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(ii) Public notice of any comment period under this paragraph shall identify the issues to which the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(iii) On his or her own motion or on the request of any person, the Administrator may direct that the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section shall apply during the initial comment period where it reasonably appears that issuance of the permit will be contested and that applying the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section will substantially expedite the decisionmaking process. The notice of the draft permit shall state whenever this has been done.</P>
              <P>(iv) A comment period of longer than 60 days will often be necessary in complicated proceedings to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this subsection. Commenters may request longer comment periods and they shall be granted to the extent they appear necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) If any data, information, or arguments submitted during the public comment period appear to raise substantial new questions concerning a permit, the Administrator may take one or more of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(i) Prepare a new draft permit, appropriately modified;</P>
              <P>(ii) Prepare a revised statement of basis, a fact sheet or revised fact sheet, and reopen the comment period; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Reopen or extend the comment period to give interested persons an opportunity to comment on the information or arguments submitted.</P>
              <P>(3) Comments filed during the reopened comment period shall be limited to the substantial new questions that caused its reopening. The public notice shall define the scope of the reopening.</P>
              <P>(4) Public notice of any of the above actions shall be issued under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Issuance and effective date of permit.</E> (1) After the close of the public comment period on a draft permit, the Administrator shall issue a final permit <PRTPAGE P="333"/>decision. The Administrator shall notify the applicant and each person who has submitted written comments or requested notice of the final permit decision. This notice shall include reference to the procedures for appealing a decision on a permit. For the purposes of this paragraph (i), a final permit decision means a final decision to issue, deny, revise, revoke and reissue, or terminate a permit.</P>
              <P>(2) A final permit decision shall become effective 30 days after the service of notice of the decision unless:</P>
              <P>(i) A later effective date is specified in the decision; or</P>
              <P>(ii) No comments requested a change in the draft permit, in which case the permit shall become effective immediately upon issuance.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Response to comments.</E> (1) At the time that any final permit decision is issued, the Administrator shall issue a response to comments. This response shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Specify which provisions, if any, of the draft permit have been changed in the final permit decision, and the reasons for the change; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Briefly describe and respond to all significant comments on the draft permit raised during the public comment period, or during any hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) Any documents cited in the response to comments shall be included in the administrative record for the final permit decision as defined in paragraph (k) of this section. If new points are raised or new material supplied during the public comment period, EPA may document its response to those matters by adding new materials to the administrative record.</P>
              <P>(3) The response to comments shall be available to the public.</P>
              <P>(4) The Administrator will notify in writing any Affected State of any refusal to accept recommendations for the permit that the State submitted during the public or Affected State review period.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Administrative record for final permit.</E> (1) The Administrator shall base final permit decisions on the administrative record defined in this paragraph (k).</P>
              <P>(2) The administrative record for any final permit shall consist of:</P>
              <P>(i) All comments received during the public comment period, including any extension or reopening;</P>
              <P>(ii) The tape or transcript of any hearing(s) held;</P>
              <P>(iii) Any written material submitted at such a hearing;</P>
              <P>(iv) The response to comments required by paragraph (j) of this section and any new materials placed in the record under paragraph (j) of this section;</P>
              <P>(v) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the permit;</P>
              <P>(vi) The final permit;</P>
              <P>(vii) The application and any supporting data furnished by the applicant;</P>
              <P>(viii) The draft permit or notice of intent to deny the application or to terminate the permit;</P>
              <P>(ix) The statement of basis for the draft permit;</P>
              <P>(x) All documents cited in the statement of basis; and</P>
              <P>(xi) Other documents contained in the supporting file for the draft permit.</P>
              <P>(3) The additional documents required under paragraph (k)(2) of this section should be added to the record as soon as possible after their receipt or publication by EPA. The record shall be complete on the date the final permit is issued.</P>
              <P>(4) This section applies to all final permits.</P>
              <P>(5) Material readily available at the issuing Regional Office, or published materials which are generally available and which are included in the administrative record under the standards of paragraph (j) of this section (“response to comments”), need not be physically included in the same file as the rest of the record as long as it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis or fact sheet or in the response to comments.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Appeal of permits.</E> (1) Within 30 days after a final permit decision has been issued, any person who filed comments on the draft permit or participated in the public hearing may petition the Environmental Appeals Board to review any condition of the permit decision. Any person who failed to file comments or failed to participate in the public hearing on the draft permit may petition for administrative review <PRTPAGE P="334"/>only to the extent of the changes from the draft to the final permit decision. The 30-day period within which a person may request review under this subsection begins with the service of notice of the Administrator's action unless a later date is specified in that notice. The petition shall include a statement of the reasons supporting that review, including a demonstration that any issues raised were raised during the public comment period (including any public hearing) to the extent required by these regulations unless the petitioner demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such period or unless the grounds for such objection arose after such period, and, when appropriate, a showing that the condition in question is based on:</P>
              <P>(i) A finding of fact or conclusion of law which is clearly erroneous; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An exercise of discretion or an important policy consideration which the Environmental Appeals Board should, in its discretion, review.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board may also decide on its initiative to review any condition of any permit issued under this subpart. The Board must act under this paragraph within 30 days of the service date of notice of the Administrator's action.</P>
              <P>(3) Within a reasonable time following the filing of the petition for review, the Board shall issue an order either granting or denying the petition for review. To the extent review is denied, the conditions of the final permit decision become final agency action. Public notice of any grant of review by the Board under paragraph (l) (1) or (2) of this section shall be given as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Public notice shall set forth a briefing schedule for the appeal and shall state that any interested person may file an amicus brief. Notice of denial of review shall be sent only to applicant and to the person(s) requesting review.</P>
              <P>(4) A petition to the Board under paragraph (l)(1) of this section is, under 42 U.S.C. 307(b), a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review of the final agency action.</P>
              <P>(5) For purposes of judicial review, final agency action occurs when a final permit is issued or denied by EPA and agency review procedures are exhausted. A final permit decision shall be issued by the Administrator:</P>
              <P>(i) When the Board issues notice to the parties that review has been denied;</P>
              <P>(ii) When the Board issues a decision on the merits of the appeal and the decision does not include a remand of the proceedings; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Upon the completion of remand proceedings if the proceedings are remanded, unless the Board's remand order specifically provides that appeal of the remand decision will be required to exhaust administrative remedies.</P>
              <P>(6) Neither the filing of a petition for review of any condition of the permit or permit decision nor the granting of an appeal by the Environmental Appeals Board shall stay the effect of any contested permit or permit condition.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Computation of time.</E> (1) Any time period scheduled to begin on the occurrence of an act or event shall begin on the day after the act or event.</P>
              <P>(2) Any time period scheduled to begin before the occurrence of an act or event shall be computed so that the period ends on the day before the act or event, except as otherwise provided.</P>
              <P>(3) If the final day of any time period falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the time period shall be extended to the next working day.</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever a party or interested person has the right or is required to act within a prescribed period after the service of notice or other paper upon him or her by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed time.</P>
