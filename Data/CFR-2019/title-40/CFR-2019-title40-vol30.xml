      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(3) In this definition, the following terms apply:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Adjacent.</E> The term <E T="03">adjacent</E> means bordering, contiguous, or neighboring a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition, including waters separated by constructed dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, and the like. For purposes of adjacency, an open water such as a pond or lake includes any wetlands within or abutting its ordinary high water mark. Adjacency is not limited to waters located laterally to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition. Adjacent waters also include all waters that connect segments of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) or are located at the head of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition and are bordering, contiguous, or neighboring such water. Waters being used for established normal farming, ranching, and silviculture activities (33 U.S.C. 1344(f)) are not adjacent.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Neighboring.</E> The term <E T="03">neighboring</E> means:</P>
              <P>(A) All waters located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark;</P>
              <P>(B) All waters located within the 100-year floodplain of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition and not more than 1,500 feet from the ordinary high water mark of such water. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark and within the 100-year floodplain;</P>
              <P>(C) All waters located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) or (1)(iii) of this definition, and all waters within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line or within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Tributary</E> and <E T="03">tributaries.</E> The terms <E T="03">tributary</E> and <E T="03">tributaries</E> each mean a water that contributes flow, either directly or through another water (including an impoundment identified in paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition), to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition that is characterized by the presence of the physical indicators of a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark. These physical indicators demonstrate there is volume, frequency, and duration of flow sufficient to create a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark, and thus to qualify as a tributary. A tributary can be a natural, man-altered, or man-made water and includes waters such as rivers, streams, canals, and ditches not excluded under paragraph (2) of this definition. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if, for any length, there are one or more constructed breaks (such as <PRTPAGE P="15"/>bridges, culverts, pipes, or dams), or one or more natural breaks (such as wetlands along the run of a stream, debris piles, boulder fields, or a stream that flows underground) so long as a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark can be identified upstream of the break. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if it contributes flow through a water of the United States that does not meet the definition of tributary or through a non-jurisdictional water to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Wetlands.</E> The term <E T="03">wetlands</E> means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Significant nexus.</E> The term <E T="03">significant nexus</E> means that a water, including wetlands, either alone or in combination with other similarly situated waters in the region, significantly affects the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. The term “in the region” means the watershed that drains to the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. For an effect to be significant, it must be more than speculative or insubstantial. Waters are similarly situated when they function alike and are sufficiently close to function together in affecting downstream waters. For purposes of determining whether or not a water has a significant nexus, the water's effect on downstream (1)(i) through (iii) waters shall be assessed by evaluating the aquatic functions identified in paragraphs (3)(v)(A) through (I) of this definition. A water has a significant nexus when any single function or combination of functions performed by the water, alone or together with similarly situated waters in the region, contributes significantly to the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. Functions relevant to the significant nexus evaluation are the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Sediment trapping,</P>
              <P>(B) Nutrient recycling,</P>
              <P>(C) Pollutant trapping, transformation, filtering, and transport,</P>
              <P>(D) Retention and attenuation of flood waters,</P>
              <P>(E) Runoff storage,</P>
              <P>(F) Contribution of flow,</P>
              <P>(G) Export of organic matter,</P>
              <P>(H) Export of food resources, and</P>
              <P>(I) Provision of life cycle dependent aquatic habitat (such as foraging, feeding, nesting, breeding, spawning, or use as a nursery area) for species located in a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Ordinary high water mark.</E> The term <E T="03">ordinary high water mark</E> means that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">High tide line.</E> The term <E T="03">high tide line</E> means the line of intersection of the land with the water's surface at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high tide line may be determined, in the absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and other high tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds such as those accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Applicability date.</E> This definition is applicable beginning on February 6, 2020.</P>

SEMS is EPA's comprehensive data management system that inventories and tracks information about releases addressed or needing to be addressed by the CERCLA Superfund program. SEMS consolidates legacy systems including CERCLIS into a single integrated platform. SEMS contains information for potential and confirmed hazardous waste sites addressed under the Superfund remedial and removal programs. SEMS includes sites in the active site inventory and archived sites. The active site inventory includes sites on the NPL, and sites not on the NPL where site assessment, removal, remedial, enforcement, cost recovery, or oversight activities are being planned or conducted. Archived sites include non-NPL sites that were formerly in the active site inventory which have no further site assessment, removal, remedial, enforcement, cost recovery or oversight needed under the Federal Superfund program based on available information. New information may warrant return of an archive site to the active inventory. Inclusion of a specific site or area in SEMS does not represent a determination of any party's liability, nor does it represent a finding that any response action is necessary.”</P>

              <SUBJECT>Regional Response Teams.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Regional planning and coordination of preparedness and response actions is accomplished through the RRT. In the case of a discharge of oil, preparedness activities will be carried out in conjunction with Area Committees, as appropriate. The RRT agency membership parallels that of the NRT, as described in § 300.110, but also includes state and local representation. The RRT provides:</P>
              <P>(1) The appropriate regional mechanism for development and coordination of preparedness activities before a response action is taken and for coordination of assistance and advice to the OSC/RPM during such response actions; and</P>
              <P>(2) Guidance to Area Committees, as appropriate, to ensure inter-area consistency and consistency of individual ACPs with the RCP and NCP.</P>
              <P>(b) The two principal components of the RRT mechanism are a standing team, which consists of designated representatives from each participating federal agency, state governments, and local governments (as agreed upon by the states); and incident-specific teams formed from the standing team when the RRT is activated for a response. On incident-specific teams, participation by the RRT member agencies will relate to the technical nature of the incident and its geographic location.</P>
              <P>(1) The standing team's jurisdiction corresponds to the standard federal regions, except for Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the Caribbean area, each of which has a separate standing RRT. The role of the standing RRT includes communications systems and procedures, planning, coordination, training, evaluation, preparedness, and related matters on a regionwide basis. It also includes coordination of Area Committees for these functions in areas within their respective regions, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) The role of the incident-specific team is determined by the operational requirements of the response to a specific discharge or release. Appropriate levels of activation and/or notification of the incident-specific RRT, including participation by state and local governments, shall be determined by the designated RRT chair for the incident, based on the RCP. The incident-specific RRT supports the designated OSC/RPM. The designated OSC/RPM directs response efforts and coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release.</P>
              <P>(c) The representatives of EPA and the USCG shall act as co-chairs of RRTs except when the RRT is activated. When the RRT is activated for response actions, the chair shall be the member agency providing the OSC/RPM.</P>
              <P>(d) Each participating agency should designate one member and at least one alternate member to the RRT. Agencies whose regional subdivisions do not correspond to the standard federal regions may designate additional representatives to the standing RRT to ensure appropriate coverage of the standard federal region. Participating states may also designate one member and at least one alternate member to the RRT. Indian tribal governments may arrange for representation with the RRT appropriate to their geographical location. All agencies and states may also provide additional representatives as observers to meetings of the RRT.</P>
              <P>(e) RRT members should designate representatives and alternates from their agencies as resource personnel for RRT activities, including RRT work planning, and membership on incident-specific teams in support of the OSCs/RPMs.</P>

              <P>(f) Federal RRT members or their representatives should provide OSCs/<PRTPAGE P="30"/>RPMs with assistance from their respective federal agencies commensurate with agency responsibilities, resources, and capabilities within the region. During a response action, the members of the RRT should seek to make available the resources of their agencies to the OSC/RPM as specified in the RCP and ACP.</P>
              <P>(g) RRT members should nominate appropriately qualified representatives from their agencies to work with OSCs in developing and maintaining ACPs.</P>
              <P>(h) Affected states are encouraged to participate actively in all RRT activities. Each state governor is requested to assign an office or agency to represent the state on the appropriate RRT; to designate representatives to work with the RRT in developing RCPs; to plan for, make available, and coordinate state resources; and to serve as the contact point for coordination of response with local government agencies, whether or not represented on the RRT. The state's RRT representative should keep the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), described in § 300.205(d), apprised of RRT activities and coordinate RRT activities with the SERC. Local governments are invited to participate in activities on the appropriate RRT as provided by state law or as arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes are also invited to participate in such activities.</P>
              <P>(i) The standing RRT shall recommend changes in the regional response organization as needed, revise the RCP as needed, evaluate the preparedness of the participating agencies and the effectiveness of ACPs for the federal response to discharges and releases, and provide technical assistance for preparedness to the response community. The RRT should:</P>
              <P>(1) Review and comment, to the extent practicable, on local emergency response plans or other issues related to the preparation, implementation, or exercise of such plans upon request of a local emergency planning committee;</P>
              <P>(2) Evaluate regional and local responses to discharges or releases on a continuing basis, considering available legal remedies, equipment readiness, and coordination among responsible public agencies and private organizations, and recommend improvements;</P>
              <P>(3) Recommend revisions of the NCP to the NRT, based on observations of response operations;</P>
              <P>(4) Review OSC actions to ensure that RCPs and ACPs are effective;</P>
              <P>(5) Encourage the state and local response community to improve its preparedness for response;</P>
              <P>(6) In coordination with Area Committees and in accordance with any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements, conduct advance planning for use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, burning agents, bioremediation agents, or other chemical agents in accordance with subpart J of this part;</P>
              <P>(7) Be prepared to provide response resources to major discharges or releases outside the region;</P>
              <P>(8) Conduct or participate in training and exercises as necessary to encourage preparedness activities of the response community within the region;</P>
              <P>(9) Meet at least semiannually to review response actions carried out during the preceding period, consider changes in RCPs, and recommend changes in ACPs;</P>
              <P>(10) Provide letter reports on RRT activities to the NRT twice a year, no later than January 31 and July 31. At a minimum, reports should summarize recent activities, organizational changes, operational concerns, and efforts to improve state and local coordination; and</P>
              <P>(11) Ensure maximum participation in the national exercise program for announced and unannounced exercises.</P>
              <P>(j)(1) The RRT may be activated by the chair as an incident-specific response team when a discharge or release:</P>
              <P>(i) Exceeds the response capability available to the OSC/RPM in the place where it occurs;</P>
              <P>(ii) Transects state boundaries;</P>
              <P>(iii) May pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment, or to regionally significant amounts of property; or</P>

              <P>(iv) Is a worst case discharge, as described in § 300.324. RCPs shall specify detailed criteria for activation of RRTs.<PRTPAGE P="31"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The RRT will be activated during any discharge or release upon a request from the OSC/RPM, or from any RRT representative, to the chair of the RRT. Requests for RRT activation shall later be confirmed in writing. Each representative, or an appropriate alternate, should be notified immediately when the RRT is activated.</P>
              <P>(3) During prolonged removal or remedial action, the RRT may not need to be activated or may need to be activated only in a limited sense, or may need to have available only those member agencies of the RRT who are directly affected or who can provide direct response assistance.</P>
              <P>(4) When the RRT is activated for a discharge or release, agency representatives shall meet at the call of the chair and may:</P>
              <P>(i) Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC/RPM, advise the OSC/RPM on the duration and extent of response, and recommend to the OSC/RPM specific actions to respond to the discharge or release;</P>
              <P>(ii) Request other federal, state, or local governments, or private agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to respond to a discharge or release or to monitor response operations;</P>
              <P>(iii) Help the OSC/RPM prepare information releases for the public and for communication with the NRT;</P>
              <P>(iv) If the circumstances warrant, make recommendations to the regional or district head of the agency providing the OSC/RPM that a different OSC/RPM should be designated; and</P>
              <P>(v) Submit pollution reports to the NRC as significant developments occur.</P>
              <P>(5) At the regional level, a Regional Response Center (RRC) may provide facilities and personnel for communications, information storage, and other requirements for coordinating response. The location of each RRC should be provided in the RCP.</P>
              <P>(6) When the RRT is activated, affected states may participate in all RRT deliberations. State government representatives participating in the RRT have the same status as any federal member of the RRT.</P>
              <P>(7) The RRT can be deactivated when the incident-specific RRT chair determines that the OSC/RPM no longer requires RRT assistance.</P>
              <P>(8) Notification of the RRT may be appropriate when full activation is not necessary, with systematic communication of pollution reports or other means to keep RRT members informed as to actions of potential concern to a particular agency, or to assist in later RRT evaluation of regionwide response effectiveness.</P>
              <P>(k) Whenever there is insufficient national policy guidance on a matter before the RRT, a technical matter requiring solution, a question concerning interpretation of the NCP, or a disagreement on discretionary actions among RRT members that cannot be resolved at the regional level, it may be referred to the NRT, described in § 300.110, for advice.</P>

              <P>(a) The OSC/RPM directs response efforts and coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release. As part of the planning and preparedness for response, OSCs shall be predesignated by the regional or district head of the lead agency. EPA and the USCG shall predesignate OSCs for all areas in each region, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. RPMs shall be assigned by the lead agency to manage remedial or other response actions at NPL sites, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) The USCG shall provide OSCs for oil discharges, including discharges from facilities and vessels under the jurisdiction of another federal agency, within or threatening the coastal zone. The USCG shall also provide OSCs for the removal of releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants into or threatening the coastal zone, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The USCG shall not provide predesignated OSCs for discharges or releases from hazardous waste management facilities or in similarly chronic incidents. The USCG shall provide an initial response to discharges or releases from hazardous waste management facilities within <PRTPAGE P="32"/>the coastal zone in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT)/EPA Instrument of Redelegation (May 27, 1988) except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section. The USCG OSC shall contact the cognizant RPM as soon as it is evident that a removal may require a follow-up remedial action, to ensure that the required planning can be initiated and an orderly transition to an EPA or state lead can occur.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA shall provide OSCs for discharges or releases into or threatening the inland zone and shall provide RPMs for federally funded remedial actions, except in the case of state-lead federally funded response and as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. EPA will also assume all remedial actions at NPL sites in the coastal zone, even where removals are initiated by the USCG, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) In general, USCG Captains of the Port (COTP) shall serve as the designated OSCs for areas in the coastal zone for which an ACP is required under CWA section 311(j) and EPA Regional Administrators shall designate OSCs for areas in the inland zone for which an ACP is required under CWA section 311(j).</P>
              <P>(c) For releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, when the release is on, or the sole source of the release is from, any facility or vessel, including vessels bareboat-chartered and operated, under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD, DOE, or other federal agency:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of DOD or DOE, DOD or DOE shall provide OSCs/RPMs responsible for taking all response actions; and</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a federal agency other than EPA, DOD, or DOE, such agency shall provide OSCs for all removal actions that are not emergencies and shall provide RPMs for all remedial actions.</P>
              <P>(d) DOD will be the removal response authority with respect to incidents involving DOD military weapons and munitions or weapons and munitions under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD.</P>
              <P>(e) The OSC is responsible for overseeing development of the ACP in the area of the OSC's responsibility. ACPs shall, as appropriate, be accomplished in cooperation with the RRT, and designated state and local representatives. In contingency planning and removal, the OSC coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of other agencies, Area Committees, responsible parties, and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP, decision document, consent decree, administrative order, and lead agency-approved plans applicable to the response.</P>
              <P>(f) The RPM is the prime contact for remedial or other response actions being taken (or needed) at sites on the proposed or promulgated NPL, and for sites not on the NPL but under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of a federal agency. The RPM's responsibilities include:</P>
              <P>(1) Fund-financed response: The RPM coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of EPA, states and local governments, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and all other agencies and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP. Based upon the reports of these parties, the RPM recommends action for decisions by lead agency officials. The RPM's period of responsibility begins prior to initiation of the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS), described in § 300.430, and continues through design, remedial action, deletion of the site from the NPL, and the CERCLA cost recovery activity. When a removal and remedial action occur at the same site, the OSC and RPM should coordinate to ensure an orderly transition of responsibility.</P>

              <P>(2) Federal-lead non-Fund-financed response: The RPM coordinates, directs, and reviews the work of other agencies, responsible parties, and contractors to assure compliance with the NCP, Record of Decision (ROD), consent decree, administrative order, and lead agency-approved plans applicable to the response. Based upon the reports of these parties, the RPM shall recommend action for decisions by lead agency officials. The RPM's period of responsibility begins prior to initiation of the RI/FS, described in § 300.430, and continues through design and remedial action and the CERCLA cost recovery activity. The OSC and RPM shall ensure orderly transition of responsibilities from one to the other.<PRTPAGE P="33"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The RPM shall participate in all decision-making processes necessary to ensure compliance with the NCP, including, as appropriate, agreements between EPA or other federal agencies and the state. The RPM may also review responses where EPA has preauthorized a person to file a claim for reimbursement to determine that the response was consistent with the terms of such preauthorization in cases where claims are filed for reimbursement.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) Where a support agency has been identified through a cooperative agreement, Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA), or other agreement, that agency may designate a support agency coordinator (SAC) to provide assistance, as requested, by the OSC/RPM. The SAC is the prime representative of the support agency for response actions.</P>
              <P>(2) The SAC's responsibilities may include:</P>
              <P>(i) Providing and reviewing data and documents as requested by the OSC/RPM during the planning, design, and cleanup activities of the response action; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Providing other assistance as requested.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) The lead agency should provide appropriate training for its OSCs, RPMs, and other response personnel to carry out their responsibilities under the NCP.</P>
              <P>(2) OSCs/RPMs should ensure that persons designated to act as their on-scene representatives are adequately trained and prepared to carry out actions under the NCP, to the extent practicable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notification and communications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The National Response Center (NRC), located at USCG Headquarters, is the national communications center, continuously manned for handling activities related to response actions. The NRC acts as the single point of contact for all pollution incident reporting, and as the NRT communications center. Notice of discharges and releases must be made telephonically through a toll free number or a special local number (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD) and collect calls accepted). (Notification details appear in §§ 300.300 and 300.405.) The NRC receives and immediately relays telephone notices of discharges or releases to the appropriate predesignated federal OSC. The telephone report is distributed to any interested NRT member agency or federal entity that has established a written agreement or understanding with the NRC. The NRC evaluates incoming information and immediately advises FEMA of a potential major disaster situation.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commandant, USCG, in conjunction with other NRT agencies, shall provide the necessary personnel, communications, plotting facilities, and equipment for the NRC.</P>
              <P>(c) Notice of an oil discharge or release of a hazardous substance in an amount equal to or greater than the reportable quantity must be made immediately in accordance with 33 CFR part 153, subpart B, and 40 CFR part 302, respectively. Notification shall be made to the NRC Duty Officer, HQ USCG, Washington, DC, telephone (800) 424-8802 or (202) 267-2675. All notices of discharges or releases received at the NRC will be relayed immediately by telephone to the OSC.</P>

              <P>(a) In accordance with CWA and CERCLA, the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to act for the United States to take response measures deemed necessary to protect the public health or welfare or environment from discharges of oil or releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants except with respect to such releases on or from vessels or facilities under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of other federal agencies.</P>

              <P>(b) The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate and, in the case of a discharge posing a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States is required to initiate and direct, appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that any oil or CWA hazardous substance is discharged <PRTPAGE P="34"/>or there is a substantial threat of such discharge from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or on the navigable waters of the United States, on the adjoining shorelines to the navigable waters, into or on the waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under exclusive management authority of the United States; or</P>
              <P>(c) The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that any hazardous substance is released or there is a threat of such a release into the environment, or there is a release or threat of release into the environment of any pollutant or contaminant which may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare of the United States.</P>
              <P>(d) In addition to any actions taken by a state or local government, the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the relief from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA or section 106 of CERCLA as appropriate, including issuing administrative orders, that may be necessary to protect the public health or welfare, if the Administrator or Secretary determines:</P>
              <P>(1) That there may be an imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment of the United States, including fish, shellfish, and wildlife, public and private property, shorelines, beaches, habitats, and other living and nonliving natural resources under the jurisdiction or control of the United States, because of an actual or threatened discharge of oil or a CWA hazardous substance from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or upon the navigable waters of the United States; or</P>
              <P>(2) That there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment because of a release of a CERCLA hazardous substance from a facility.</P>
              <P>(e) Response actions to remove discharges originating from operations conducted subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act shall be in accordance with the NCP.</P>
              <P>(f) Where appropriate, when a discharge or release involves radioactive materials, the lead or support federal agency shall act consistent with the notification and assistance procedures described in the appropriate Federal Radiological Plan. For the purpose of the NCP, the FRERP (24 CFR part 2401) is the appropriate plan. Most radiological discharges and releases do not result in FRERP activation and should be handled in accordance with the NCP. However, releases from nuclear incidents subject to requirements for financial protection established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the Price-Anderson amendments (section 170) of the Atomic Energy Act are specifically excluded from CERCLA and NCP requirements.</P>
              <P>(g) Removal actions involving nuclear weapons should be conducted in accordance with the joint Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and FEMA Agreement for Response to Nuclear Incidents and Nuclear Weapons Significant Incidents (January 8, 1981).</P>
              <P>(h) If the situation is beyond the capability of state and local governments and the statutory authority of federal agencies, the President may, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, act upon a request by the governor and declare a major disaster or emergency and appoint a Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) to coordinate all federal disaster assistance activities. In such cases, the OSC/RPM would continue to carry out OSC/RPM responsibilities under the NCP, but would coordinate those activities with the FCO to ensure consistency with other federal disaster assistance activities.</P>

              <P>(i) In the event of a declaration of a major disaster by the President, the FEMA may activate the Federal Response Plan (FRP). A FCO, designated by the President, may implement the FRP and coordinate and direct emergency assistance and disaster relief of <PRTPAGE P="35"/>impacted individuals, business, and public services under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Delivery of federal assistance is facilitated through twelve functional annexes to the FRP known as Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). EPA coordinates activities under ESF #10—Hazardous Materials, which addresses preparedness and response to hazardous materials and oil incidents caused by a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. In such cases, the OSC/RPM should coordinate response activities with the FCO, through the incident-specific ESF #10 Chair, to ensure consistency with federal disaster assistance activities.</P>

              <P>(a) The OSC/RPM, consistent with §§ 300.120 and 300.125, shall direct response efforts and coordinate all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release. As part of the planning and preparation for response, the OSCs/RPMs shall be predesignated by the regional or district head of the lead agency.</P>
              <P>(b) The first federal official affiliated with an NRT member agency to arrive at the scene of a discharge or release should coordinate activities under the NCP and is authorized to initiate, in consultation with the OSC, any necessary actions normally carried out by the OSC until the arrival of the predesignated OSC. This official may initiate federal fund-financed actions only as authorized by the OSC or, if the OSC is unavailable, the authorized representative of the lead agency.</P>
              <P>(c) The OSC/RPM shall, to the extent practicable, collect pertinent facts about the discharge or release, such as its source and cause; the identification of potentially responsible parties; the nature, amount, and location of discharged or released materials; the probable direction and time of travel of discharged or released materials; whether the discharge is a worst case discharge as discussed in § 300.324; the pathways to human and environmental exposure; the potential impact on human health, welfare, and safety and the environment; whether the discharge or release poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States as discussed in § 300.322; the potential impact on natural resources and property which may be affected; priorities for protecting human health and welfare and the environment; and appropriate cost documentation.</P>
              <P>(d) The OSC's/RPM's efforts shall be coordinated with other appropriate federal, state, local, and private response agencies. OSCs/RPMs may designate capable persons from federal, state, or local agencies to act as their on-scene representatives. State and local governments, however, are not authorized to take actions under subparts D and E of the NCP that involve expenditures of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund or CERCLA funds unless an appropriate contract or cooperative agreement has been established. The basic framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings together the functions of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC maintains authority.</P>
              <P>(e) The OSC/RPM should consult regularly with the RRT and NSFCC, as appropriate, in carrying out the NCP and keep the RRT and NSFCC, as appropriate, informed of activities under the NCP.</P>
              <P>(f) The OSC/RPM shall advise the support agency as promptly as possible of reported releases.</P>
              <P>(g) The OSC/RPM should evaluate incoming information and immediately advise FEMA of potential major disaster situations.</P>
              <P>(h) In those instances where a possible public health emergency exists, the OSC/RPM should notify the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) representative to the RRT. Throughout response actions, the OSC/RPM may call upon the HHS representative for assistance in determining public health threats and call upon the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and HHS for assistance on worker health and safety issues.</P>

              <P>(i) All federal agencies should plan for emergencies and develop procedures for dealing with oil discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants from vessels and <PRTPAGE P="36"/>facilities under their jurisdiction.

If a discharge or release affects areas covered by two or more ACPs or RCPs, the response mechanisms of each applicable plan may be activated. In this case, response actions of all regions concerned shall be fully coordinated as detailed in the RCPs and ACPs.</P>
              <P>(b) There shall be only one OSC and/or RPM at any time during the course of a response operation. Should a discharge or release affect two or more areas, EPA, the USCG, DOD, DOE, or other lead agency, as appropriate, shall give prime consideration to the area vulnerable to the greatest threat, in determining which agency should provide the OSC and/or RPM. The RRT shall designate the OSC and/or RPM if the RRT member agencies who have response authority within the affected areas are unable to agree on the designation. The NRT shall designate the OSC and/or RPM if members of one RRT or two adjacent RRTs are unable to agree on the designation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Special teams and other assistance available to OSCs/RPMs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The NSF is a special team established by the USCG, including the three USCG Strike Teams, the Public Information Assist Team (PIAT), and the NSFCC. The NSF is available to assist OSCs/RPMs in their preparedness and response duties.</P>
              <P>(1) The three Strike Teams (Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific) provide trained personnel and specialized equipment to assist the OSC in training for spill response, stabilizing and containing the spill, and in monitoring or directing the response actions of the responsible parties and/or contractors. The OSC has a specific team designated for initial contact and may contact that team directly for any assistance.</P>
              <P>(2) The NSFCC can provide the following support to the OSC:</P>
              <P>(i) Technical assistance, equipment and other resources to augment the OSC staff during spill response.</P>
              <P>(ii) Assistance in coordinating the use of private and public resources in support of the OSC during a response to or a threat of a worst case discharge of oil.</P>

              <P>(iii) Review of the area contingency plan, including an evaluation of equipment readiness and coordination among responsible public agencies and private organizations.<PRTPAGE P="37"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Assistance in locating spill response resources for both response and planning, using the NSFCC's national and international computerized inventory of spill response resources.</P>
              <P>(v) Coordination and evaluation of pollution response exercises.</P>
              <P>(vi) Inspection of district prepositioned pollution response equipment.</P>
              <P>(3) PIAT is an element of the NSFCC staff which is available to assist OSCs to meet the demands for public information during a response or exercise. Its use is encouraged any time the OSC requires outside public affairs support. Requests for PIAT assistance may be made through the NSFCC or NRC.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The Environmental Response Team (ERT) is established by EPA in accordance with its disaster and emergency responsibilities. The ERT has expertise in treatment technology, biology, chemistry, hydrology, geology, and engineering.</P>
              <P>(2) The ERT can provide access to special decontamination equipment for chemical releases and advice to the OSC/RPM in hazard evaluation; risk assessment; multimedia sampling and analysis program; on-site safety, including development and implementation plans; cleanup techniques and priorities; water supply decontamination and protection; application of dispersants; environmental assessment; degree of cleanup required; and disposal of contaminated material.</P>
              <P>(3) The ERT also provides both introductory and intermediate level training courses to prepare response personnel.</P>
              <P>(4) OSC/RPM or RRT requests for ERT support should be made to the EPA representative on the RRT; EPA Headquarters, Director, Emergency Response Division; or the appropriate EPA regional emergency coordinator.</P>
              <P>(c) Scientific Support Coordinators (SSCs) may be designated by the OSC (and RPM in the case of EPA SSCs) as the principal advisors for scientific issues, communication with the scientific community, and coordination of requests for assistance from state and federal agencies regarding scientific studies. The SSC strives for a consensus on scientific issues affecting the response, but ensures that differing opinions within the community are communicated to the OSC/RPM.</P>
              <P>(1) Generally, SSCs are provided by NOAA in the coastal zones, and by EPA in the inland zone. OSC/RPM requests for SSC support can be made directly to the SSC assigned to the area or to the agency member of the RRT. NOAA SSCs can also be requested through NOAA's SSC program office in Seattle, WA. NOAA SSCs are assigned to USCG Districts and are supported by a scientific support team that includes expertise in environmental chemistry, oil slick tracking, pollutant transport modeling, natural resources at risk, environmental tradeoffs of countermeasures and cleanup, and information management.</P>
              <P>(2) During a response, the SSC serves on the federal OSC's/RPM's staff and may, at the request of the OSC/RPM, lead the scientific team and be responsible for providing scientific support for operational decisions and for coordinating on-scene scientific activity. Depending on the nature and location of the incident, the SSC integrates expertise from governmental agencies, universities, community representatives, and industry to assist the OSC/RPM in evaluating the hazards and potential effects of releases and in developing response strategies.</P>
              <P>(3) At the request of the OSC, the SSC may facilitate the OSC's work with the lead administrative trustee for natural resources to ensure coordination between damage assessment data collection efforts and data collected in support of response operations.</P>
              <P>(4) SSCs support the Regional Response Teams and the Area Committees in preparing regional and area contingency plans and in conducting spill training and exercises. For area plans, the SSC provides leadership for the synthesis and integration of environmental information required for spill response decisions in support of the OSC.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) SUPSALV has an extensive salvage/search and recovery equipment inventory with the requisite knowledge and expertise to support these operations, including specialized salvage, firefighting, and petroleum, oil and lubricants offloading capability.<PRTPAGE P="38"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) When possible, SUPSALV will provide equipment for training exercises in support of national and regional contingency planning objectives.</P>
              <P>(3) The OSC/RPM may request assistance directly from SUPSALV. Formal requests are routed through the Chief of Naval Operations (N312).</P>
              <P>(e) For marine salvage operations, OSCs/RPMs with responsibility for monitoring, evaluating, or supervising these activities should request technical assistance from DOD, the Strike Teams, or commercial salvors as necessary to ensure that proper actions are taken. Marine salvage operations generally fall into five categories: afloat salvage; offshore salvage; river and harbor clearance; cargo salvage; and rescue towing. Each category requires different knowledge and specialized types of equipment. The complexity of such operations may be further compounded by local environmental and geographic conditions. The nature of marine salvage and the conditions under which it occurs combine to make such operations imprecise, difficult, hazardous, and expensive. Thus, responsible parties or other persons attempting to perform such operations without adequate knowledge, equipment, and experience could aggravate, rather than relieve, the situation.</P>
              <P>(f) Radiological Emergency Response Teams (RERTs) have been established by EPA's Office of Radiation Programs (ORP) to provide response and support for incidents or sites containing radiological hazards. Expertise is available in radiation monitoring, radionuclide analysis, radiation health physics, and risk assessment. RERTs can provide on-site support including mobile monitoring laboratories for field analyses of samples and fixed laboratories for radiochemical sampling and analyses. Requests for support may be made 24 hours a day via the NRC or directly to the EPA Radiological Response Coordinator in the Office of Radiation Programs. Assistance is also available from DOE and other federal agencies.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) DRGs assist the OSC by providing technical assistance, personnel, and equipment, including pre-positioned equipment. Each DRG consists of all Coast Guard personnel and equipment, including marine firefighting equipment, in its district, additional pre-positioned equipment, and a District Response Advisory Team (DRAT) that is available to provide support to the OSC in the event that a spill exceeds local response capabilities. Each DRG:</P>
              <P>(i) Shall provide technical assistance, equipment, and other resources, as available, when requested by an OSC through the USCG representative to the RRT;</P>

              <P>(iv) Shall review each of those plans that affect its area of geographic responsibility.</P>
              <P>(2) In deciding where to locate personnel and pre-positioned equipment, the USCG shall give priority emphasis to:</P>
              <P>(i) The availability of facilities for loading and unloading heavy or bulky equipment by barge;</P>
              <P>(ii) The proximity to an airport capable of supporting large military transport aircraft;</P>
              <P>(iii) The flight time to provide response to oil spills in all areas of the Coast Guard district with the potential for marine casualties;</P>
              <P>(iv) The availability of trained local personnel capable of responding in an oil spill emergency; and</P>
              <P>(v) Areas where large quantities of petroleum products are transported.</P>
              <P>(h) The NPFC is responsible for implementing those portions of Title I of the OPA that have been delegated to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. The NPFC is responsible for addressing funding issues arising from discharges and threats of discharges of oil. The NPFC:</P>
              <P>(1) Issues Certificates of Financial Responsibility to owners and operators of vessels to pay for costs and damages that are incurred by their vessels as a result of oil discharges;</P>

              <P>(2) Provides funding for various response organizations for timely abatement and removal actions related to oil discharges;<PRTPAGE P="39"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Provides equitable compensation to claimants who sustain costs and damages from oil discharges when the responsible party fails to do so;</P>
              <P>(4) Recovers monies from persons liable for costs and damages resulting from oil discharges to the full extent of liability under the law; and</P>
              <P>(5) Provides funds to initiate natural resource damage assessments.</P>

              <P>(a) Response actions under the NCP will comply with the provisions for response action worker safety and health in 29 CFR 1910.120. The NRS meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120 concerning use of an incident command system.</P>
              <P>(b) In a response action taken by a responsible party, the responsible party must assure that an occupational safety and health program consistent with 29 CFR 1910.120 is made available for the protection of workers at the response site.</P>

              <P>(c) In a response taken under the NCP by a lead agency, an occupational safety and health program should be made available for the protection of workers at the response site, consistent with, and to the extent required by, 29 CFR 1910.120. Contracts relating to a response action under the NCP should contain assurances that the contractor at the response site will comply with this program and with any applicable provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (OSH Act) and state laws with plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act.</P>
              <P>(d) When a state, or political subdivision of a state, without an OSHA-approved state plan is the lead agency for response, the state or political subdivision must comply with standards in 40 CFR part 311, promulgated by EPA pursuant to section 126(f) of SARA.</P>
              <P>(e) Requirements, standards, and regulations of the OSH Act and of state OSH laws not directly referenced in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, must be complied with where applicable. Federal OSH Act requirements include, among other things, Construction Standards (29 CFR part 1926), General Industry Standards (29 CFR part 1910), and the general duty requirement of section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 654(a)(1)). No action by the lead agency with respect to response activities under the NCP constitutes an exercise of statutory authority within the meaning of section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act. All governmental agencies and private employers are directly responsible for the health and safety of their own employees.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Public information and community relations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When an incident occurs, it is imperative to give the public prompt, accurate information on the nature of the incident and the actions underway to mitigate the damage. OSCs/RPMs and community relations personnel should ensure that all appropriate public and private interests are kept informed and that their concerns are considered throughout a response. They should coordinate with available public affairs/community relations resources to carry out this responsibility by establishing, as appropriate, a Joint Information Center bringing together resources from federal and state agencies and the responsible party.</P>

              <P>(b) An on-scene news office may be established to coordinate media relations and to issue official federal information on an incident. Whenever possible, it will be headed by a representative of the lead agency. The OSC/RPM determines the location of the on-scene news office, but every effort should be made to locate it near the scene of the incident. If a participating agency believes public interest warrants the issuance of statements and an on-scene news office has not been established, the affected agency should recommend its establishment. All federal news releases or statements by participating agencies should be cleared through the OSC/RPM. Information dissemination relating to natural resource damage assessment activities shall be coordinated through the lead administrative trustee. The designated lead administrative trustee may assist the OSC/RPM by disseminating information on issues relating to damage assessment activities. Following termination of removal activity, information dissemination on damage assessment activities <PRTPAGE P="40"/>shall be through the lead administrative trustee.</P>
              <P>(c) The community relations requirements specified in §§ 300.415, 300.430, and 300.435 apply to removal, remedial, and enforcement actions and are intended to promote active communication between communities affected by discharges or releases and the lead agency responsible for response actions. Community Relations Plans (CRPs) are required by EPA for certain response actions. The OSC/RPM should ensure coordination with such plans which may be in effect at the scene of a discharge or release or which may need to be developed during follow-up activities.</P>

              <P>(1) During all phases of response, the lead agency shall complete and maintain documentation to support all actions taken under the NCP and to form the basis for cost recovery. In general, documentation shall be sufficient to provide the source and circumstances of the release, the identity of responsible parties, the response action taken, accurate accounting of federal, state, or private party costs incurred for response actions, and impacts and potential impacts to the public health and welfare and the environment. Where applicable, documentation shall state when the NRC received notification of a release of a reportable quantity.</P>
              <P>(2) The information and reports obtained by the lead agency for Fund-financed response actions shall, as appropriate, be transmitted to the chair of the RRT. Copies can then be forwarded to the NRT, members of the RRT, and others as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) The lead agency shall make available to the trustees of affected natural resources information and documentation that can assist the trustees in the determination of actual or potential natural resource injuries.</P>
              <P>(b) For discharges of oil, documentation and cost recovery provisions are described in § 300.315.</P>
              <P>(c) Response actions undertaken by the participating agencies shall be carried out under existing programs and authorities when available. Federal agencies are to make resources available, expend funds, or participate in response to discharges and releases under their existing authority. Interagency agreements may be signed when necessary to ensure that the federal resources will be available for a timely response to a discharge or release. The ultimate decision as to the appropriateness of expending funds rests with the agency that is held accountable for such expenditures. Further funding provisions for discharges of oil are described in § 300.335.</P>
              <P>(d) The Administrator of EPA and the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) shall assure that the costs of health assessment or health effect studies conducted under the authority of CERCLA section 104(i) are documented in accordance with standard EPA procedures for cost recovery.

              <P>(i) The Forest Service has responsibility for protection and management of national forests and national grasslands. The Forest Service has personnel, laboratory, and field capability to measure, evaluate, monitor, and control as needed, releases of pesticides and other hazardous substances on lands under its jurisdiction.</P>

              <P>(ii) The Agriculture Research Service (ARS) administers an applied and developmental research program in animal and plant protection and production; the use and improvement of soil, water, and air; the processing, storage, and distribution of farm products; and human nutrition. The ARS has the capabilities to provide regulation of, and evaluation and training for, employees exposed to biological, chemical, radiological, and industrial hazards. In emergency situations, the ARS can identify, control, and abate pollution in the areas of air, soil, wastes, pesticides, radiation, and toxic substances for ARS facilities.<PRTPAGE P="43"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has personnel in nearly every county in the nation who are knowledgeable in soil, agronomy, engineering, and biology. These personnel can help to predict the effects of pollutants on soil and their movements over and through soils. Technical specialists can assist in identifying potential hazardous waste sites and provide review and advice on plans for remedial measures.</P>
              <P>(iv) The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) can respond in an emergency to regulate movement of diseased or infected organisms to prevent the spread and contamination of nonaffected areas.</P>
              <P>(v) The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has responsibility to prevent meat and poultry products contaminated with harmful substances from entering human food channels. In emergencies, the FSIS works with other federal and state agencies to establish acceptability for slaughter of exposed or potentially exposed animals and their products. In addition they are charged with managing the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Program for the USDA.</P>
              <P>(7) DOC, through NOAA, provides scientific support for response and contingency planning in coastal and marine areas, including assessments of the hazards that may be involved, predictions of movement and dispersion of oil and hazardous substances through trajectory modeling, and information on the sensitivity of coastal environments to oil and hazardous substances and associated clean-up and mitigation methods; provides expertise on living marine resources and their habitats, including endangered species, marine mammals and National Marine Sanctuary ecosystems; provides information on actual and predicted meteorological, hydrological, ice, and oceanographic conditions for marine, coastal, and inland waters, and tide and circulation data for coastal and territorial waters and for the Great Lakes.</P>
              <P>(8) HHS assists with the assessment, preservation, and protection of human health and helps ensure the availability of essential human services. HHS provides technical and nontechnical assistance in the form of advice, guidance, and resources to other federal agencies as well as state and local governments.</P>
              <P>(i) The principal HHS response comes from the U.S. Public Health Service and is coordinated from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and various Public Health Service regional offices. Within the Public Health Service, the primary response to a hazardous materials emergency comes from Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Both ATSDR and CDC have a 24-hour emergency response capability wherein scientific and technical personnel are available to provide technical assistance to the lead federal agency and state and local response agencies on human health threat assessment and analysis, and exposure prevention and mitigation. Such assistance is used for situations requiring evacuation of affected areas, human exposure to hazardous materials, and technical advice on mitigation and prevention. CDC takes the lead during petroleum releases regulated under the CWA and OPA while ATSDR takes the lead during chemical releases under CERCLA. Both agencies are mutually supportive.</P>
              <P>(ii) Other Public Health Service agencies involved in support during hazardous materials incidents either directly or through ATSDR/CDC include the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health.</P>
              <P>(iii) Statutory authority for HHS/National Institutes for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) involvement in hazardous materials accident prevention is non-regulatory in nature and focused on two primary areas for preventing community and worker exposure to hazardous materials releases: Worker safety training and basic research activities. Under section 126 of SARA, NIEHS is given statutory authority for supporting development of curricula and model training programs for waste workers and chemical emergency responders.</P>

              <P>Under section 118(b) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation and Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA) (49 U.S.C. 1802 <E T="03">et <PRTPAGE P="44"/>seq.</E>), NIEHS also administers the Hazmat Employee Training Program to prepare curricula and training for hazardous materials transportation workers. In the basic research arena, NIEHS is authorized under section 311 of SARA to conduct a hazardous substance basic research and training program to evaluate toxic effects and assess human health risks from accidental releases of hazardous materials. Under Title IX, section 901(h) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, NIEHS also is authorized to conduct basic research on air pollutants, as well as train physicians in environmental health. Federal research and training in hazardous materials release prevention represents an important non-regulatory activity and supplements ongoing private sector programs.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Federal contingency plans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>There are three levels of contingency plans under the national response system: The National Contingency Plan, RCPs, and ACPs. These plans are available for inspection at EPA regional offices or USCG district offices. Addresses and telephone numbers for these offices may be found in the United States Government Manual, issued annually, or in local telephone directories.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">The National Contingency Plan.</E> The purpose and objectives, authority, and scope of the NCP are described in §§ 300.1 through 300.3.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Regional Contingency Plans.</E> The RRTs, working with the states, shall develop federal RCPs for each standard federal region, Alaska, Oceania in the <PRTPAGE P="49"/>Pacific, and the Caribbean to coordinate timely, effective response by various federal agencies and other organizations to discharges of oil or releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. RCPs shall, as appropriate, include information on all useful facilities and resources in the region, from government, commercial, academic, and other sources. To the greatest extent possible, RCPs shall follow the format of the NCP and be coordinated with state emergency response plans, ACPs, which are described in § 300.210(c), and Title III local emergency response plans, which are described in § 300.215. Such coordination should be accomplished by working with the SERCs in the region covered by the RCP. RCPs shall contain lines of demarcation between the inland and coastal zones, as mutually agreed upon by USCG and EPA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Area Contingency Plans.</E> (1) Under the direction of an OSC and subject to approval by the lead agency, each Area Committee, in consultation with the appropriate RRTs, Coast Guard DRGs, the NSFCC, SSCs, LEPCs, and SERCs, shall develop an ACP for its designated area. This plan, when implemented in conjunction with other provisions of the NCP, shall be adequate to remove a worst case discharge under § 300.324, and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge, from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility operating in or near the area.</P>
              <P>(2) The areas of responsibility may include several Title III local planning districts, or parts of such districts. In developing the ACP, the OSC shall coordinate with affected SERCs and LEPCs. The ACP shall provide for a well coordinated response that is integrated and compatible, to the greatest extent possible, with all appropriate response plans of state, local, and non-federal entities, and especially with Title III local emergency response plans.</P>
              <P>(3) The ACP shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the area covered by the plan, including the areas of special economic or environmental importance that might be damaged by a discharge;</P>
              <P>(ii) A description in detail of the responsibilities of an owner or operator and of federal, state, and local agencies in removing a discharge, and in mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of a discharge;</P>
              <P>(iii) A list of equipment (including firefighting equipment), dispersants, or other mitigating substances and devices, and personnel available to an owner or operator and federal, state, and local agencies, to ensure an effective and immediate removal of a discharge, and to ensure mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a discharge (this may be provided in an appendix or by reference to other relevant emergency plans (e.g., state or LEPC plans), which may include such equipment lists);</P>
              <P>(iv) A description of procedures to be followed for obtaining an expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants; and</P>

              <P>(4)(i) In order to provide for coordinated, immediate and effective protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of, and minimization of risk of injury to, fish and wildlife resources and habitat, Area Committees shall incorporate into each ACP a detailed annex containing a Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan that is consistent with the RCP and NCP. The annex shall be prepared in consultation with the USFWS and NOAA and other interested natural resource management agencies and parties. It shall address fish and wildlife resources and their habitat, and shall include other areas considered sensitive environments in a separate section of the annex, based upon Area Committee recommendations. The annex will provide the necessary information and procedures to immediately and effectively respond to discharges that may adversely affect fish and wildlife and their habitat and sensitive environments, including provisions for a response to a worst case discharge. Such information shall include the identification of appropriate agencies and <PRTPAGE P="50"/>their responsibilities, procedures to notify these agencies following a discharge or threat of a discharge, protocols for obtaining required fish and wildlife permits and other necessary permits, and provisions to ensure compatibility of annex-related activities with removal operations.</P>
              <P>(ii) The annex shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Identify and establish priorities for fish and wildlife resources and their habitats and other important sensitive areas requiring protection from any direct or indirect effects from discharges that may occur. These effects include, but are not limited to, any seasonal or historical use, as well as all critical, special, significant, or otherwise designated protected areas.</P>
              <P>(B) Provide a mechanism to be used during a spill response for timely identification of protection priorities of those fish and wildlife resources and habitats and sensitive environmental areas that may be threatened or injured by a discharge. These include as appropriate, not only marine and freshwater species, habitats, and their food sources, but also terrestrial wildlife and their habitats that may be affected directly by onshore oil or indirectly by oil-related factors, such as loss or contamination of forage. The mechanism shall also provide for expeditious evaluation and appropriate consultations on the effects to fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive environments from the application of chemical countermeasures or other countermeasures not addressed under paragraph (e)(4)(iii).</P>
              <P>(C) Identify potential environmental effects on fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive environments resulting from removal actions or countermeasures, including the option of no removal. Based on this evaluation of potential environmental effects, the annex should establish priorities for application of countermeasure and removal actions to habitats within the geographic region of the ACP. The annex should establish methods to minimize the identified effects on fish and wildlife because of response activities, including, but not limited to: Disturbance of sensitive areas and habitats; illegal or inadvertent taking or disturbance of fish and wildlife or specimens by response personnel; and fish and wildlife, their habitat, and environmentally sensitive areas coming in contact with various cleaning or bioremediation agents. Furthermore, the annex should identify the areas where the movement of oiled debris may pose a risk to resident, transient, or migratory fish and wildlife, and other sensitive environments and should discuss measures to be considered for removing such oiled debris in a timely fashion to reduce such risk.</P>
              <P>(D) Provide for pre-approval of application of specific countermeasures or removal actions that, if expeditiously applied, will minimize adverse spill-induced impacts to fish and wildlife resources, their habitat, and other sensitive environments. Such pre-approval plans must be consistent with paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section and subpart J requirements, and must have the concurrence of the natural resource trustees.</P>
              <P>(E) Provide monitoring plan(s) to evaluate the effectiveness of different countermeasures or removal actions in protecting the environment. Monitoring should include “set-aside” or “control” areas, where no mitigative actions are taken.</P>
              <P>(F) Identify and plan for the acquisition and utilization of necessary response capabilities for protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of fish and wildlife resources and habitat. This may include appropriately permitted private organizations and individuals with appropriate expertise and experience. The suitable organizations should be identified in cooperation with natural resource law enforcement agencies. Such capabilities shall include, but not be limited to, identification of facilities and equipment necessary for deterring sensitive fish and wildlife from entering oiled areas, and for capturing, holding, cleaning, and releasing injured wildlife. Plans for the provision of such capabilities shall ensure that there is no interference with other OSC removal operations.</P>

              <P>(G) Identify appropriate federal and state agency contacts and alternates responsible for coordination of fish and wildlife rescue and rehabilitation and protection of sensitive environments; identify and provide for required fish <PRTPAGE P="51"/>and wildlife handling and rehabilitation permits necessary under federal and state laws; and provide guidance on the implementation of law enforcement requirements included under current federal and state laws and corresponding regulations. Requirements include, but are not limited to procedures regarding the capture, transport, rehabilitation, and release of wildlife exposed to or threatened by oil, and disposal of contaminated carcasses of wildlife.</P>
              <P>(H) Identify and secure the means for providing, if needed, the minimum required OSHA and EPA training for volunteers, including those who assist with injured wildlife.</P>
              <P>(I) Define the requirements for evaluating the compatibility between this annex and non-federal response plans (including those of vessels, facilities, and pipelines) on issues affecting fish and wildlife, their habitat, and sensitive environments.</P>

              <P>This section describes and cross-references the regulations that implement section 311(j)(5) of the CWA. A tank vessel, as defined under section 2101 of title 46, U.S. Code, an offshore facility, and an onshore facility that, because of its location, could reasonably expect to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone must prepare and submit a plan for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge, of oil or a hazardous substance. These response plans are required to be consistent with applicable Area Contingency Plans. These regulations are codified as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) For tank vessels, these regulations are codified in 33 CFR part 155;</P>
              <P>(b) For offshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 30 CFR part 254;</P>
              <P>(c) For non-transportation related onshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 40 CFR 112.20;</P>
              <P>(d) For transportation-related onshore facilities, these regulations are codified in 33 CFR part 154;</P>
              <P>(e) For pipeline facilities, these regulations are codified in 49 CFR part 194; and</P>
              <P>(f) For rolling stock, these regulations are codified in 49 CFR part 106 et al.</P>

              <P>(a) A discharge of oil may be discovered through:</P>
              <P>(1) A report submitted by the person in charge of a vessel or facility, in accordance with statutory requirements;</P>
              <P>(2) Deliberate search by patrols;</P>

              <P>(4) Other sources.</P>

              <P>(b) Any person in charge of a vessel or a facility shall, as soon as he or she has knowledge of any discharge from <PRTPAGE P="52"/>such vessel or facility in violation of section 311(b)(3) of the CWA, immediately notify the NRC. If direct reporting to the NRC is not practicable, reports may be made to the USCG or EPA predesignated OSC for the geographic area where the discharge occurs. The EPA predesignated OSC may also be contacted through the regional 24-hour emergency response telephone number. All such reports shall be promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify the NRC or predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made immediately to the nearest Coast Guard unit. In any event such person in charge of the vessel or facility shall notify the NRC as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(c) Any other person shall, as appropriate, notify the NRC of a discharge of oil.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon receipt of a notification of discharge, the NRC shall promptly notify the OSC. The OSC shall ensure notification of the appropriate state agency of any state which is, or may reasonably be expected to be, affected by the discharge. The OSC shall then proceed with the following phases as outlined in the RCP and ACP.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Phase II—Preliminary assessment and initiation of action.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The OSC is responsible for promptly initiating a preliminary assessment.</P>
              <P>(b) The preliminary assessment shall be conducted using available information, supplemented where necessary and possible by an on-scene inspection. The OSC shall undertake actions to:</P>
              <P>(1) Evaluate the magnitude and severity of the discharge or threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment;</P>
              <P>(2) Assess the feasibility of removal; and</P>
              <P>(3) To the extent practicable, identify potentially responsible parties.</P>
              <P>(c) Where practicable, the framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings together the functions of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC maintains authority.</P>
              <P>(d) Except in a case when the OSC is required to direct the response to a discharge that may pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States (including but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC may allow the responsible party to voluntarily and promptly perform removal actions, provided the OSC determines such actions will ensure an effective and immediate removal of the discharge or mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a discharge. If the responsible party does conduct the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever actions are initiated. If effective actions are not being taken to eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable, continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible parties.</P>
              <P>(1) In carrying out a response under this section, the OSC may:</P>
              <P>(i) Remove or arrange for the removal of a discharge, and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of a discharge, at any time;</P>
              <P>(ii) Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a discharge; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.</P>

              <P>(2) If the discharge results in a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC must direct all response efforts, as provided in § 300.322(b) of this part. The OSC should declare as expeditiously as practicable to spill response participants that the federal government will <PRTPAGE P="53"/>direct the response. The OSC may act without regard to any other provision of the law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government in removing or arranging for the removal of such a discharge.</P>

              <P>(e) The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are promptly notified in the event of any discharge of oil, to the maximum extent practicable as provided in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex to the ACP for the area in which the discharge occurs. The OSC and the trustees shall coordinate assessments, evaluations, investigations, and planning with respect to appropriate removal actions. The OSC shall consult with the affected trustees on the appropriate removal action to be taken. The trustees will provide timely advice concerning recommended actions with regard to trustee resources potentially affected. The trustees also will assure that the OSC is informed of their activities in natural resource damage assessment that may affect response operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment activities that may support more effective operational decisions are provided in a timely manner to the OSC. When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of non-monetary response resources (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, personnel and equipment) with the trustees, provided trustee activities do not interfere with response actions. The lead administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also responsible for applying to the NPFC for funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural resources.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Phase III—Containment, countermeasures, cleanup, and disposal.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Defensive actions shall begin as soon as possible to prevent, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to the public health or welfare of the United States or the environment. Actions may include but are not limited to: Analyzing water samples to determine the source and spread of the oil; controlling the source of discharge; measuring and sampling; source and spread control or salvage operations; placement of physical barriers to deter the spread of the oil and to protect natural resources and sensitive ecosystems; control of the water discharged from upstream impoundment; and the use of chemicals and other materials in accordance with subpart J of this part to restrain the spread of the oil and mitigate its effects. The ACP prepared under § 300.210(c) should be consulted for procedures to be followed for obtaining an expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants and other products listed on the NCP Product Schedule.</P>
              <P>(b) As appropriate, actions shall be taken to recover the oil or mitigate its effects. Of the numerous chemical or physical methods that may be used, the chosen methods shall be the most consistent with protecting public health and welfare and the environment. Sinking agents shall not be used.</P>

              <P>(c) Oil and contaminated materials recovered in cleanup operations shall be disposed of in accordance with the RCP, ACP, and any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements. RRT and Area Committee guidelines may identify the disposal options available during an oil spill response and may describe what disposal requirements are mandatory or may not be waived by the OSC. ACP guidelines should address: the sampling, testing, and classifying of recovered oil and oiled debris; the segregation, temporary storage, and stockpiling of recovered oil and oiled debris; prior state disposal approvals and permits; and the routes; methods (e.g. recycle/reuse, on-site burning, incineration, landfilling, etc.); and sites for the disposal of collected oil, oiled debris, and animal carcasses; and procedures for obtaining waivers, exemptions, or authorizations associated with handling or transporting waste materials. The ACPs may identify a hierarchy of preferences for disposal alternatives, with recycling (reprocessing) being the most preferred, and other alternatives preferred based <PRTPAGE P="54"/>on priorities for health or the environment.</P>

              <P>(a) All OSLTF users need to collect and maintain documentation to support all actions taken under the CWA. In general, documentation shall be sufficient to support full cost recovery for resources utilized and shall identify the source and circumstances of the incident, the responsible party or parties, and impacts and potential impacts to public health and welfare and the environment. Documentation procedures are contained in 33 CFR part 136.</P>
              <P>(b) When appropriate, documentation shall also be collected for scientific understanding of the environment and for research and development of improved response methods and technology. Funding for these actions is restricted by section 6002 of the OPA.</P>
              <P>(c) OSCs shall submit OSC reports to the NRT or RRT, only if requested, as provided by § 300.165.</P>
              <P>(d) OSCs shall ensure the necessary collection and safeguarding of information, samples, and reports. Samples and information shall be gathered expeditiously during the response to ensure an accurate record of the impacts incurred. Documentation materials shall be made available to the trustees of affected natural resources. The OSC shall make available to trustees of the affected natural resources information and documentation in the OSC's possession that can assist the trustees in the determination of actual or potential natural resource injuries.</P>
              <P>(e) Information and reports obtained by the EPA or USCG OSC shall be transmitted to the appropriate offices responsible for follow-up actions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>National response priorities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Safety of human life must be given the top priority during every response action. This includes any search and rescue efforts in the general proximity of the discharge and the insurance of safety of response personnel.</P>
              <P>(b) Stabilizing the situation to preclude the event from worsening is the next priority. All efforts must be focused on saving a vessel that has been involved in a grounding, collision, fire, or explosion, so that it does not compound the problem. Comparable measures should be taken to stabilize a situation involving a facility, pipeline, or other source of pollution. Stabilizing the situation includes securing the source of the spill and/or removing the remaining oil from the container (vessel, tank, or pipeline) to prevent additional oil spillage, to reduce the need for follow-up response action, and to minimize adverse impact to the environment.</P>
              <P>(c) The response must use all necessary containment and removal tactics in a coordinated manner to ensure a timely, effective response that minimizes adverse impact to the environment.</P>
              <P>(d) All parts of this national response strategy should be addressed concurrently, but safety and stabilization are the highest priorities. The OSC should not delay containment and removal decisions unnecessarily and should take actions to minimize adverse impact to the environment that begins as soon as a discharge occurs, as well as actions to minimize further adverse environmental impact from additional discharges.</P>
              <P>(e) The priorities set forth in this section are broad in nature, and should not be interpreted to preclude the consideration of other priorities that may arise on a site-specific basis.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General pattern of response.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When the OSC receives a report of a discharge, actions normally should be taken in the following sequence:</P>
              <P>(1) Investigate the report to determine pertinent information such as the threat posed to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment, the type and quantity of polluting material, and the source of the discharge.</P>
              <P>(2) Officially classify the size (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, minor, medium, major) and type (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States, worst case discharge) of the discharge and determine the course of action to be followed to ensure effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or prevention of the discharge. Some discharges that are classified as a substantial threat to the public health or welfare <PRTPAGE P="55"/>of the United States may be further classified as a spill of national significance by the Administrator of EPA or the Commandant of the USCG. The appropriate course of action may be prescribed in §§ 300.322, 300.323, and 300.324.</P>
              <P>(i) When the reported discharge is an actual or potential major discharge, the OSC shall immediately notify the RRT and the NRC.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential medium discharge exists, the OSC shall recommend activation of the RRT, if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(iii) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential minor discharge exists, the OSC shall monitor the situation to ensure that proper removal action is being taken.</P>
              <P>(3) If the OSC determines that effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or prevention of a discharge can be achieved by private party efforts, and where the discharge does not pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States, determine whether the responsible party or other person is properly carrying out removal. Removal is being done properly when:</P>
              <P>(i) The responsible party is applying the resources called for in its response plan to effectively and immediately remove, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to public health and welfare and the environment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The removal efforts are in accordance with applicable regulations, including the NCP. Even if the OSC supplements responsible party resources with government resources, the spill response will not be considered improper, unless specifically determined by the OSC.</P>
              <P>(4) Where appropriate, determine whether a state or political subdivision thereof has the capability to carry out any or all removal actions. If so, the OSC may arrange funding to support these actions.</P>
              <P>(5) Ensure prompt notification of the trustees of affected natural resources in accordance with the applicable RCP and ACP.</P>
              <P>(b) Removal shall be considered complete when so determined by the OSC in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected states. When the OSC considers removal complete, OSLTF removal funding shall end. This determination shall not preclude additional removal actions under applicable state law.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Response to substantial threats to public health or welfare of the United States.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As part of the investigation described in § 300.320, the OSC shall determine whether a discharge results in a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States). Factors to be considered by the OSC in making this determination include, but are not limited to, the size of the discharge, the character of the discharge, and the nature of the threat to public health or welfare of the United States. Upon obtaining such information, the OSC shall conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's experience in assessing other discharges, and consultation with senior lead agency officials and readily available authorities on issues outside the OSC's technical expertise.</P>
              <P>(b) If the investigation by the OSC shows that the discharge poses or may present a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a discharge, as appropriate. In directing the response in such cases, the OSC may act without regard to any other provision of law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government to:</P>
              <P>(1) Remove or arrange for the removal of the discharge;</P>
              <P>(2) Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the discharge; and</P>
              <P>(3) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.</P>

              <P>(c) In the case of a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall:<PRTPAGE P="56"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and other assistance described in § 300.145, including the use of the services of the NSFCC, as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(2) Request immediate activation of the RRT; and</P>
              <P>(3) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate, including, but not limited to, implementation of the ACP as required by section 311(j)(4) of the CWA or relevant tank vessel or facility response plan required by section 311(j)(5) of the CWA. When requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall dispatch appropriate personnel to the scene of the discharge to assist the OSC. This assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas of expertise and disseminating information to the public. The lead agency shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on scene, at the request of the OSC.</P>

              <P>(a) This subpart establishes methods and criteria for determining the appropriate extent of response authorized by CERCLA and CWA section 311(c):</P>
              <P>(1) When there is a release of a hazardous substance into the environment; or</P>
              <P>(2) When there is a release into the environment of any pollutant or contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare of the United States.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations on response.</E> Unless the lead agency determines that a release constitutes a public health or environmental emergency and no other person with the authority and capability to respond will do so in a timely manner, a removal or remedial action under section 104 of CERCLA shall not be undertaken in response to a release:</P>
              <P>(1) Of a naturally occurring substance in its unaltered form, or altered solely through naturally occurring processes or phenomena, from a location where it is naturally found;</P>
              <P>(2) From products that are part of the structure of, and result in exposure within, residential buildings or business or community structures; or</P>
              <P>(3) Into public or private drinking water supplies due to deterioration of the system through ordinary use.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fund-financed action.</E> In determining the need for and in planning or undertaking Fund-financed action, the lead agency shall, to the extent practicable:</P>
              <P>(1) Engage in prompt response;</P>
              <P>(2) Provide for state participation in response actions, as described in subpart F of this part;</P>
              <P>(3) Conserve Fund monies by encouraging private party response;</P>
              <P>(4) Be sensitive to local community concerns;</P>
              <P>(5) Consider using treatment technologies;</P>
              <P>(6) Involve the Regional Response Team (RRT) in both removal and remedial response actions at appropriate decision-making stages;</P>
              <P>(7) Encourage the involvement and sharing of technology by industry and other experts; and</P>
              <P>(8) Encourage the involvement of organizations to coordinate responsible party actions, foster site response, and provide technical advice to the public, federal and state governments, and industry.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Entry and access.</E> (1) For purposes of determining the need for response, or choosing or taking a response action, or otherwise enforcing the provisions of CERCLA, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, and a state or political subdivision operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement under CERCLA section 104(d)(1), has the authority to enter any vessel, facility, establishment or other place, property, or location described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and conduct, complete, operate, and maintain any <PRTPAGE P="58"/>response actions authorized by CERCLA or these regulations.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Under the authorities described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, and a state or political subdivision operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement under CERCLA section 104(d)(1), may enter:</P>
              <P>(A) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property where any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant may be or has been generated, stored, treated, disposed of, or transported from;</P>
              <P>(B) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property from which, or to which, a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant has been, or may have been, released or where such release is or may be threatened;</P>
              <P>(C) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place or property where entry is necessary to determine the need for response or the appropriate response or to effectuate a response action; or</P>
              <P>(D) Any vessel, facility, establishment, or other place, property, or location adjacent to those vessels, facilities, establishments, places, or properties described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Once a determination has been made that there is a reasonable basis to believe that there has been or may be a release, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, and a state or political subdivision operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement under CERCLA section 104(d)(1), is authorized to enter all vessels, facilities, establishments, places, properties, or locations specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, at which the release is believed to be, and all other vessels, facilities, establishments, places, properties, or locations identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that are related to the response or are necessary to enter in responding to that release.</P>
              <P>(3) The lead agency may designate as its representative solely for the purpose of access, among others, one or more potentially responsible parties, including representatives, employees, agents, and contractors of such parties. EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, may exercise the authority contained in section 104(e) of CERCLA to obtain access for its designated representative. A potentially responsible party may only be designated as a representative of the lead agency where that potentially responsible party has agreed to conduct response activities pursuant to an administrative order or consent decree.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) If consent is not granted under the authorities described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or if consent is conditioned in any manner, EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, may issue an order pursuant to section 104(e)(5) of CERCLA directing compliance with the request for access made under § 300.400(d)(1). EPA or the appropriate federal agency may ask the Attorney General to commence a civil action to compel compliance with either a request for access or an order directing compliance.</P>
              <P>(ii) EPA reserves the right to proceed, where appropriate, under applicable authority other than CERCLA section 104(e).</P>
              <P>(iii) The administrative order may direct compliance with a request to enter or inspect any vessel, facility, establishment, place, property, or location described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) Each order shall contain:</P>
              <P>(A) A determination by EPA, or the appropriate federal agency, that it is reasonable to believe that there may be or has been a release or threat of a release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant and a statement of the facts upon which the determination is based;</P>
              <P>(B) A description, in light of CERCLA response authorities, of the purpose and estimated scope and duration of the entry, including a description of the specific anticipated activities to be conducted pursuant to the order;</P>
              <P>(C) A provision advising the person who failed to consent that an officer or employee of the agency that issued the order will be available to confer with respondent prior to effective date of the order; and</P>

              <P>(D) A provision advising the person who failed to consent that a court may impose a penalty of up to $25,000 per <PRTPAGE P="59"/>day for unreasonable failure to comply with the order.</P>
              <P>(v) Orders shall be served upon the person or responsible party who failed to consent prior to their effective date. Force shall not be used to compel compliance with an order.</P>
              <P>(vi) Orders may not be issued for any criminal investigations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Permit requirements.</E> (1) No federal, state, or local permits are required for on-site response actions conducted pursuant to CERCLA sections 104, 106, 120, 121, or 122. The term <E T="03">on-site</E> means the areal extent of contamination and all suitable areas in very close proximity to the contamination necessary for implementation of the response action.</P>
              <P>(2) Permits, if required, shall be obtained for all response activities conducted off-site.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Health assessments.</E> Health assessments shall be performed by ATSDR at facilities on or proposed to be listed on the NPL and may be performed at other releases or facilities in response to petitions made to ATSDR. Where available, these health assessments may be used by the lead agency to assist in determining whether response actions should be taken and/or to identify the need for additional studies to assist in the assessment of potential human health effects associated with releases or potential releases of hazardous substances.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Identification of applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements.</E> (1) The lead and support agencies shall identify requirements applicable to the release or remedial action contemplated based upon an objective determination of whether the requirement specifically addresses a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, remedial action, location, or other circumstance found at a CERCLA site.</P>
              <P>(2) If, based upon paragraph (g)(1) of this section, it is determined that a requirement is not applicable to a specific release, the requirement may still be relevant and appropriate to the circumstances of the release. In evaluating relevance and appropriateness, the factors in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (viii) of this section shall be examined, where pertinent, to determine whether a requirement addresses problems or situations sufficiently similar to the circumstances of the release or remedial action contemplated, and whether the requirement is well-suited to the site, and therefore is both relevant and appropriate. The pertinence of each of the following factors will depend, in part, on whether a requirement addresses a chemical, location, or action. The following comparisons shall be made, where pertinent, to determine relevance and appropriateness:</P>
              <P>(i) The purpose of the requirement and the purpose of the CERCLA action;</P>
              <P>(ii) The medium regulated or affected by the requirement and the medium contaminated or affected at the CERCLA site;</P>
              <P>(iii) The substances regulated by the requirement and the substances found at the CERCLA site;</P>
              <P>(iv) The actions or activities regulated by the requirement and the remedial action contemplated at the CERCLA site;</P>
              <P>(v) Any variances, waivers, or exemptions of the requirement and their availability for the circumstances at the CERCLA site;</P>
              <P>(vi) The type of place regulated and the type of place affected by the release or CERCLA action;</P>
              <P>(vii) The type and size of structure or facility regulated and the type and size of structure or facility affected by the release or contemplated by the CERCLA action;</P>
              <P>(viii) Any consideration of use or potential use of affected resources in the requirement and the use or potential use of the affected resource at the CERCLA site.</P>
              <P>(3) In addition to applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements, the lead and support agencies may, as appropriate, identify other advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered for a particular release. The “to be considered” (TBC) category consists of advisories, criteria, or guidance that were developed by EPA, other federal agencies, or states that may be useful in developing CERCLA remedies.</P>

              <P>(4) Only those state standards that are promulgated, are identified by the state in a timely manner, and are more stringent than federal requirements <PRTPAGE P="60"/>may be applicable or relevant and appropriate. For purposes of identification and notification of promulgated state standards, the term <E T="03">promulgated</E> means that the standards are of general applicability and are legally enforceable.</P>
              <P>(5) The lead agency and support agency shall identify their specific requirements that are applicable or relevant and appropriate for a particular site. These agencies shall notify each other, in a timely manner as described in § 300.515(d), of the requirements they have determined to be applicable or relevant and appropriate. When identifying a requirement as an ARAR, the lead agency and support agency shall include a citation to the statute or regulation from which the requirement is derived.</P>
              <P>(6) Notification of ARARs shall be according to procedures and timeframes specified in § 300.515 (d)(2) and (h)(2).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Oversight.</E> The lead agency may provide oversight for actions taken by potentially responsible parties to ensure that a response is conducted consistent with this part. The lead agency may also monitor the actions of third parties preauthorized under subpart H of this part. EPA will provide oversight when the response is pursuant to an EPA order or federal consent decree.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Other.</E> (1) This subpart does not establish any preconditions to enforcement action by either the federal or state governments to compel response actions by potentially responsible parties.</P>
              <P>(2) While much of this subpart is oriented toward federally funded response actions, this subpart may be used as guidance concerning methods and criteria for response actions by other parties under other funding mechanisms. Except as provided in subpart H of this part, nothing in this part is intended to limit the rights of any person to seek recovery of response costs from responsible parties pursuant to CERCLA section 107.</P>
              <P>(3) Activities by the federal and state governments in implementing this subpart are discretionary governmental functions. This subpart does not create in any private party a right to federal response or enforcement action. This subpart does not create any duty of the federal government to take any response action at any particular time.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Discovery or notification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A release may be discovered through:</P>

              <P>(1) A report submitted in accordance with section 103(a) of CERCLA, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, reportable quantities codified at 40 CFR part 302;</P>
              <P>(2) A report submitted to EPA in accordance with section 103(c) of CERCLA;</P>
              <P>(3) Investigation by government authorities conducted in accordance with section 104(e) of CERCLA or other statutory authority;</P>
              <P>(4) Notification of a release by a federal or state permit holder when required by its permit;</P>
              <P>(5) Inventory or survey efforts or random or incidental observation reported by government agencies or the public;</P>
              <P>(6) Submission of a citizen petition to EPA or the appropriate federal facility requesting a preliminary assessment, in accordance with section 105(d) of CERCLA;</P>
              <P>(7) A report submitted in accordance with section 311(b)(5) of the CWA; and</P>
              <P>(8) Other sources.</P>
              <P>(b) Any person in charge of a vessel or a facility shall report releases as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the National Response Center (NRC). If direct reporting to the NRC is not practicable, reports may be made to the United States Coast Guard (USCG) on-scene coordinator (OSC) for the geographic area where the release occurs. The EPA predesignated OSC may also be contacted through the regional 24-hour emergency response telephone number. All such reports shall be promptly relayed to the NRC. If it is not possible to notify the NRC or predesignated OSC immediately, reports may be made immediately to the nearest USCG unit. In any event, such person in charge of the vessel or facility shall notify the NRC as soon as possible.</P>

              <P>(c) All other reports of releases described under paragraph (a) of this section, except releases reported under paragraphs (a)(2) and (6) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="61"/>shall, as appropriate, be made to the NRC.</P>
              <P>(d) The NRC will generally need information that will help to characterize the release. This will include, but not be limited to: Location of the release; type(s) of material(s) released; an estimate of the quantity of material released; possible source of the release; and date and time of the release. Reporting under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not be delayed due to incomplete notification information.</P>
              <P>(e) Upon receipt of a notification of a release, the NRC shall promptly notify the appropriate OSC. The OSC shall notify the Governor, or designee, of the state affected by the release.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) When the OSC is notified of a release that may require response pursuant to § 300.415(b), a removal site evaluation shall, as appropriate, be promptly undertaken pursuant to § 300.410.</P>
              <P>(2) When notification indicates that removal action pursuant to § 300.415(b) is not required, a remedial site evaluation shall, if appropriate, be undertaken by the lead agency pursuant to § 300.420, if one has not already been performed.</P>
              <P>(3) If radioactive substances are present in a release, the EPA Radiological Response Coordinator should be notified for evaluation and assistance either directly or via the NRC, consistent with §§ 300.130(e) and 300.145(f).</P>
              <P>(g) Release notification made to the NRC under this section does not relieve the owner/operator of a facility from any obligations to which it is subject under SARA Title III or state law. In particular, it does not relieve the owner/operator from the requirements of section 304 of SARA Title III and 40 CFR part 355 and § 300.215(f) of this part for notifying the community emergency coordinator for the appropriate local emergency planning committee of all affected areas and the state emergency response commission of any state affected that there has been a release. Federal agencies are not legally obligated to comply with the requirements of Title III of SARA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Removal site evaluation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A removal site evaluation includes a removal preliminary assessment and, if warranted, a removal site inspection.</P>
              <P>(b) A removal site evaluation of a release identified for possible CERCLA response pursuant to § 300.415 shall, as appropriate, be undertaken by the lead agency as promptly as possible. The lead agency may perform a removal preliminary assessment in response to petitions submitted by a person who is, or may be, affected by a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant pursuant to § 300.420(b)(5).</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The lead agency shall, as appropriate, base the removal preliminary assessment on readily available information. A removal preliminary assessment may include, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Identification of the source and nature of the release or threat of release;</P>
              <P>(ii) Evaluation by ATSDR or by other sources, for example, state public health agencies, of the threat to public health;</P>
              <P>(iii) Evaluation of the magnitude of the threat;</P>
              <P>(iv) Evaluation of factors necessary to make the determination of whether a removal is necessary; and</P>
              <P>(v) Determination of whether a nonfederal party is undertaking proper response.</P>
              <P>(2) A removal preliminary assessment of releases from hazardous waste management facilities may include collection or review of data such as site management practices, information from generators, photographs, analysis of historical photographs, literature searches, and personal interviews conducted, as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(d) A removal site inspection may be performed if more information is needed. Such inspection may include a perimeter (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, off-site) or on-site inspection, taking into consideration whether such inspection can be performed safely.</P>

              <P>(e)(1) As part of the evaluation under this section, the OSC shall determine whether a release governed by CWA section 311(c)(1), as amended by OPA section 4201(a), has occurred.<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If such a release of a CWA hazardous substance has occurred, the OSC shall determine whether the release results in a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States. Factors to be considered by the OSC in making this determination include, but are not limited to, the size of the release, the character of the release, and the nature of the threat to public health or welfare of the United States. Upon obtaining relevant elements of such information, the OSC shall conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's experience in assessing other releases, and consultation with senior lead agency officials and readily available authorities on issues outside the OSC's technical expertise.</P>
              <P>(f) A removal site evaluation shall be terminated when the OSC or lead agency determines:</P>
              <P>(1) There is no release;</P>
              <P>(2) The source is neither a vessel nor a facility as defined in § 300.5 of the NCP;</P>
              <P>(3) The release involves neither a hazardous substance, nor a pollutant or contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare of the United States;</P>
              <P>(4) The release consists of a situation specified in § 300.400(b)(1) through (3) subject to limitations on response;</P>
              <P>(5) The amount, quantity, or concentration released does not warrant federal response;</P>
              <P>(6) A party responsible for the release, or any other person, is providing appropriate response, and on-scene monitoring by the government is not required; or</P>
              <P>(7) The removal site evaluation is completed.</P>
              <P>(g) The results of the removal site evaluation shall be documented.</P>
              <P>(h) The OSC or lead agency shall ensure that natural resource trustees are promptly notified in order that they may initiate appropriate actions, including those identified in subpart G of this part. The OSC or lead agency shall coordinate all response activities with such affected trustees.</P>
              <P>(i) If the removal site evaluation indicates that removal action under § 300.415 is not required, but that remedial action under § 300.430 may be necessary, the lead agency shall, as appropriate, initiate a remedial site evaluation pursuant to § 300.420.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Removal action.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) In determining the appropriate extent of action to be taken in response to a given release, the lead agency shall first review the removal site evaluation, any information produced through a remedial site evaluation, if any has been done previously, and the current site conditions, to determine if removal action is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the responsible parties are known, an effort initially shall be made, to the extent practicable, to determine whether they can and will perform the necessary removal action promptly and properly.</P>
              <P>(3) This section does not apply to removal actions taken pursuant to section 104(b) of CERCLA. The criteria for such actions are set forth in section 104(b) of CERCLA.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) At any release, regardless of whether the site is included on the National Priorities List (NPL), where the lead agency makes the determination, based on the factors in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that there is a threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment, the lead agency may take any appropriate removal action to abate, prevent, minimize, stabilize, mitigate, or eliminate the release or the threat of release.</P>
              <P>(2) The following factors shall be considered in determining the appropriateness of a removal action pursuant to this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Actual or potential exposure to nearby human populations, animals, or the food chain from hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants;</P>
              <P>(ii) Actual or potential contamination of drinking water supplies or sensitive ecosystems;</P>
              <P>(iii) Hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants in drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk storage containers, that may pose a threat of release;</P>

              <P>(iv) High levels of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants <PRTPAGE P="63"/>in soils largely at or near the surface, that may migrate;</P>
              <P>(v) Weather conditions that may cause hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants to migrate or be released;</P>
              <P>(vi) Threat of fire or explosion;</P>
              <P>(vii) The availability of other appropriate federal or state response mechanisms to respond to the release; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Other situations or factors that may pose threats to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment.</P>
              <P>(3) If the lead agency determines that a removal action is appropriate, actions shall, as appropriate, begin as soon as possible to abate, prevent, minimize, stabilize, mitigate, or eliminate the threat to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment. The lead agency shall, at the earliest possible time, also make any necessary determinations pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever a planning period of at least six months exists before on-site activities must be initiated, and the lead agency determines, based on a site evaluation, that a removal action is appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) The lead agency shall conduct an engineering evaluation/cost analysis (EE/CA) or its equivalent. The EE/CA is an analysis of removal alternatives for a site.</P>
              <P>(ii) If environmental samples are to be collected, the lead agency shall develop sampling and analysis plans that shall provide a process for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy data needs. Sampling and analysis plans shall be reviewed and approved by EPA. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of two parts:</P>
              <P>(A) The field sampling plan, which describes the number, type, and location of samples and the type of analyses; and</P>
              <P>(B) The quality assurance project plan, which describes policy, organization, and functional activities and the data quality objectives and measures necessary to achieve adequate data for use in planning and documenting the removal action.</P>
              <P>(5) CERCLA fund-financed removal actions, other than those authorized under section 104(b) of CERCLA, shall be terminated after $2 million has been obligated for the action or 12 months have elapsed from the date that removal activities begin on-site, unless the lead agency determines that:</P>
              <P>(i) There is an immediate risk to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment; continued response actions are immediately required to prevent, limit, or mitigate an emergency; and such assistance will not otherwise be provided on a timely basis; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Continued response action is otherwise appropriate and consistent with the remedial action to be taken.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) In carrying out a response to a release of a CWA hazardous substance, as described in CWA section 311(c)(1), as amended by OPA section 4201(a), the OSC may:</P>
              <P>(i) Remove or arrange for the removal of a release, and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of a release, at any time;</P>
              <P>(ii) Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a release; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel releasing or threatening to release CWA hazardous substances, by whatever means are available.</P>
              <P>(2) If the investigation by the OSC under § 300.410 shows that the release of a CWA hazardous substance results in a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the release or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a release, as appropriate. In directing the response, the OSC may act without regard to any other provision of law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government to:</P>
              <P>(i) Remove or arrange for the removal of the release;</P>
              <P>(ii) Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the release; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel releasing, or threatening to release, by whatever means are available.</P>

              <P>(3) In the case of a release of a CWA hazardous substance posing a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall:<PRTPAGE P="64"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and other assistance described in § 300.145, as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(ii) Request immediate activation of the RRT; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate. When requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall dispatch appropriate personnel to the scene of the release to assist the OSC. This assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas of expertise and disseminating information to the public in accordance with § 300.155. The lead agency shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on-scene, at the request of the OSC.</P>
              <P>(d) Removal actions shall, to the extent practicable, contribute to the efficient performance of any anticipated long-term remedial action with respect to the release concerned.</P>
              <P>(e) The following removal actions are, as a general rule, appropriate in the types of situations shown; however, this list is not exhaustive and is not intended to prevent the lead agency from taking any other actions deemed necessary under CERCLA, CWA section 311, or other appropriate federal or state enforcement or response authorities, and the list does not create a duty on the lead agency to take action at any particular time:</P>
              <P>(1) Fences, warning signs, or other security or site control precautions—where humans or animals have access to the release;</P>
              <P>(2) Drainage controls, for example, run-off or run-on diversion—where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants off-site or to prevent precipitation or run-off from other sources, for example, flooding, from entering the release area from other areas;</P>
              <P>(3) Stabilization of berms, dikes, or impoundments or drainage or closing of lagoons—where needed to maintain the integrity of the structures;</P>
              <P>(4) Capping of contaminated soils or sludges—where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants into soil, ground or surface water, or air;</P>
              <P>(5) Using chemicals and other materials to retard the spread of the release or to mitigate its effects—where the use of such chemicals will reduce the spread of the release;</P>
              <P>(6) Excavation, consolidation, or removal of highly contaminated soils from drainage or other areas—where such actions will reduce the spread of, or direct contact with, the contamination;</P>
              <P>(7) Removal of drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk containers that contain or may contain hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants—where it will reduce the likelihood of spillage; leakage; exposure to humans, animals, or food chain; or fire or explosion;</P>
              <P>(8) Containment, treatment, disposal, or incineration of hazardous materials—where needed to reduce the likelihood of human, animal, or food chain exposure; or</P>
              <P>(9) Provision of alternative water supply—where necessary immediately to reduce exposure to contaminated household water and continuing until such time as local authorities can satisfy the need for a permanent remedy.</P>
              <P>(f) Where necessary to protect public health or welfare, the lead agency shall request that FEMA conduct a temporary relocation or that state/local officials conduct an evacuation.</P>
              <P>(g) If the lead agency determines that the removal action will not fully address the threat posed by the release and the release may require remedial action, the lead agency shall ensure an orderly transition from removal to remedial response activities.</P>
              <P>(h) CERCLA removal actions conducted by states under cooperative agreements, described in subpart F of this part, shall comply with all requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Facilities operated by a state or political subdivision at the time of disposal require a state cost share of at least 50 percent of Fund-financed response costs if a Fund-financed remedial action is conducted.</P>

              <P>(j) Fund-financed removal actions under CERCLA section 104 and removal actions pursuant to CERCLA section 106 shall, to the extent practicable considering the exigencies of the situation, attain applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) under <PRTPAGE P="65"/>federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws. Waivers described in § 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C) may be used for removal actions. Other federal and state advisories, criteria, or guidance may, as appropriate, be considered in formulating the removal action (see § 300.400(g)(3)). In determining whether compliance with ARARs is practicable, the lead agency may consider appropriate factors, including:</P>
              <P>(1) The urgency of the situation; and</P>
              <P>(2) The scope of the removal action to be conducted.</P>
              <P>(k) Removal actions pursuant to section 106 or 122 of CERCLA are not subject to the following requirements of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Section 300.415(a)(2) requirement to locate responsible parties and have them undertake the response;</P>
              <P>(2) Section 300.415(b)(2)(vii) requirement to consider the availability of other appropriate federal or state response and enforcement mechanisms to respond to the release;</P>
              <P>(3) Section 300.415(b)(5) requirement to terminate response after $2 million has been obligated or 12 months have elapsed from the date of the initial response; and</P>
              <P>(4) Section 300.415(g) requirement to assure an orderly transition from removal to remedial action.</P>
              <P>(l) To the extent practicable, provision for post-removal site control following a CERCLA Fund-financed removal action at both NPL and non-NPL sites is encouraged to be made prior to the initiation of the removal action. Such post-removal site control includes actions necessary to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of the removal action after the completion of the on-site removal action or after the $2 million or 12-month statutory limits are reached for sites that do not meet the exemption criteria in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Post-removal site control may be conducted by:</P>
              <P>(1) The affected state or political subdivision thereof or local units of government for any removal;</P>
              <P>(2) Potentially responsible parties; or</P>
              <P>(3) EPA's remedial program for some federal-lead Fund-financed responses at NPL sites.</P>
              <P>(m) OSCs/RPMs conducting removal actions shall submit OSC reports to the RRT as required by § 300.165.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Community relations in removal actions.</E> (1) In the case of all CERCLA removal actions taken pursuant to § 300.415 or CERCLA enforcement actions to compel removal response, a spokesperson shall be designated by the lead agency. The spokesperson shall inform the community of actions taken, respond to inquiries, and provide information concerning the release. All news releases or statements made by participating agencies shall be coordinated with the OSC/RPM. The spokesperson shall notify, at a minimum, immediately affected citizens, state and local officials, and, when appropriate, civil defense or emergency management agencies.</P>
              <P>(2) For CERCLA actions where, based on the site evaluation, the lead agency determines that a removal is appropriate, and that less than six months exists before on-site removal activity must begin, the lead agency shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Publish a notice of availability of the administrative record file established pursuant to § 300.820 in a major local newspaper of general circulation or use one or more other mechanisms to give adequate notice to a community within 60 days of initiation of on-site removal activity;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide a public comment period, as appropriate, of not less than 30 days from the time the administrative record file is made available for public inspection, pursuant to § 300.820(b)(2); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Prepare a written response to significant comments pursuant to § 300.820(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(3) For CERCLA removal actions where on-site action is expected to extend beyond 120 days from the initiation of on-site removal activities, the lead agency shall by the end of the 120-day period:</P>

              <P>(i) Conduct interviews with local officials, community residents, public interest groups, or other interested or affected parties, as appropriate, to solicit their concerns, information needs, and how or when citizens would like to be involved in the Superfund process;<PRTPAGE P="66"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Prepare a formal community relations plan (CRP) based on the community interviews and other relevant information, specifying the community relations activities that the lead agency expects to undertake during the response; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Establish at least one local information repository at or near the location of the response action. The information repository should contain items made available for public information. Further, an administrative record file established pursuant to subpart I for all removal actions shall be available for public inspection in at least one of the repositories. The lead agency shall inform the public of the establishment of the information repository and provide notice of availability of the administrative record file for public review. All items in the repository shall be available for public inspection and copying.</P>
              <P>(4) Where, based on the site evaluation, the lead agency determines that a CERCLA removal action is appropriate and that a planning period of at least six months exists prior to initiation of the on-site removal activities, the lead agency shall at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(i) Comply with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (n)(3)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, prior to the completion of the EE/CA, or its equivalent, except that the information repository and the administrative record file will be established no later than when the EE/CA approval memorandum is signed;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The purpose of this section is to describe the methods, procedures, and criteria the lead agency shall use to collect data, as required, and evaluate releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. The evaluation may consist of two steps: a remedial preliminary assessment (PA) and a remedial site inspection (SI).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Remedial preliminary assessment.</E> (1) The lead agency shall perform a remedial PA on all sites entered into the SEMS remedial assessment active inventory as defined in § 300.5 to:</P>
              <P>(i) Eliminate from further consideration those sites that pose no threat to public health or the environment;</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine if there is any potential need for removal action;</P>
              <P>(iii) Set priorities for site inspections; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Gather existing data to facilitate later evaluation of the release pursuant to the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) if warranted.</P>
              <P>(2) A remedial PA shall consist of a review of existing information about a release such as information on the pathways of exposure, exposure targets, and source and nature of release. A remedial PA shall also include an off-site reconnaissance as appropriate. A remedial PA may include an on-site reconnaissance where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) If the remedial PA indicates that a removal action may be warranted, the lead agency shall initiate removal evaluation pursuant to § 300.410.</P>
              <P>(4) In performing a remedial PA, the lead agency may complete the EPA Preliminary Assessment form, available from EPA regional offices, or its equivalent, and shall prepare a PA report, which shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the release;</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of the probable nature of the release; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A recommendation on whether further action is warranted, which lead agency should conduct further action, and whether an SI or removal action or both should be undertaken.</P>

              <P>(5) Any person may petition the lead federal agency (EPA or the appropriate federal agency in the case of a release or suspected release from a federal facility), to perform a PA of a release <PRTPAGE P="67"/>when such person is, or may be, affected by a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Such petitions shall be addressed to the EPA Regional Administrator for the region in which the release is located, except that petitions for PAs involving federal facilities should be addressed to the head of the appropriate federal agency.</P>
              <P>(i) Petitions shall be signed by the petitioner and shall contain the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The full name, address, and phone number of petitioner;</P>
              <P>(B) A description, as precisely as possible, of the location of the release; and</P>
              <P>(C) How the petitioner is or may be affected by the release.</P>
              <P>(ii) Petitions should also contain the following information to the extent available:</P>
              <P>(A) What type of substances were or may be released;</P>
              <P>(B) The nature of activities that have occurred where the release is located; and</P>
              <P>(C) Whether local and state authorities have been contacted about the release.</P>
              <P>(iii) The lead federal agency shall complete a remedial or removal PA within one year of the date of receipt of a complete petition pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, if one has not been performed previously, unless the lead federal agency determines that a PA is not appropriate. Where such a determination is made, the lead federal agency shall notify the petitioner and will provide a reason for the determination.</P>
              <P>(iv) When determining if performance of a PA is appropriate, the lead federal agency shall take into consideration:</P>
              <P>(A) Whether there is information indicating that a release has occurred or there is a threat of a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant; and</P>
              <P>(B) Whether the release is eligible for response under CERCLA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Remedial site inspection.</E> (1) The lead agency shall perform a remedial SI as appropriate to:</P>
              <P>(i) Eliminate from further consideration those releases that pose no significant threat to public health or the environment;</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine the potential need for removal action;</P>
              <P>(iii) Collect or develop additional data, as appropriate, to evaluate the release pursuant to the HRS; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Collect data in addition to that required to score the release pursuant to the HRS, as appropriate, to better characterize the release for more effective and rapid initiation of the RI/FS or response under other authorities.</P>
              <P>(2) The remedial SI shall build upon the information collected in the remedial PA. The remedial SI shall involve, as appropriate, both on- and off-site field investigatory efforts, and sampling.</P>
              <P>(3) If the remedial SI indicates that removal action may be appropriate, the lead agency shall initiate removal site evaluation pursuant to § 300.410.</P>
              <P>(4) Prior to conducting field sampling as part of site inspections, the lead agency shall develop sampling and analysis plans that shall provide a process for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy data needs. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of two parts:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Establishing remedial priorities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The purpose of this section is to identify the criteria as well as the methods and procedures EPA uses to establish its priorities for remedial actions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">National Priorities List.</E> The NPL is the list of priority releases for long-term remedial evaluation and response.</P>
              <P>(1) Only those releases included on the NPL shall be considered eligible for Fund-financed remedial action. Removal actions (including remedial planning activities, RI/FSs, and other actions taken pursuant to CERCLA section 104(b)) are not limited to NPL sites.</P>
              <P>(2) Inclusion of a release on the NPL does not imply that monies will be expended, nor does the rank of a release on the NPL establish the precise priorities for the allocation of Fund resources. EPA may also pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the release, including enforcement actions under CERCLA and other laws. A site's rank on the NPL serves, along with other factors, including enforcement actions, as a basis to guide the allocation of Fund resources among releases.</P>
              <P>(3) Federal facilities that meet the criteria identified in paragraph (c) of this section are eligible for inclusion on the NPL. Except as provided by CERCLA sections 111(e)(3) and 111(c), federal facilities are not eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions.</P>
              <P>(4) Inclusion on the NPL is not a precondition to action by the lead agency under CERCLA sections 106 or 122 or to action under CERCLA section 107 for recovery of non-Fund-financed costs or Fund-financed costs other than Fund-financed remedial construction costs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Methods for determining eligibility for NPL.</E> A release may be included on the NPL if the release meets one of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) The release scores sufficiently high pursuant to the Hazard Ranking System described in appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(2) A state (not including Indian tribes) has designated a release as its highest priority. States may make only one such designation; or</P>
              <P>(3) The release satisfies all of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has issued a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release;</P>
              <P>(ii) EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health; and</P>
              <P>(iii) EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to the release.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures for placing sites on the NPL.</E> Lead agencies may submit candidates to EPA by scoring the release using the HRS and providing the appropriate backup documentation.</P>
              <P>(1) Lead agencies may submit HRS scoring packages to EPA anytime throughout the year.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA shall review lead agencies' HRS scoring packages and revise them as appropriate. EPA shall develop any additional HRS scoring packages on releases known to EPA.</P>
              <P>(3) EPA shall compile the NPL based on the methods identified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) EPA shall update the NPL at least once a year.</P>
              <P>(5) To ensure public involvement during the proposal to add a release to the NPL, EPA shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Publish the proposed rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and solicit comments through a public comment period; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Publish the final rule in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and make available a response to each significant comment and any significant new data submitted during the comment period.</P>
              <P>(6) Releases may be categorized on the NPL when deemed appropriate by EPA.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Deletion from the NPL.</E> Releases may be deleted from or recategorized on the NPL where no further response is appropriate.</P>

              <P>(1) EPA shall consult with the state on proposed deletions from the NPL prior to developing the notice of intent to delete. In making a determination to delete a release from the NPL, EPA shall consider, in consultation with the state, whether any of the following criteria has been met:<PRTPAGE P="69"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required;</P>
              <P>(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implemented, and no further response action by responsible parties is appropriate; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate.</P>

              <P>(2) Releases shall not be deleted from the NPL until the state in which the release was located has concurred on the proposed deletion. EPA shall provide the state 30 working days for review of the deletion notice prior to its publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) All releases deleted from the NPL are eligible for further Fund-financed remedial actions should future conditions warrant such action. Whenever there is a significant release from a site deleted from the NPL, the site shall be restored to the NPL without application of the HRS.</P>
              <P>(4) To ensure public involvement during the proposal to delete a release from the NPL, EPA shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Publish a notice of intent to delete in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and solicit comment through a public comment period of a minimum of 30 calendar days;</P>
              <P>(ii) In a major local newspaper of general circulation at or near the release that is proposed for deletion, publish a notice of availability or use one or more other mechanisms to give adequate notice to a community of the intent to delete;</P>
              <P>(iii) Place copies of information supporting the proposed deletion in the information repository, described in § 300.430(c)(2)(iii), at or near the release proposed for deletion. These items shall be available for public inspection and copying; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Respond to each significant comment and any significant new data submitted during the comment period and include this response document in the final deletion package.</P>

              <P>(5) EPA shall place the final deletion package in the local information repository once the notice of final deletion has been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

              <SUBJECT>Remedial investigation/feasibility study and selection of remedy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General</E>—(1) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> The purpose of the remedy selection process is to implement remedies that eliminate, reduce, or control risks to human health and the environment. Remedial actions are to be implemented as soon as site data and information make it possible to do so. Accordingly, EPA has established the following program goal, expectations, and program management principles to assist in the identification and implementation of appropriate remedial actions.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Program goal.</E> The national goal of the remedy selection process is to select remedies that are protective of human health and the environment, that maintain protection over time, and that minimize untreated waste.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Program management principles.</E> EPA generally shall consider the following general principles of program management during the remedial process:</P>
              <P>(A) Sites should generally be remediated in operable units when early actions are necessary or appropriate to achieve significant risk reduction quickly, when phased analysis and response is necessary or appropriate given the size or complexity of the site, or to expedite the completion of total site cleanup.</P>
              <P>(B) Operable units, including interim action operable units, should not be inconsistent with nor preclude implementation of the expected final remedy.</P>
              <P>(C) Site-specific data needs, the evaluation of alternatives, and the documentation of the selected remedy should reflect the scope and complexity of the site problems being addressed.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Expectations.</E> EPA generally shall consider the following expectations in developing appropriate remedial alternatives:</P>

              <P>(A) EPA expects to use treatment to address the principal threats posed by a site, wherever practicable. Principal <PRTPAGE P="70"/>threats for which treatment is most likely to be appropriate include liquids, areas contaminated with high concentrations of toxic compounds, and highly mobile materials.</P>
              <P>(B) EPA expects to use engineering controls, such as containment, for waste that poses a relatively low long-term threat or where treatment is impracticable.</P>
              <P>(C) EPA expects to use a combination of methods, as appropriate, to achieve protection of human health and the environment. In appropriate site situations, treatment of the principal threats posed by a site, with priority placed on treating waste that is liquid, highly toxic or highly mobile, will be combined with engineering controls (such as containment) and institutional controls, as appropriate, for treatment residuals and untreated waste.</P>
              <P>(D) EPA expects to use institutional controls such as water use and deed restrictions to supplement engineering controls as appropriate for short- and long-term management to prevent or limit exposure to hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. Institutional controls may be used during the conduct of the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) and implementation of the remedial action and, where necessary, as a component of the completed remedy. The use of institutional controls shall not substitute for active response measures (e.g., treatment and/or containment of source material, restoration of ground waters to their beneficial uses) as the sole remedy unless such active measures are determined not to be practicable, based on the balancing of trade-offs among alternatives that is conducted during the selection of remedy.</P>
              <P>(E) EPA expects to consider using innovative technology when such technology offers the potential for comparable or superior treatment performance or implementability, fewer or lesser adverse impacts than other available approaches, or lower costs for similar levels of performance than demonstrated technologies.</P>
              <P>(F) EPA expects to return usable ground waters to their beneficial uses wherever practicable, within a timeframe that is reasonable given the particular circumstances of the site. When restoration of ground water to beneficial uses is not practicable, EPA expects to prevent further migration of the plume, prevent exposure to the contaminated ground water, and evaluate further risk reduction.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Remedial investigation/feasibility study.</E> The purpose of the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) is to assess site conditions and evaluate alternatives to the extent necessary to select a remedy. Developing and conducting an RI/FS generally includes the following activities: project scoping, data collection, risk assessment, treatability studies, and analysis of alternatives. The scope and timing of these activities should be tailored to the nature and complexity of the problem and the response alternatives being considered.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scoping.</E> In implementing this section, the lead agency should consider the program goal, program management principles, and expectations contained in this rule. The investigative and analytical studies should be tailored to site circumstances so that the scope and detail of the analysis is appropriate to the complexity of site problems being addressed. During scoping, the lead and support agencies shall confer to identify the optimal set and sequence of actions necessary to address site problems. Specifically, the lead agency shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Assemble and evaluate existing data on the site, including the results of any removal actions, remedial preliminary assessment and site inspections, and the NPL listing process.</P>
              <P>(2) Develop a conceptual understanding of the site based on the evaluation of existing data described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Identify likely response scenarios and potentially applicable technologies and operable units that may address site problems.</P>

              <P>(4) Undertake limited data collection efforts or studies where this information will assist in scoping the RI/FS or accelerate response actions, and begin to identify the need for treatability studies, as appropriate.<PRTPAGE P="71"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Identify the type, quality, and quantity of the data that will be collected during the RI/FS to support decisions regarding remedial response activities.</P>
              <P>(6) Prepare site-specific health and safety plans that shall specify, at a minimum, employee training and protective equipment, medical surveillance requirements, standard operating procedures, and a contingency plan that conforms with 29 CFR 1910.120 (l)(1) and (l)(2).</P>
              <P>(7) If natural resources are or may be injured by the release, ensure that state and federal trustees of the affected natural resources have been notified in order that the trustees may initiate appropriate actions, including those identified in subpart G of this part. The lead agency shall seek to coordinate necessary assessments, evaluations, investigations, and planning with such state and federal trustees.</P>
              <P>(8) Develop sampling and analysis plans that shall provide a process for obtaining data of sufficient quality and quantity to satisfy data needs. Sampling and analysis plans shall be reviewed and approved by EPA. The sampling and analysis plans shall consist of two parts:</P>
              <P>(i) The field sampling plan, which describes the number, type, and location of samples and the type of analyses; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The quality assurance project plan, which describes policy, organization, and functional activities and the data quality objectives and measures necessary to achieve adequate data for use in selecting the appropriate remedy.</P>
              <P>(9) Initiate the identification of potential federal and state ARARs and, as appropriate, other criteria, advisories, or guidance to be considered.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Community relations.</E> (1) The community relations requirements described in this section apply to all remedial activities undertaken pursuant to CERCLA section 104 and to section 106 or section 122 consent orders or decrees, or section 106 administrative orders.</P>
              <P>(2) The lead agency shall provide for the conduct of the following community relations activities, to the extent practicable, prior to commencing field work for the remedial investigation:</P>
              <P>(i) Conducting interviews with local officials, community residents, public interest groups, or other interested or affected parties, as appropriate, to solicit their concerns and information needs, and to learn how and when citizens would like to be involved in the Superfund process.</P>
              <P>(ii) Preparing a formal community relations plan (CRP), based on the community interviews and other relevant information, specifying the community relations activities that the lead agency expects to undertake during the remedial response. The purpose of the CRP is to:</P>
              <P>(A) Ensure the public appropriate opportunities for involvement in a wide variety of site-related decisions, including site analysis and characterization, alternatives analysis, and selection of remedy;</P>
              <P>(B) Determine, based on community interviews, appropriate activities to ensure such public involvement, and</P>
              <P>(C) Provide appropriate opportunities for the community to learn about the site.</P>
              <P>(iii) Establishing at least one local information repository at or near the location of the response action. Each information repository should contain a copy of items made available to the public, including information that describes the technical assistance grants application process. The lead agency shall inform interested parties of the establishment of the information repository.</P>
              <P>(iv) Informing the community of the availability of technical assistance grants.</P>
              <P>(3) For PRP actions, the lead agency shall plan and implement the community relations program at a site. PRPs may participate in aspects of the community relations program at the discretion of and with oversight by the lead agency.</P>

              <P>(4) The lead agency may conduct technical discussions involving PRPs and the public. These technical discussions may be held separately from, but contemporaneously with, the negotiations/settlement discussions.<PRTPAGE P="72"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) In addition, the following provisions specifically apply to enforcement actions:</P>

              <P>(i) Lead agencies entering into an enforcement agreement with de minimis parties under CERCLA section 122(g) or cost recovery settlements under section 122(h) shall publish a notice of the proposed agreement in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> at least 30 days before the agreement becomes final, as required by section 122(i). The notice must identify the name of the facility and the parties to the proposed agreement and must allow an opportunity for comment and consideration of comments; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the enforcement agreement is embodied in a consent decree, public notice and opportunity for public comment shall be provided in accordance with 28 CFR 50.7.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Remedial investigation.</E> (1) The purpose of the remedial investigation (RI) is to collect data necessary to adequately characterize the site for the purpose of developing and evaluating effective remedial alternatives. To characterize the site, the lead agency shall, as appropriate, conduct field investigations, including treatability studies, and conduct a baseline risk assessment. The RI provides information to assess the risks to human health and the environment and to support the development, evaluation, and selection of appropriate response alternatives. Site characterization may be conducted in one or more phases to focus sampling efforts and increase the efficiency of the investigation. Because estimates of actual or potential exposures and associated impacts on human and environmental receptors may be refined throughout the phases of the RI as new information is obtained, site characterization activities should be fully integrated with the development and evaluation of alternatives in the feasibility study. Bench- or pilot-scale treatability studies shall be conducted, when appropriate and practicable, to provide additional data for the detailed analysis and to support engineering design of remedial alternatives.</P>
              <P>(2) The lead agency shall characterize the nature of and threat posed by the hazardous substances and hazardous materials and gather data necessary to assess the extent to which the release poses a threat to human health or the environment or to support the analysis and design of potential response actions by conducting, as appropriate, field investigations to assess the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Physical characteristics of the site, including important surface features, soils, geology, hydrogeology, meteorology, and ecology;</P>
              <P>(ii) Characteristics or classifications of air, surface water, and ground water;</P>
              <P>(iii) The general characteristics of the waste, including quantities, state, concentration, toxicity, propensity to bioaccumulate, persistence, and mobility;</P>
              <P>(iv) The extent to which the source can be adequately identified and characterized;</P>
              <P>(v) Actual and potential exposure pathways through environmental media;</P>
              <P>(vi) Actual and potential exposure routes, for example, inhalation and ingestion; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Other factors, such as sensitive populations, that pertain to the characterization of the site or support the analysis of potential remedial action alternatives.</P>
              <P>(3) The lead and support agency shall identify their respective potential ARARs related to the location of and contaminants at the site in a timely manner. The lead and support agencies may also, as appropriate, identify other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance in a timely manner (see § 300.400(g)(3)).</P>

              <P>(4) Using the data developed under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the lead agency shall conduct a site-specific baseline risk assessment to characterize the current and potential threats to human health and the environment that may be posed by contaminants migrating to ground water or surface water, releasing to air, leaching through soil, remaining in the soil, and bioaccumulating in the food chain. The results of the baseline risk assessment will help establish acceptable exposure levels for use in developing remedial alternatives in the FS, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Feasibility study.</E> (1) The primary objective of the feasibility study (FS) is to ensure that appropriate remedial alternatives are developed and evaluated such that relevant information concerning the remedial action options can be presented to a decision-maker and an appropriate remedy selected. The lead agency may develop a feasibility study to address a specific site problem or the entire site. The development and evaluation of alternatives shall reflect the scope and complexity of the remedial action under consideration and the site problems being addressed. Development of alternatives shall be fully integrated with the site characterization activities of the remedial investigation described in paragraph (d) of this section. The lead agency shall include an alternatives screening step, when needed, to select a reasonable number of alternatives for detailed analysis.</P>
              <P>(2) Alternatives shall be developed that protect human health and the environment by recycling waste or by eliminating, reducing, and/or controlling risks posed through each pathway by a site. The number and type of alternatives to be analyzed shall be determined at each site, taking into account the scope, characteristics, and complexity of the site problem that is being addressed. In developing and, as appropriate, screening the alternatives, the lead agency shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Establish remedial action objectives specifying contaminants and media of concern, potential exposure pathways, and remediation goals. Initially, preliminary remediation goals are developed based on readily available information, such as chemical-specific ARARs or other reliable information. Preliminary remediation goals should be modified, as necessary, as more information becomes available during the RI/FS. Final remediation goals will be determined when the remedy is selected. Remediation goals shall establish acceptable exposure levels that are protective of human health and the environment and shall be developed by considering the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements under federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws, if available, and the following factors:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For systemic toxicants, acceptable exposure levels shall represent concentration levels to which the human population, including sensitive subgroups, may be exposed without adverse effect during a lifetime or part of a lifetime, incorporating an adequate margin of safety;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For known or suspected carcinogens, acceptable exposure levels are generally concentration levels that represent an excess upper bound lifetime cancer risk to an individual of between 10<E T="51">−4</E> and 10<E T="51">−6</E> using information on the relationship between dose and response. The 10<E T="51">−6</E> risk level shall be used as the point of departure for determining remediation goals for alternatives when ARARs are not available or are not sufficiently protective because of the presence of multiple contaminants at a site or multiple pathways of exposure;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Factors related to technical limitations such as detection/quantification limits for contaminants;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Factors related to uncertainty; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Other pertinent information.</P>
              <P>(B) Maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs), established under the Safe Drinking Water Act, that are set at levels above zero, shall be attained by remedial actions for ground or surface waters that are current or potential sources of drinking water, where the MCLGs are relevant and appropriate under the circumstances of the release based on the factors in § 300.400(g)(2). If an MCLG is determined not to be relevant and appropriate, the corresponding maximum contaminant level (MCL) shall be attained where relevant and appropriate to the circumstances of the release.</P>

              <P>(C) Where the MCLG for a contaminant has been set at a level of zero, the MCL promulgated for that contaminant under the Safe Drinking Water Act shall be attained by remedial actions for ground or surface waters that are current or potential sources of drinking water, where the MCL is relevant and appropriate under the circumstances of the release based on the factors in § 300.400(g)(2).<PRTPAGE P="74"/>
              </P>

              <P>(D) In cases involving multiple contaminants or pathways where attainment of chemical-specific ARARs will result in cumulative risk in excess of 10<E T="51">−4</E>, criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section may also be considered when determining the cleanup level to be attained.</P>
              <P>(E) Water quality criteria established under sections 303 or 304 of the Clean Water Act shall be attained where relevant and appropriate under the circumstances of the release.</P>
              <P>(F) An alternate concentration limit (ACL) may be established in accordance with CERCLA section 121(d)(2)(B)(ii).</P>
              <P>(G) Environmental evaluations shall be performed to assess threats to the environment, especially sensitive habitats and critical habitats of species protected under the Endangered Species Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify and evaluate potentially suitable technologies, including innovative technologies;</P>
              <P>(iii) Assemble suitable technologies into alternative remedial actions.</P>
              <P>(3) For source control actions, the lead agency shall develop, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) A range of alternatives in which treatment that reduces the toxicity, mobility, or volume of the hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants is a principal element. As appropriate, this range shall include an alternative that removes or destroys hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants to the maximum extent feasible, eliminating or minimizing, to the degree possible, the need for long-term management. The lead agency also shall develop, as appropriate, other alternatives which, at a minimum, treat the principal threats posed by the site but vary in the degree of treatment employed and the quantities and characteristics of the treatment residuals and untreated waste that must be managed; and</P>
              <P>(ii) One or more alternatives that involve little or no treatment, but provide protection of human health and the environment primarily by preventing or controlling exposure to hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, through engineering controls, for example, containment, and, as necessary, institutional controls to protect human health and the environment and to assure continued effectiveness of the response action.</P>
              <P>(4) For ground-water response actions, the lead agency shall develop a limited number of remedial alternatives that attain site-specific remediation levels within different restoration time periods utilizing one or more different technologies.</P>
              <P>(5) The lead agency shall develop one or more innovative treatment technologies for further consideration if those technologies offer the potential for comparable or superior performance or implementability; fewer or lesser adverse impacts than other available approaches; or lower costs for similar levels of performance than demonstrated treatment technologies.</P>
              <P>(6) The no-action alternative, which may be no further action if some removal or remedial action has already occurred at the site, shall be developed.</P>
              <P>(7) As appropriate, and to the extent sufficient information is available, the short- and long-term aspects of the following three criteria shall be used to guide the development and screening of remedial alternatives:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Effectiveness.</E> This criterion focuses on the degree to which an alternative reduces toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment, minimizes residual risks and affords long-term protection, complies with ARARs, minimizes short-term impacts, and how quickly it achieves protection. Alternatives providing significantly less effectiveness than other, more promising alternatives may be eliminated. Alternatives that do not provide adequate protection of human health and the environment shall be eliminated from further consideration.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Implementability.</E> This criterion focuses on the technical feasibility and availability of the technologies each alternative would employ and the administrative feasibility of implementing the alternative. Alternatives that are technically or administratively infeasible or that would require equipment, specialists, or facilities that are not available within a reasonable period of time may be eliminated from further consideration.<PRTPAGE P="75"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Cost.</E> The costs of construction and any long-term costs to operate and maintain the alternatives shall be considered. Costs that are grossly excessive compared to the overall effectiveness of alternatives may be considered as one of several factors used to eliminate alternatives. Alternatives providing effectiveness and implementability similar to that of another alternative by employing a similar method of treatment or engineering control, but at greater cost, may be eliminated.</P>
              <P>(8) The lead agency shall notify the support agency of the alternatives that will be evaluated in detail to facilitate the identification of ARARs and, as appropriate, pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Detailed analysis of alternatives.</E> (i) A detailed analysis shall be conducted on the limited number of alternatives that represent viable approaches to remedial action after evaluation in the screening stage. The lead and support agencies must identify their ARARs related to specific actions in a timely manner and no later than the early stages of the comparative analysis. The lead and support agencies may also, as appropriate, identify other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance in a timely manner.</P>
              <P>(ii) The detailed analysis consists of an assessment of individual alternatives against each of nine evaluation criteria and a comparative analysis that focuses upon the relative performance of each alternative against those criteria.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Nine criteria for evaluation.</E> The analysis of alternatives under review shall reflect the scope and complexity of site problems and alternatives being evaluated and consider the relative significance of the factors within each criteria. The nine evaluation criteria are as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Overall protection of human health and the environment.</E> Alternatives shall be assessed to determine whether they can adequately protect human health and the environment, in both the short- and long-term, from unacceptable risks posed by hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants present at the site by eliminating, reducing, or controlling exposures to levels established during development of remediation goals consistent with § 300.430(e)(2)(i). Overall protection of human health and the environment draws on the assessments of other evaluation criteria, especially long-term effectiveness and permanence, short-term effectiveness, and compliance with ARARs.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Compliance with ARARs.</E> The alternatives shall be assessed to determine whether they attain applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements under federal environmental laws and state environmental or facility siting laws or provide grounds for invoking one of the waivers under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Long-term effectiveness and permanence.</E> Alternatives shall be assessed for the long-term effectiveness and permanence they afford, along with the degree of certainty that the alternative will prove successful. Factors that shall be considered, as appropriate, include the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Magnitude of residual risk remaining from untreated waste or treatment residuals remaining at the conclusion of the remedial activities. The characteristics of the residuals should be considered to the degree that they remain hazardous, taking into account their volume, toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Adequacy and reliability of controls such as containment systems and institutional controls that are necessary to manage treatment residuals and untreated waste. This factor addresses in particular the uncertainties associated with land disposal for providing long-term protection from residuals; the assessment of the potential need to replace technical components of the alternative, such as a cap, a slurry wall, or a treatment system; and the potential exposure pathways and risks posed should the remedial action need replacement.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment.</E> The degree to which alternatives employ recycling or treatment that reduces toxicity, mobility, or volume shall be assessed, including how treatment is used to address the principal threats posed by the site. Factors that shall be considered, as appropriate, include the following:<PRTPAGE P="76"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The treatment or recycling processes the alternatives employ and materials they will treat;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The amount of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants that will be destroyed, treated, or recycled;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The degree of expected reduction in toxicity, mobility, or volume of the waste due to treatment or recycling and the specification of which reduction(s) are occurring;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The degree to which the treatment is irreversible;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The type and quantity of residuals that will remain following treatment, considering the persistence, toxicity, mobility, and propensity to bioaccumulate of such hazardous substances and their constituents; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The degree to which treatment reduces the inherent hazards posed by principal threats at the site.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Short-term effectiveness.</E> The short-term impacts of alternatives shall be assessed considering the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Short-term risks that might be posed to the community during implementation of an alternative;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Potential impacts on workers during remedial action and the effectiveness and reliability of protective measures;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Potential environmental impacts of the remedial action and the effectiveness and reliability of mitigative measures during implementation; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Time until protection is achieved.</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Implementability.</E> The ease or difficulty of implementing the alternatives shall be assessed by considering the following types of factors as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Technical feasibility, including technical difficulties and unknowns associated with the construction and operation of a technology, the reliability of the technology, ease of undertaking additional remedial actions, and the ability to monitor the effectiveness of the remedy.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Administrative feasibility, including activities needed to coordinate with other offices and agencies and the ability and time required to obtain any necessary approvals and permits from other agencies (for off-site actions);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Availability of services and materials, including the availability of adequate off-site treatment, storage capacity, and disposal capacity and services; the availability of necessary equipment and specialists, and provisions to ensure any necessary additional resources; the availability of services and materials; and availability of prospective technologies.</P>
              <P>(G) <E T="03">Cost.</E> The types of costs that shall be assessed include the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Capital costs, including both direct and indirect costs;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Annual operation and maintenance costs; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Net present value of capital and O&amp;M costs.</P>
              <P>(H) <E T="03">State acceptance.</E> Assessment of state concerns may not be completed until comments on the RI/FS are received but may be discussed, to the extent possible, in the proposed plan issued for public comment. The state concerns that shall be assessed include the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The state's position and key concerns related to the preferred alternative and other alternatives; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) State comments on ARARs or the proposed use of waivers.</P>
              <P>(I) <E T="03">Community acceptance.</E> This assessment includes determining which components of the alternatives interested persons in the community support, have reservations about, or oppose. This assessment may not be completed until comments on the proposed plan are received.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Selection of remedy</E>—(1) Remedies selected shall reflect the scope and purpose of the actions being undertaken and how the action relates to long-term, comprehensive response at the site.</P>
              <P>(i) The criteria noted in paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section are used to select a remedy. These criteria are categorized into three groups.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Threshold criteria.</E> Overall protection of human health and the environment and compliance with ARARs (unless a specific ARAR is waived) are threshold requirements that each alternative must meet in order to be eligible for selection.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Primary balancing criteria.</E> The five primary balancing criteria are long-<PRTPAGE P="77"/>term effectiveness and permanence; reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment; short-term effectiveness; implementability; and cost.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Modifying criteria.</E> State and community acceptance are modifying criteria that shall be considered in remedy selection.</P>
              <P>(ii) The selection of a remedial action is a two-step process and shall proceed in accordance with § 300.515(e). First, the lead agency, in conjunction with the support agency, identifies a preferred alternative and presents it to the public in a proposed plan, for review and comment. Second, the lead agency shall review the public comments and consult with the state (or support agency) in order to determine if the alternative remains the most appropriate remedial action for the site or site problem. The lead agency, as specified in § 300.515(e), makes the final remedy selection decision, which shall be documented in the ROD. Each remedial alternative selected as a Superfund remedy will employ the criteria as indicated in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section to make the following determination:</P>
              <P>(A) Each remedial action selected shall be protective of human health and the environment.</P>
              <P>(B) On-site remedial actions selected in a ROD must attain those ARARs that are identified at the time of ROD signature or provide grounds for invoking a waiver under § 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Requirements that are promulgated or modified after ROD signature must be attained (or waived) only when determined to be applicable or relevant and appropriate and necessary to ensure that the remedy is protective of human health and the environment.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Components of the remedy not described in the ROD must attain (or waive) requirements that are identified as applicable or relevant and appropriate at the time the amendment to the ROD or the explanation of significant difference describing the component is signed.</P>
              <P>(C) An alternative that does not meet an ARAR under federal environmental or state environmental or facility siting laws may be selected under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The alternative is an interim measure and will become part of a total remedial action that will attain the applicable or relevant and appropriate federal or state requirement;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Compliance with the requirement will result in greater risk to human health and the environment than other alternatives;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Compliance with the requirement is technically impracticable from an engineering perspective;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The alternative will attain a standard of performance that is equivalent to that required under the otherwise applicable standard, requirement, or limitation through use of another method or approach;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) With respect to a state requirement, the state has not consistently applied, or demonstrated the intention to consistently apply, the promulgated requirement in similar circumstances at other remedial actions within the state; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) For Fund-financed response actions only, an alternative that attains the ARAR will not provide a balance between the need for protection of human health and the environment at the site and the availability of Fund monies to respond to other sites that may present a threat to human health and the environment.</P>
              <P>(D) Each remedial action selected shall be cost-effective, provided that it first satisfies the threshold criteria set forth in § 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(A) and (B). Cost-effectiveness is determined by evaluating the following three of the five balancing criteria noted in § 300.430(f)(1)(i)(B) to determine overall effectiveness: long-term effectiveness and permanence, reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment, and short-term effectiveness. Overall effectiveness is then compared to cost to ensure that the remedy is cost-effective. A remedy shall be cost-effective if its costs are proportional to its overall effectiveness.</P>

              <P>(E) Each remedial action shall utilize permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable. This requirement shall be fulfilled by selecting the alternative that satisfies paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section and <PRTPAGE P="78"/>provides the best balance of trade-offs among alternatives in terms of the five primary balancing criteria noted in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section. The balancing shall emphasize long-term effectiveness and reduction of toxicity, mobility, or volume through treatment. The balancing shall also consider the preference for treatment as a principal element and the bias against off-site land disposal of untreated waste. In making the determination under this paragraph, the modifying criteria of state acceptance and community acceptance described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section shall also be considered.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">The proposed plan.</E> In the first step in the remedy selection process, the lead agency shall identify the alternative that best meets the requirements in § 300.430(f)(1), above, and shall present that alternative to the public in a proposed plan. The lead agency, in conjunction with the support agency and consistent with § 300.515(e), shall prepare a proposed plan that briefly describes the remedial alternatives analyzed by the lead agency, proposes a preferred remedial action alternative, and summarizes the information relied upon to select the preferred alternative. The selection of remedy process for an operable unit may be initiated at any time during the remedial action process. The purpose of the proposed plan is to supplement the RI/FS and provide the public with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the preferred alternative for remedial action, as well as alternative plans under consideration, and to participate in the selection of remedial action at a site. At a minimum, the proposed plan shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Provide a brief summary description of the remedial alternatives evaluated in the detailed analysis established under paragraph (e)(9) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify and provide a discussion of the rationale that supports the preferred alternative;</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide a summary of any formal comments received from the support agency; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Provide a summary explanation of any proposed waiver identified under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C) of this section from an ARAR.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Community relations to support the selection of remedy.</E> (i) The lead agency, after preparation of the proposed plan and review by the support agency, shall conduct the following activities:</P>
              <P>(A) Publish a notice of availability and brief analysis of the proposed plan in a major local newspaper of general circulation;</P>
              <P>(B) Make the proposed plan and supporting analysis and information available in the administrative record required under subpart I of this part;</P>
              <P>(C) Provide a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 calendar days, for submission of written and oral comments on the proposed plan and the supporting analysis and information located in the information repository, including the RI/FS. Upon timely request, the lead agency will extend the public comment period by a minimum of 30 additional days;</P>
              <P>(D) Provide the opportunity for a public meeting to be held during the public comment period at or near the site at issue regarding the proposed plan and the supporting analysis and information;</P>
              <P>(E) Keep a transcript of the public meeting held during the public comment period pursuant to CERCLA section 117(a) and make such transcript available to the public; and</P>
              <P>(F) Prepare a written summary of significant comments, criticisms, and new relevant information submitted during the public comment period and the lead agency response to each issue. This responsiveness summary shall be made available with the record of decision.</P>
              <P>(ii) After publication of the proposed plan and prior to adoption of the selected remedy in the record of decision, if new information is made available that significantly changes the basic features of the remedy with respect to scope, performance, or cost, such that the remedy significantly differs from the original proposal in the proposed plan and the supporting analysis and information, the lead agency shall:</P>

              <P>(A) Include a discussion in the record of decision of the significant changes and reasons for such changes, if the lead agency determines such changes could be reasonably anticipated by the public based on the alternatives and <PRTPAGE P="79"/>other information available in the proposed plan or the supporting analysis and information in the administrative record; or</P>
              <P>(B) Seek additional public comment on a revised proposed plan, when the lead agency determines the change could not have been reasonably anticipated by the public based on the information available in the proposed plan or the supporting analysis and information in the administrative record. The lead agency shall, prior to adoption of the selected remedy in the ROD, issue a revised proposed plan, which shall include a discussion of the significant changes and the reasons for such changes, in accordance with the public participation requirements described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Final remedy selection.</E> (i) In the second and final step in the remedy selection process, the lead agency shall reassess its initial determination that the preferred alternative provides the best balance of trade-offs, now factoring in any new information or points of view expressed by the state (or support agency) and community during the public comment period. The lead agency shall consider state (or support agency) and community comments regarding the lead agency's evaluation of alternatives with respect to the other criteria. These comments may prompt the lead agency to modify aspects of the preferred alternative or decide that another alternative provides a more appropriate balance. The lead agency, as specified in § 300.515(e), shall make the final remedy selection decision and document that decision in the ROD.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a remedial action is selected that results in hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants remaining at the site above levels that allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, the lead agency shall review such action no less often than every five years after initiation of the selected remedial action.</P>
              <P>(iii) The process for selection of a remedial action at a federal facility on the NPL, pursuant to CERCLA section 120, shall entail:</P>
              <P>(A) Joint selection of remedial action by the head of the relevant department, agency, or instrumentality and EPA; or</P>
              <P>(B) If mutual agreement on the remedy is not reached, selection of the remedy is made by EPA.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Documenting the decision.</E> (i) To support the selection of a remedial action, all facts, analyses of facts, and site-specific policy determinations considered in the course of carrying out activities in this section shall be documented, as appropriate, in a record of decision, in a level of detail appropriate to the site situation, for inclusion in the administrative record required under subpart I of this part. Documentation shall explain how the evaluation criteria in paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section were used to select the remedy.</P>
              <P>(ii) The ROD shall describe the following statutory requirements as they relate to the scope and objectives of the action:</P>
              <P>(A) How the selected remedy is protective of human health and the environment, explaining how the remedy eliminates, reduces, or controls exposures to human and environmental receptors;</P>
              <P>(B) The federal and state requirements that are applicable or relevant and appropriate to the site that the remedy will attain;</P>
              <P>(C) The applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements of other federal and state laws that the remedy will not meet, the waiver invoked, and the justification for invoking the waiver;</P>
              <P>(D) How the remedy is cost-effective, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, explaining how the remedy provides overall effectiveness proportional to its costs;</P>
              <P>(E) How the remedy utilizes permanent solutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologies to the maximum extent practicable; and</P>

              <P>(F) Whether the preference for remedies employing treatment which permanently and significantly reduces the toxicity, mobility, or volume of the hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants as a principal element is or is not satisfied by the selected remedy. If this preference is not satisfied, the record of decision must explain why a remedial action involving such <PRTPAGE P="80"/>reductions in toxicity, mobility, or volume was not selected.</P>
              <P>(iii) The ROD also shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Indicate, as appropriate, the remediation goals, discussed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, that the remedy is expected to achieve. Performance shall be measured at appropriate locations in the ground water, surface water, soils, air, and other affected environmental media. Measurement relating to the performance of the treatment processes and the engineering controls may also be identified, as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(B) Discuss significant changes and the response to comments described in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(F) of this section;</P>
              <P>(C) Describe whether hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants will remain at the site such that a review of the remedial action under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section no less often than every five years shall be required; and</P>
              <P>(D) When appropriate, provide a commitment for further analysis and selection of long-term response measures within an appropriate time-frame.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Community relations when the record of decision is signed.</E> After the ROD is signed, the lead agency shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Publish a notice of the availability of the ROD in a major local newspaper of general circulation; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Make the record of decision available for public inspection and copying at or near the facility at issue prior to the commencement of any remedial action.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Remedial design/remedial action, operation and maintenance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The remedial design/remedial action (RD/RA) stage includes the development of the actual design of the selected remedy and implementation of the remedy through construction. A period of operation and maintenance may follow the RA activities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">RD/RA activities.</E> (1) All RD/RA activities shall be in conformance with the remedy selected and set forth in the ROD or other decision document for that site. Those portions of RD/RA sampling and analysis plans describing the QA/QC requirements for chemical and analytical testing and sampling procedures of samples taken for the purpose of determining whether cleanup action levels specified in the ROD are achieved, generally will be consistent with the requirements of § 300.430(b)(8).</P>
              <P>(2) During the course of the RD/RA, the lead agency shall be responsible for ensuring that all federal and state requirements that are identified in the ROD as applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements for the action are met. If waivers from any ARARs are involved, the lead agency shall be responsible for ensuring that the conditions of the waivers are met.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Community relations.</E> (1) Prior to the initiation of RD, the lead agency shall review the CRP to determine whether it should be revised to describe further public involvement activities during RD/RA that are not already addressed or provided for in the CRP.</P>
              <P>(2) After the adoption of the ROD, if the remedial action or enforcement action taken, or the settlement or consent decree entered into, differs significantly from the remedy selected in the ROD with respect to scope, performance, or cost, the lead agency shall consult with the support agency, as appropriate, and shall either:</P>
              <P>(i) Publish an explanation of significant differences when the differences in the remedial or enforcement action, settlement, or consent decree significantly change but do not fundamentally alter the remedy selected in the ROD with respect to scope, performance, or cost. To issue an explanation of significant differences, the lead agency shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Make the explanation of significant differences and supporting information available to the public in the administrative record established under § 300.815 and the information repository; and</P>
              <P>(B) Publish a notice that briefly summarizes the explanation of significant differences, including the reasons for such differences, in a major local newspaper of general circulation; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Propose an amendment to the ROD if the differences in the remedial or enforcement action, settlement, or consent decree fundamentally alter the basic features of the selected remedy with respect to scope, performance, or <PRTPAGE P="81"/>cost. To amend the ROD, the lead agency, in conjunction with the support agency, as provided in § 300.515(e), shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Issue a notice of availability and brief description of the proposed amendment to the ROD in a major local newspaper of general circulation;</P>
              <P>(B) Make the proposed amendment to the ROD and information supporting the decision available for public comment;</P>
              <P>(C) Provide a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 calendar days, for submission of written or oral comments on the amendment to the ROD. Upon timely request, the lead agency will extend the public comment period by a minimum of 30 additional days;</P>
              <P>(D) Provide the opportunity for a public meeting to be held during the public comment period at or near the facility at issue;</P>
              <P>(E) Keep a transcript of comments received at the public meeting held during the public comment period;</P>
              <P>(F) Include in the amended ROD a brief explanation of the amendment and the response to each of the significant comments, criticisms, and new relevant information submitted during the public comment period;</P>
              <P>(G) Publish a notice of the availability of the amended ROD in a major local newspaper of general circulation; and</P>
              <P>(H) Make the amended ROD and supporting information available to the public in the administrative record and information repository prior to the commencement of the remedial action affected by the amendment.</P>
              <P>(3) After the completion of the final engineering design, the lead agency shall issue a fact sheet and provide, as appropriate, a public briefing prior to the initiation of the remedial action.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Contractor conflict of interest.</E> (1) For Fund-financed RD/RA and O&amp;M activities, the lead agency shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Include appropriate language in the solicitation requiring potential prime contractors to submit information on their status, as well as the status of their subcontractors, parent companies, and affiliates, as potentially responsible parties at the site.</P>
              <P>(ii) Require potential prime contractors to certify that, to the best of their knowledge, they and their potential subcontractors, parent companies, and affiliates have disclosed all information described in § 300.435(d)(1)(i) or that no such information exists, and that any such information discovered after submission of their bid or proposal or contract award will be disclosed immediately.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to contract award, the lead agency shall evaluate the information provided by the potential prime contractors and:</P>
              <P>(i) Determine whether they have conflicts of interest that could significantly impact the performance of the contract or the liability of potential prime contractors or subcontractors.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a potential prime contractor or subcontractor has a conflict of interest that cannot be avoided or otherwise resolved, and using that potential prime contractor or subcontractor to conduct RD/RA or O&amp;M work under a Fund-financed action would not be in the best interests of the state or federal government, an offeror or bidder contemplating use of that prime contractor or subcontractor may be declared nonresponsible or ineligible for award in accordance with appropriate acquisition regulations, and the contract may be awarded to the next eligible offeror or bidder.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Recontracting.</E> (1) If a Fund-financed contract must be terminated because additional work outside the scope of the contract is needed, EPA is authorized to take appropriate steps to continue interim RAs as necessary to reduce risks to public health and the environment. Appropriate steps may include extending an existing contract for a federal-lead RA or amending a cooperative agreement for a state-lead RA. Until the lead agency can reopen the bidding process and recontract to complete the RA, EPA may take such appropriate steps as described above to cover interim work to reduce such risks, where:</P>
              <P>(i) Additional work is found to be needed as a result of such unforeseen situations as newly discovered sources, types, or quantities of hazardous substances at a facility; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Performance of the complete RA requires the lead agency to rebid the contract because the existing contract <PRTPAGE P="82"/>does not encompass this newly discovered work.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of such interim actions shall not exceed $2 million.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Operation and maintenance.</E> (1) Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) measures are initiated after the remedy has achieved the remedial action objectives and remediation goals in the ROD, and is determined to be operational and functional, except for ground- or surface-water restoration actions covered under § 300.435(f)(4). A state must provide its assurance to assume responsibility for O&amp;M, including, where appropriate, requirements for maintaining institutional controls, under § 300.510(c).</P>
              <P>(2) A remedy becomes “operational and functional” either one year after construction is complete, or when the remedy is determined concurrently by EPA and the state to be functioning properly and is performing as designed, whichever is earlier. EPA may grant extensions to the one-year period, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) For Fund-financed remedial actions involving treatment or other measures to restore ground- or surface-water quality to a level that assures protection of human health and the environment, the operation of such treatment or other measures for a period of up to 10 years after the remedy becomes operational and functional will be considered part of the remedial action. Activities required to maintain the effectiveness of such treatment or measures following the 10-year period, or after remedial action is complete, whichever is earlier, shall be considered O&amp;M. For the purposes of federal funding provided under CERCLA section 104(c)(6), a restoration activity will be considered administratively “complete” when:</P>
              <P>(i) Measures restore ground- or surface-water quality to a level that assures protection of human health and the environment;</P>
              <P>(ii) Measures restore ground or surface water to such a point that reductions in contaminant concentrations are no longer significant; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Ten years have elapsed, whichever is earliest.</P>
              <P>(4) The following shall not be deemed to constitute treatment or other measures to restore contaminated ground or surface water under § 300.435(f)(3):</P>
              <P>(i) Source control maintenance measures; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Ground- or surface-water measures initiated for the primary purpose of providing a drinking-water supply, not for the purpose of restoring ground water.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 300.440</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for planning and implementing off-site response actions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This section applies to any remedial or removal action involving the off-site transfer of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant as defined under CERCLA sections 101 (14) and (33) (“CERCLA waste”) that is conducted by EPA, States, private parties, or other Federal agencies, that is Fund-financed and/or is taken pursuant to any CERCLA authority, including cleanups at Federal facilities under section 120 of CERCLA, and cleanups under section 311 of the Clean Water Act (except for cleanup of petroleum exempt under CERCLA). Applicability extends to those actions taken jointly under CERCLA and another authority.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases of emergency removal actions under CERCLA, emergency actions taken during remedial actions, or response actions under section 311 of the Clean Water Act where the release poses an immediate and significant threat to human health and the environment, the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) may determine that it is necessary to transfer CERCLA waste off-site without following the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) This section applies to CERCLA wastes from cleanup actions based on CERCLA decision documents signed or consent decrees lodged after October 17, 1986 (“post-SARA CERCLA wastes”) as well as those based on CERCLA decision documents signed and consent decrees lodged prior to October 17, 1986 (“pre-SARA CERCLA wastes”). Pre-SARA and post-SARA CERCLA wastes are subject to the same acceptability criteria in § 300.440(b)(1) and (2).</P>

              <P>(4) EPA (usually the EPA Regional Office) will determine the acceptability under this section of any facility selected for the treatment, storage, or <PRTPAGE P="83"/>disposal of CERCLA waste. EPA will determine if there are relevant releases or relevant violations at a facility prior to the facility's initial receipt of CERCLA waste. A facility which has previously been evaluated and found acceptable under this rule (or the preceding policy) is acceptable until the EPA Regional Office notifies the facility otherwise pursuant to § 300.440(d).</P>
              <P>(5) Off-site transfers of those laboratory samples and treatability study CERCLA wastes from CERCLA sites set out in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section, are not subject to the requirements of this section. However, those CERCLA wastes may not be transferred back to the CERCLA site unless the Remedial Project Manager or OSC assures the proper management of the CERCLA waste samples or residues and gives permission to the laboratory or treatment facility for the samples and/or residues to be returned to the site.</P>
              <P>(i) Samples of CERCLA wastes sent to a laboratory for characterization;</P>
              <P>(ii) RCRA hazardous wastes that are being transferred from a CERCLA site for treatability studies and that meet the requirements for an exemption for RCRA under 40 CFR 261.4(e); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Non-RCRA wastes that are being transferred from a CERCLA site for treatability studies and that are below the quantity threshold established at 40 CFR 261.4(e)(2).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptability criteria</E>—(1) <E T="03">Facility compliance.</E> (i) A facility will be deemed in compliance for the purpose of this rule if there are no relevant violations at or affecting the unit or units receiving CERCLA waste:</P>
              <P>(A) For treatment to standards specified in 40 CFR part 268, subpart D, including any pre-treatment or storage units used prior to treatment;</P>
              <P>(B) For treatment to substantially reduce its mobility, toxicity or persistence in the absence of a defined treatment standard, including any pre-treatment or storage units used prior to treatment; or</P>
              <P>(C) For storage or ultimate disposal of CERCLA waste not treated to the previous criteria at the same facility.</P>
              <P>(ii) Relevant violations include significant deviations from regulations, compliance order provisions, or permit conditions designed to: ensure that CERCLA waste is destined for and delivered to authorized facilities; prevent releases of hazardous waste, hazardous constituents, or hazardous substances to the environment; ensure early detection of such releases; or compel corrective action for releases. Criminal violations which result in indictment are also relevant violations. In addition, violations of the following requirements may be considered relevant:</P>
              <P>(A) Applicable subsections of sections 3004 and 3005 of RCRA or, where applicable, other Federal laws (such as the Toxic Substances Control Act and subtitle D of RCRA);</P>
              <P>(B) Applicable sections of State environmental laws; and</P>
              <P>(C) In addition, land disposal units at RCRA subtitle C facilities receiving RCRA hazardous waste from response actions authorized or funded under CERCLA must be in compliance with RCRA section 3004(o) minimum technology requirements. Exceptions may be made only if the unit has been granted a waiver from these requirements under 40 CFR 264.301.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Releases.</E> (i) Release is defined in § 300.5 of this part. Releases under this section do not include:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">De minimis</E> releases;</P>
              <P>(B) Releases permitted under Federal programs or under Federal programs delegated to the States (Federally permitted releases are defined in § 300.5), except to the extent that such releases are found to pose a threat to human health and the environment; or</P>
              <P>(C) Releases to the air that do not exceed standards promulgated pursuant to RCRA section 3004(n), or absent such standards, or where such standards do not apply, releases to the air that do not present a threat to human health or the environment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Releases from units at a facility designated for off-site transfer of CERCLA waste must be addressed as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Receiving units at RCRA subtitle C facilities.</E> CERCLA wastes may be transferred to an off-site unit regulated under subtitle C of RCRA, including a facility regulated under the permit-by-rule provisions of 40 CFR 270.60 (a), (b) or (c), only if that unit is not releasing <PRTPAGE P="84"/>any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substance into the ground water, surface water, soil or air.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Other units at RCRA subtitle C land disposal facilities.</E> CERCLA wastes may not be transferred to any unit at a RCRA subtitle C land disposal facility where a non-receiving unit is releasing any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substance into the ground water, surface water, soil, or air, unless that release is controlled by an enforceable agreement for corrective action under subtitle C of RCRA or other applicable Federal or State authority. For purposes of this section, a RCRA “land disposal facility” is any RCRA facility at which a land disposal unit is located, regardless of whether a land disposal unit is the receiving unit.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Other units at RCRA subtitle C treatment, storage, and permit-by-rule facilities.</E> CERCLA wastes may not be transferred to any unit at a RCRA subtitle C treatment, storage or permit-by-rule facility, where a release of any hazardous waste, hazardous constituent, or hazardous substance from non-receiving units poses a significant threat to public health or the environment, unless that release is controlled by an enforceable agreement for corrective action under subtitle C of RCRA or other applicable Federal or State authority.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">All other facilities.</E> CERCLA wastes should not be transferred to any unit at an other-than-RCRA subtitle C facility if the EPA Regional Office has information indicating that an environmentally significant release of hazardous substances has occurred at that facility, unless the release is controlled by an enforceable agreement for corrective action under an applicable Federal or State authority.</P>
              <P>(iii) Releases are considered to be “controlled” for the purpose of this section as provided in § 300.440 (f)(3)(iv) and (f)(3)(v). A release is not considered “controlled” for the purpose of this section during the pendency of administrative or judicial challenges to corrective action requirements, unless the facility has made the requisite showing under § 300.440(e).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Basis for determining acceptability.</E> (1) If a State finds that a facility within its jurisdiction is operating in non-compliance with state law requirements including the requirements of any Federal program for which the State has been authorized, EPA will determine, after consulting with the State as appropriate, if the violation is relevant under the rule and if so, issue an initial determination of unacceptability.</P>
              <P>(2) If a State finds that releases are occurring at a facility regulated under State law or a Federal program for which the State is authorized, EPA will determine, after consulting with the State as appropriate, if the release is relevant under the rule and if so, issue an initial determination of unacceptability.</P>
              <P>(3) EPA may also issue initial determinations of unacceptability based on its own findings. EPA can undertake any inspections, data collection and/or assessments necessary. EPA will then notify with the State about the results and issue a determination notice if a relevant violation or release is found.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of unacceptability.</E> (1) Upon initial determination by the EPA Regional Office that a facility being considered for the off-site transfer of any CERCLA waste does not meet the criteria for acceptability stated in § 300.440(b), the EPA Region shall notify the owner/operator of such facility, and the responsible agency in the State in which the facility is located, of the unacceptability finding. The notice will be sent by certified and first-class mail, return receipt requested. The certified notice, if not acknowledged by the return receipt card, should be considered to have been received by the addressee if properly sent by regular mail to the last address known to the EPA Regional Office.</P>

              <P>(2) The notice shall generally: state that based on available information from a RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA), inspection, or other data sources, the facility has been found not to meet the requirements of § 300.440; cite the specific acts, omissions, or conditions which form the basis of these findings; and inform the owner/operator of the procedural recourse available under this regulation.<PRTPAGE P="85"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) A facility which was previously evaluated and found acceptable under this rule (or the preceding policy) may continue to receive CERCLA waste for 60 calendar days after the date of issuance of the notice, unless otherwise determined in accordance with paragraphs (d)(8) or (d)(9) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If the owner or operator of the facility in question submits a written request for an informal conference with the EPA Regional Office within 10 calendar days from the issuance of the notice, the EPA Regional Office shall provide the opportunity for such conference no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the notice, if possible, to discuss the basis for the underlying violation or release determination, and its relevance to the facility's acceptability to receive CERCLA cleanup wastes. State representatives may attend the informal conference, submit written comments prior to the informal conference, and/or request additional meetings with the EPA Region, relating to the unacceptability issue during the determination process. If no State representative is present, EPA shall notify the State of the outcome of the conference. An owner/operator may submit written comments by the 30th day after issuance of the notice, in addition to or instead of requesting an informal conference.</P>
              <P>(5) If the owner or operator neither requests an informal conference nor submits written comments, the facility becomes unacceptable to receive CERCLA waste on the 60th day after the notice is issued (or on such other date designated under paragraph (d)(9) of this section). The facility will remain unacceptable until such time as the EPA Regional Office notifies the owner or operator otherwise.</P>
              <P>(6) If an informal conference is held or written comments are received, the EPA Region shall decide whether or not the information provided is sufficient to show that the facility is operating in physical compliance with respect to the relevant violations cited in the initial notice of unacceptability, and that all relevant releases have been eliminated or controlled, as required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such that a determination of acceptability would be appropriate. EPA will notify the owner/operator in writing whether or not the information provided is sufficient to support a determination of acceptability. Unless EPA determines that information provided by the owner/operator and the State is sufficient to support a determination of acceptability, the facility becomes unacceptable on the 60th calendar day after issuance of the original notice of unacceptability (or other date established pursuant to paragraphs (d)(8) or (d)(9) of this section).</P>
              <P>(7) Within 10 days of hearing from the EPA Regional Office after the informal conference or the submittal of written comments, the owner/operator or the State may request a reconsideration of the unacceptability determination by the EPA Regional Administrator (RA). Reconsideration may be by review of the record, by conference, or by other means deemed appropriate by the Regional Administrator; reconsideration does not automatically stay the determination beyond the 60-day period. The owner/operator will receive notice in writing of the decision of the RA.</P>
              <P>(8) The EPA Regional Administrator may decide to extend the 60-day period if more time is required to review a submission. The facility owner/operator shall be notified in writing if the Regional Administrator extends the 60 days.</P>
              <P>(9) The EPA Regional Office may decide that a facility's unacceptability is immediately effective (or effective in less than 60 days) in extraordinary situations such as, but not limited to, emergencies at the facility or egregious violations. The EPA Region shall notify the facility owner/operator of the date of unacceptability, and may modify timeframes for comments and other procedures accordingly.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Unacceptability during administrative and judicial challenges of corrective action decisions.</E> For a facility with releases that are subject to a corrective action permit, order, or decree, an administrative or judicial challenge to the corrective action (or a challenge to a permit modification calling for additional corrective action) shall not be considered to be part of a corrective action “program” controlling those releases and shall not act to stay a determination of unacceptability under this <PRTPAGE P="86"/>rule. However, such facility may remain acceptable to receive CERCLA waste during the pendency of the appeal or litigation if:</P>
              <P>(1) It satisfies the EPA Regional Office that adequate interim corrective action measures will continue at the facility; or</P>
              <P>(2) It demonstrates to the EPA Regional Office the absence of a need to take corrective action during the short-term, interim period.</P>
              <FP>Either demonstration may be made during the 60-day review period in the context of the informal conference and RA reconsideration.</FP>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Re-evaluating unacceptability.</E> If, after notification of unacceptability and the opportunity to confer as described in § 300.440(d), the facility remains unacceptable, the facility can regain acceptability. A facility found to be unacceptable to receive CERCLA wastes based on relevant violations or releases may regain acceptability if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Judgment on the merits.</E> The facility has prevailed on the merits in an administrative or judicial challenge to the finding of noncompliance or uncontrolled releases upon which the unacceptability determination was based.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Relevant violations.</E> The facility has demonstrated to the EPA Region its return to physical compliance for the relevant violations cited in the notice.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Releases.</E> The facility has demonstrated to the EPA Region that:</P>
              <P>(i) All releases from receiving units at RCRA subtitle C facilities have been eliminated and prior contamination from such releases is controlled by a corrective action program approved under subtitle C of RCRA;</P>
              <P>(ii) All releases from other units at RCRA subtitle C land disposal facilities are controlled by a corrective action program approved under subtitle C of RCRA;</P>
              <P>(iii) All releases from other units at RCRA subtitle C treatment and storage facilities do not pose a significant threat to human health or the environment, or are controlled by a corrective action program approved under subtitle C of RCRA.</P>
              <P>(iv) A RCRA subtitle C corrective action program may be incorporated into a permit, order, or decree, including the following: a corrective action order under RCRA section 3008(h), section 7003 or section 3013, a RCRA permit under 40 CFR 264.100 or 264.101, or a permit under an equivalent authority in a State authorized for corrective action under RCRA section 3004(u). Releases will be deemed controlled upon issuance of the order, permit, or decree which initiates and requires completion of one or more of the following: a RCRA Facility Investigation, a RCRA Corrective Measures Study, and/or Corrective Measures Implementation. The release remains controlled as long as the facility is in compliance with the order, permit, or decree, and enters into subsequent agreements for implementation of additional corrective action measures when necessary, except during periods of administrative or judicial challenges, when the facility must make a demonstration under § 300.440(e) in order to remain acceptable.</P>
              <P>(v) Facilities with releases regulated under other applicable Federal laws, or State laws under a Federally-delegated program may regain acceptability under this section if the releases are deemed by the EPA Regional Office not to pose a threat to human health or the environment, or if the facility enters into an enforceable agreement under those laws to conduct corrective action activities to control releases. Releases will be deemed controlled upon the issuance of an order, permit, or decree which initiates and requires one or more of the following: a facility investigation, a corrective action study, and/or corrective measures implementation. The release remains controlled as long as the facility is in compliance with the order, permit, or decree, and enters into subsequent agreements for implementation of additional corrective measures when necessary, except during periods of administrative or judicial challenges, when the facility must make a demonstration under § 300.440(e) in order to remain acceptable.</P>

              <P>(4) Prior to the issuance of a determination that a facility has returned to acceptability, the EPA Region shall <PRTPAGE P="87"/>notify the State in which the facility is located, and provide an opportunity for the State to discuss the facility's acceptability status with EPA.</P>
              <P>(5) An unacceptable facility may be reconsidered for acceptability whenever the EPA Regional Office finds that the facility fulfills the criteria stated in § 300.440(b). Upon such a finding, the EPA Regional Office shall notify the facility and the State in writing.</P>

              <P>(a) EPA shall ensure meaningful and substantial state involvement in hazardous substance response as specified in this subpart. EPA shall provide an opportunity for state participation in removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response activities. EPA shall encourage states to enter into an EPA/state Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA) under § 300.505 to increase state involvement and strengthen the EPA/state partnership.</P>
              <P>(b) EPA shall encourage states to participate in Fund-financed response in two ways. Pursuant to § 300.515(a), states may either assume the lead through a cooperative agreement for the response action or may be the support agency in EPA-lead remedial response. Section 300.515 sets forth requirements for state involvement in EPA-lead remedial and enforcement response and also addresses comparable requirements for EPA involvement in state-lead remedial and enforcement response. Section 300.520 specifies requirements for state involvement in EPA-lead enforcement negotiations. Section 300.525 specifies requirements for state involvement in removal actions. In addition to the requirements set forth in this subpart, 40 CFR part 35, subpart O, “Cooperative Agreements and Superfund State Contracts for Superfund Response Actions,” contains further requirements for state participation during response.</P>

              <SUBJECT>EPA/State Superfund Memorandum of Agreement (SMOA).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The SMOA may establish the nature and extent of EPA and state interaction during EPA-lead and state-lead response (Indian tribes meeting the requirements of § 300.515(b) may be treated as states for purposes of this section). EPA shall enter into SMOA discussions if requested by a state. The following may be addressed in a SMOA:</P>
              <P>(1) The EPA/state or Indian tribe relationship for removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response, including a description of the roles and the responsibilities of each.</P>
              <P>(2) The general requirements for EPA oversight. Oversight requirements may be more specifically defined in cooperative agreements.</P>
              <P>(3) The general nature of lead and support agency interaction regarding the review of key documents and/or decision points in removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response. The requirements for EPA and state review of each other's key documents when each is serving as the support agency shall be equivalent to the extent practicable. Review times agreed to in the SMOA must also be documented in site-specific cooperative agreements or Superfund state contracts in order to be binding.</P>
              <P>(4) Procedures for modification of the SMOA (e.g., if EPA and a state agree that the lead and support agency roles and responsibilities have changed, or if modifications are required to achieve desired goals).</P>
              <P>(b) The SMOA and any modifications thereto shall be executed by the EPA Regional Administrator and the head of the state agency designated as lead agency for state implementation of CERCLA.</P>
              <P>(c) Site-specific agreements entered into pursuant to section 104(d)(1) of CERCLA shall be developed in accordance with 40 CFR part 35, subpart O. The SMOA shall not supersede such agreements.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) EPA and the state shall consult annually to determine priorities and make lead and support agency designations for removal, pre-remedial, remedial, and enforcement response to be conducted during the next fiscal year and to discuss future priorities and <PRTPAGE P="88"/>long-term requirements for response. These consultations shall include the exchange of information on both Fund- and non-Fund-financed response activities. The SMOA may describe the timeframe and process for the EPA/state consultation.</P>
              <P>(2) The following activities shall be discussed in the EPA/state consultations established in the SMOA, or otherwise initiated and documented in writing in the absence of a SMOA, on a site-specific basis with EPA and the state identifying the lead agency for each response action discussed:</P>
              <P>(i) Pre-remedial response actions, including preliminary assessments and site inspections;</P>
              <P>(ii) Hazard Ranking System scoring and NPL listing and deletion activities;</P>
              <P>(iii) Remedial phase activities, including remedial investigation/feasibility study, identification of potential applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (ARARs) under federal and state environmental laws and, as appropriate, other advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered (TBCs), proposed plan, ROD, remedial design, remedial action, and operation and maintenance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Potentially responsible party (PRP) searches, notices to PRPs, response to information requests, PRP negotiations, oversight of PRPs, other enforcement actions pursuant to state law, and activities where the state provides support to EPA;</P>
              <P>(v) Compilation and maintenance of the administrative record for selection of a response action as required by subpart I of this part;</P>
              <P>(vi) Related site support activities;</P>
              <P>(vii) State ability to share in the cost and timing of payments; and</P>
              <P>(viii) General CERCLA implementation activities.</P>
              <P>(3) If a state is designated as the lead agency for a non-Fund-financed action at an NPL site, the SMOA shall be supplemented by site-specific enforcement agreements between EPA and the state which specify schedules and EPA involvement.</P>
              <P>(4) In the absence of a SMOA, EPA and the state shall comply with the requirements in § 300.515(h). If the SMOA does not address all of the requirements specified in § 300.515(h), EPA and the state shall comply with any unaddressed requirements in that section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State assurances.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A Fund-financed remedial action undertaken pursuant to CERCLA section 104(a) cannot proceed unless a state provides its applicable required assurances. The assurances must be provided by the state prior to the initiation of remedial action pursuant to a Superfund state contract for EPA-lead (or political subdivision-lead) remedial action or pursuant to a cooperative agreement for a state-lead remedial action. The SMOA may not be used for this purpose. Federally recognized Indian tribes are not required to provide CERCLA section 104(c)(3) assurances for Fund-financed response actions. Further requirements pertaining to state, political subdivision, and federally recognized Indian tribe involvement in CERCLA response are found in 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The state is not required to share in the cost of state- or EPA-lead Fund-financed removal actions (including remedial planning activities associated with remedial actions) conducted pursuant to CERCLA section 104 unless the facility was operated by the state or a political subdivision thereof at the time of disposal of hazardous substances therein and a remedial action is ultimately undertaken at the site. Such remedial planning activities include, but are not limited to, remedial investigations (RIs), feasibility studies (FSs), and remedial design (RD). States shall be required to share 50 percent, or greater, in the cost of all Fund-financed response actions if the facility was publicly operated at the time of the disposal of hazardous substances. For other facilities, except federal facilities, the state shall be required to share 10 percent of the cost of the remedial action.</P>

              <P>(2) CERCLA section 104(c)(5) provides that EPA shall grant a state credit for reasonable, documented, direct, out-of-pocket, non-federal expenditures subject to the limitations specified in CERCLA section 104(c)(5). For a state to apply credit toward its cost share, it must enter into a cooperative agreement or Superfund state contract. The <PRTPAGE P="89"/>state must submit as soon as possible, but no later than at the time CERCLA section 104 assurances are provided for a remedial action, its accounting of eligible credit expenditures for EPA verification. Additional credit requirements are contained in 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.</P>
              <P>(3) Credit may be applied to a state's future cost share requirements at NPL sites for response expenditures or obligations incurred by the state or a political subdivision from January 1, 1978 to December 11, 1980, and for the remedial action expenditures incurred only by the state after October 17, 1986.</P>
              <P>(4) Credit that exceeds the required cost share at the site for which the credit is granted may be transferred to another site to offset a state's required remedial action cost share.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Prior to a Fund-financed remedial action, the state must also provide its assurance in accordance with CERCLA section 104(c)(3)(A) to assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of implemented remedial actions for the expected life of such actions. In addition, when appropriate, as part of the O&amp;M assurance, the state must assure that any institutional controls implemented as part of the remedial action at a site are in place, reliable, and will remain in place after the initiation of O&amp;M. The state and EPA shall consult on a plan for operation and maintenance prior to the initiation of a remedial action.</P>
              <P>(2) After a joint EPA/State inspection of the implemented Fund-financed remedial action under § 300.515(g), EPA may share, for any extension period established in § 300.435(f)(2), in the cost of the operation of the remedy to ensure that the remedy is operational and functional. In the case of restoration of ground or surface water, EPA shall share in the cost of the State's operation of ground- or surface-water restoration remedial actions as specified in § 300.435(f)(3).</P>
              <P>(d) In accordance with CERCLA sections 104 (c)(3)(B) and 121(d)(3), if the remedial action requires off-site storage, destruction, treatment, or disposal, the state must provide its assurance before the remedial action begins on the availability of a hazardous waste disposal facility that is in compliance with CERCLA section 121(d)(3) and is acceptable to EPA.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) In accordance with CERCLA section 104(c)(9), EPA shall not provide any remedial action pursuant to CERCLA section 104 until the state in which the release occurs enters into a cooperative agreement or Superfund state contract with EPA providing assurances deemed adequate by EPA that the state will assure the availability of hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities which:</P>
              <P>(i) Have adequate capacity for the destruction, treatment, or secure disposition of all hazardous wastes that are reasonably expected to be generated within the state during the 20-year period following the date of such cooperative agreement or Superfund state contract and to be destroyed, treated, or disposed;</P>
              <P>(ii) Are within the state, or outside the state in accordance with an interstate agreement or regional agreement or authority;</P>
              <P>(iii) Are acceptable to EPA; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Are in compliance with the requirements of Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.</P>
              <P>(2) This rule does not address whether or not Indian tribes are states for purposes of this paragraph (e).</P>
              <P>(f) EPA may determine that an interest in real property must be acquired in order to conduct a response action. However, as provided in CERCLA section 104(j)(2), EPA may acquire an interest in real estate in order to conduct a remedial action only if the State in which the interest to be acquired is located provides assurances, through a contract, cooperative agreement or otherwise, that the State will accept transfer of the interest upon completion of the remedial action. For purposes of this paragraph, “completion of the remedial action” is the point at which operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) measures would be initiated pursuant to § 300.435(f). The State may accept a transfer of interest at an earlier point in time if agreed upon in writing by the State and EPA. Indian tribe assurances are to be provided as set out at 40 CFR part 35, subpart O, § 35.6110(b)(2).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) States are encouraged to undertake actions authorized under subpart E. Section 104(d)(1) of CERCLA authorizes EPA to enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with a state, political subdivision, or a federally recognized Indian tribe to carry out Fund-financed response actions authorized under CERCLA, when EPA determines that the state, the political subdivision, or federally recognized Indian tribe has the capability to undertake such actions. EPA will use a cooperative agreement to transfer funds to those entities to undertake Fund-financed response activities. The requirements for states, political subdivisions, or Indian tribes to receive funds as a lead or support agency for response are addressed at 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.</P>
              <P>(2) For EPA-lead Fund-financed remedial planning activities, including, but not limited to, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, and remedial designs, the state agency acceptance of the support agency role during an EPA-lead response shall be documented in a letter, SMOA, or cooperative agreement. Superfund state contracts are unnecessary for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(3) Cooperative agreements and Superfund state contracts are only appropriate for non-Fund-financed response actions if a state intends to seek credit for remedial action expenses under § 300.510.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Indian tribe involvement during response.</E> To be afforded substantially the same treatment as states under section 104 of CERCLA, the governing body of the Indian tribe must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be federally recognized; and</P>
              <P>(2) Have a tribal governing body that is currently performing governmental functions to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the affected population or to protect the environment within a defined geographic area; and</P>
              <P>(3) Have jurisdiction over a site at which Fund-financed response, including pre-remedial activities, is contemplated.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">State involvement in PA/SI and National Priorities List process.</E> EPA shall ensure state involvement in the listing and deletion process by providing states opportunities for review, consultation, or concurrence specified in this section.</P>
              <P>(1) EPA shall consult with states as appropriate on the information to be used in developing HRS scores for releases.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA shall, to the extent feasible, provide the state 30 working days to review releases which were scored by EPA and which will be considered for placement on the National Priorities List (NPL).</P>
              <P>(3) EPA shall provide the state 30 working days to review and concur on the Notice of Intent to Delete a release from the NPL. Section 300.425 describes the EPA/state consultation and concurrence process for deleting releases from the NPL.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">State involvement in RI/FS process.</E> A key component of the EPA/state partnership shall be the communication of potential federal and state ARARs and, as appropriate, other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered (TBCs).</P>

              <P>(1) In accordance with §§ 300.400(g) and 300.430, the lead and support agencies shall identify their respective potential ARARs and communicate them to each other in a timely manner, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, no later than the early stages of the comparative analysis described in § 300.430(e)(9), such that sufficient time is available for the lead agency to consider and incorporate all potential ARARs without inordinate delays and duplication of effort. The lead and support agencies may also identify TBCs and communicate them in a timely manner.</P>

              <P>(2) When a state and EPA have entered into a SMOA, the SMOA may specify a consultation process which requires the lead agency to solicit potential ARARs at specified points in the remedial planning and remedy selection processes. At a minimum, the SMOA shall include the points specified in § 300.515(h)(2). The SMOA shall specify timeframes for support agency response to lead agency requests to ensure that potential ARARs are identified and communicated in a timely manner. Such timeframes must also be documented in site-specific agreements. The SMOA may also discuss <PRTPAGE P="91"/>identification and communication of TBCs.</P>
              <P>(3) If EPA in its statement of a proposed plan intends to waive any state-identified ARARs, or does not agree with the state that a certain state standard is an ARAR, it shall formally notify the state when it submits the RI/FS report for state review or responds to the state's submission of the RI/FS report.</P>
              <P>(4) EPA shall respond to state comments on waivers from or disagreements about state ARARs, as well as the preferred alternative when making the RI/FS report and proposed plan available for public comment.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">State involvement in selection of remedy.</E> (1) Both EPA and the state shall be involved in preliminary discussions of the alternatives addressed in the FS prior to preparation of the proposed plan and ROD. At the conclusion of the RI/FS, the lead agency, in conjunction with the support agency, shall develop a proposed plan. The support agency shall have an opportunity to comment on the plan. The lead agency shall publish a notice of availability of the RI/FS report and a brief analysis of the proposed plan pursuant to § 300.430(e) and (f). Included in the proposed plan shall be a statement that the lead and support agencies have reached agreement or, where this is not the case, a statement explaining the concerns of the support agency with the lead agency's proposed plan. The state may not publish a proposed plan that EPA has not approved. EPA may assume the lead from the state if agreement cannot be reached.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) EPA and the state shall identify, at least annually, sites for which RODs will be prepared during the next fiscal year, in accordance with § 300.515(h)(1). For all EPA-lead sites, EPA shall prepare the ROD and provide the state an opportunity to concur with the recommended remedy. For Fund-financed state-lead sites, EPA and the state shall designate sites, in a site-specific agreement, for which the state shall prepare the ROD and seek EPA's concurrence and adoption of the remedy specified therein, and sites for which EPA shall prepare the ROD and seek the state's concurrence. EPA and the state may designate sites for which the state shall prepare the ROD for non-Fund-financed state-lead enforcement response actions (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, actions taken under state law) at an NPL site. The state may seek EPA's concurrence in the remedy specified therein. Either EPA or the state may choose not to designate a site as state-lead.</P>

              <P>(ii) State concurrence on a ROD is not a prerequisite to EPA's selecting a remedy, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, signing a ROD, nor is EPA's concurrence a prerequisite to a state's selecting a remedy at a non-Fund-financed state-lead enforcement site under state law. Unless EPA's Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency Response or Regional Administrator concurs in writing with a state-prepared ROD, EPA shall not be deemed to have approved the state decision. A state may not proceed with a Fund-financed response action unless EPA has first concurred in and adopted the ROD. Section 300.510(a) specifies limitations on EPA's proceeding with a remedial action without state assurances.</P>
              <P>(iii) The lead agency shall provide the support agency with a copy of the signed ROD for remedial actions to be conducted pursuant to CERCLA.</P>
              <P>(iv) On state-lead sites identified for EPA concurrence, the state generally shall be expected to maintain its lead agency status through the completion of the remedial action.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Enhancement of remedy.</E> (1) A state may ask EPA to make changes in or expansions of a remedial action selected under subpart E.</P>
              <P>(i) If EPA finds that the proposed change or expansion is necessary and appropriate to the EPA-selected remedial action, the remedy may be modified (consistent with § 300.435(c)(2)) and any additional costs paid as part of the remedial action.</P>
              <P>(ii) If EPA finds that the proposed change or expansion is not necessary to the selected remedial action, but would not conflict or be inconsistent with the EPA-selected remedy, EPA may agree to integrate the proposed change or expansion into the planned CERCLA remedial work if:</P>

              <P>(A) The state agrees to fund the entire additional cost associated with the change or expansion; and<PRTPAGE P="92"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) The state agrees to assume the lead for supervising the state-funded component of the remedy or, if EPA determines that the state-funded component cannot be conducted as a separate phase or activity, for supervising the remedial design and construction of the entire remedy.</P>
              <P>(2) Where a state does not concur in a remedial action secured by EPA under CERCLA section 106, and the state desires to have the remedial action conform to an ARAR that has been waived under § 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C), a state may seek to have that remedial action so conform, in accordance with the procedures set out in CERCLA section 121(f)(2) .</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">State involvement in remedial design/remedial action.</E> The extent and nature of state involvement during remedial design and remedial action shall be specified in site-specific cooperative agreements or Superfund state contracts, consistent with 40 CFR part 35, subpart O. For Fund-financed remedial actions, the lead and support agencies shall conduct a joint inspection at the conclusion of construction of the remedial action to determine that the remedy has been constructed in accordance with the ROD and with the remedial design.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Requirements for state involvement in absence of SMOA.</E> In the absence of a SMOA, EPA and the state shall comply with the requirements in § 300.515(h). If the SMOA does not address all of the requirements specified in § 300.515(h), EPA and the state shall comply with any unaddressed requirements in that section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Annual consultations.</E> EPA shall conduct consultations with states at least annually to establish priorities and identify and document in writing the lead for remedial and enforcement response for each NPL site within the state for the upcoming fiscal year. States shall be given the opportunity to participate in long-term planning efforts for remedial and enforcement response during these annual consultations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Identification of ARARs and TBCs.</E> The lead and support agencies shall discuss potential ARARs during the scoping of the RI/FS. The lead agency shall request potential ARARs from the support agency no later than the time that the site characterization data are available. The support agency shall communicate in writing those potential ARARs to the lead agency within 30 working days of receipt of the lead agency request for these ARARs. The lead and support agencies may also discuss and communicate other pertinent advisories, criteria, or guidance to be considered (TBCs). After the initial screening of alternatives has been completed but prior to initiation of the comparative analysis conducted during the detailed analysis phase of the FS, the lead agency shall request that the support agency communicate any additional requirements that are applicable or relevant and appropriate to the alternatives contemplated within 30 working days of receipt of this request. The lead agency shall thereafter consult the support agency to ensure that identified ARARs and TBCs are updated as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Support agency review of lead agency documents.</E> The lead agency shall provide the support agency an opportunity to review and comment on the RI/FS, proposed plan, ROD, and remedial design, and any proposed determinations on potential ARARs and TBCs. The support agency shall have a minimum of 10 working days and a maximum of 15 working days to provide comments to the lead agency on the RI/FS, ROD, ARAR/TBC determinations, and remedial design. The support agency shall have a minimum of five working days and a maximum of 10 working days to comment on the proposed plan.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Administrative record requirements.</E> The state, where it is the lead agency for a Fund-financed site, shall compile and maintain the administrative record for selection of a response action under subpart I of this part unless specified otherwise in the SMOA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Designation of federal trustees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The President is required to designate in the NCP those federal officials who are to act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural resources. Federal officials so designated will act pursuant to section 107(f) of CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, and section 1006 of the OPA. Natural resources means land, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, ground water, drinking water supplies, and other such resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled (hereinafter referred to as “managed or controlled”) by the United States (including the resources of the exclusive economic zone).</P>
              <P>(b) The following individuals shall be the designated trustee(s) for general categories of natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems. They are authorized to act pursuant to section 107(f) of CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, or section 1006 of the OPA when there is injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, as a result of a release of a hazardous substance or a discharge of oil. Notwithstanding the other designations in this section, the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior shall act as trustees of those resources subject to their respective management or control.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Secretary of Commerce.</E> The Secretary of Commerce shall act as trustee for natural resources managed or controlled by DOC and for natural resources managed or controlled by other federal agencies and that are found in, under, or using waters navigable by deep draft vessels, tidally influenced waters, or waters of the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, and the outer continental shelf. However, before the Secretary takes an action with respect to an affected resource under the management or control of another federal agency, he shall, whenever practicable, seek to obtain the concurrence of that other federal agency. Examples of the Secretary's trusteeship include the following natural resources and their supporting ecosystems: marine fishery resources; anadromous fish; endangered species and marine mammals; and the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries and National Estuarine Research Reserves.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Secretary of the Interior.</E> The Secretary of the Interior shall act as <PRTPAGE P="94"/>trustee for natural resources managed or controlled by the DOI. Examples of the Secretary's trusteeship include the following natural resources and their supporting ecosystems: migratory birds; anadromous fish; endangered species and marine mammals; federally owned minerals; and certain federally managed water resources. The Secretary of the Interior shall also be trustee for those natural resources for which an Indian tribe would otherwise act as trustee in those cases where the United States acts on behalf of the Indian tribe.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Secretary for the land managing agency.</E> For natural resources located on, over, or under land administered by the United States, the trustee shall be the head of the department in which the land managing agency is found. The trustees for the principal federal land managing agencies are the Secretaries of DOI, USDA, DOD, and DOE.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Head of authorized agencies.</E> For natural resources located in the United States but not otherwise described in this section, the trustee shall be the head of the federal agency or agencies authorized to manage or control those resources.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional trustees for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.</E> The Administrator of EPA and the Secretary of Agriculture shall act as trustees in connection with injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, resulting from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.</P>

              <P>State trustees shall act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, within the boundary of a state or belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such state. For the purposes of subpart G of this part, the definition of the term <E T="03">state</E> does not include Indian tribes. The governor of a state is encouraged to designate a state lead trustee to coordinate all state trustee responsibilities with other trustee agencies and with response activities of the RRT and OSC. The state's lead trustee would designate a representative to serve as contact with the OSC. This individual should have ready access to appropriate state officials with environmental protection, emergency response, and natural resource responsibilities. The EPA Administrator or USCG Commandant or their designees may appoint the state lead trustee as a member of the Area Committee. Response strategies should be coordinated between the state and other trustees and the OSC for specific natural resource locations in an inland or coastal zone and should be included in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex of the ACP.</P>

              <P>(a) Where there are multiple trustees, because of coexisting or contiguous natural resources or concurrent jurisdictions, they should coordinate and <PRTPAGE P="95"/>cooperate in carrying out these responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(b) Trustees are responsible for designating to the RRTs and the Area Committees, for inclusion in the RCP and the ACP, appropriate contacts to receive notifications from the OSCs/RPMs of discharges or releases.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural resources, trustees may, pursuant to section 107(f) of CERCLA, or section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, take the following or other actions as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) Conduct a preliminary survey of the area affected by the discharge or release to determine if trust resources under their jurisdiction are, or potentially may be, affected;</P>
              <P>(ii) Cooperate with the OSC/RPM in coordinating assessments, investigations, and planning;</P>
              <P>(iii) Carry out damage assessments; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Devise and carry out a plan for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural resources. In assessing damages to natural resources, the federal, state, and Indian tribe trustees have the option of following the procedures for natural resource damage assessments located at 43 CFR part 11.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon notification or discovery of injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources, or the potential for such, resulting from a discharge of oil occurring after August 18, 1990, the trustees, pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, are to take the following actions:</P>
              <P>(i) In accordance with OPA section 1006(c), determine the need for assessment of natural resource damages, collect data necessary for a potential damage assessment, and, where appropriate, assess damages to natural resources under their trusteeship; and</P>
              <P>(ii) As appropriate, and subject to the public participation requirements of OPA section 1006(c), develop and implement a plan for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent, of the natural resources under their trusteeship;</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The trustees, consistent with procedures specified in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan Annex to the Area Contingency Plan, shall provide timely advice on recommended actions concerning trustee resources that are potentially affected by a discharge of oil. This may include providing assistance to the OSC in identifying/recommending pre-approved response techniques and in predesignating shoreline types and areas in ACPs.</P>
              <P>(ii) The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that the OSC is informed of their activities regarding natural resource damage assessment that may affect response operations in order to assure coordination and minimize any interference with such operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment activities that may support more effective operational decisions are provided in a timely manner to the OSC.</P>
              <P>(iii) When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of federal response resources (including but not limited to aircraft, vessels, and booms to contain and remove discharged oil) with the trustees, providing trustee activities do not interfere with response actions. The lead administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also responsible for applying to the NPFC for funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural resources.</P>
              <P>(d) The authority of federal trustees includes, but is not limited to the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Requesting that the Attorney General seek compensation from the responsible parties for the damages assessed and for the costs of an assessment and of restoration planning; and</P>

              <P>(2) Participating in negotiations between the United States and potentially responsible parties to obtain PRP-financed or PRP-conducted assessments and restorations for injured resources or protection for threatened <PRTPAGE P="96"/>resources and to agree to covenants not to sue, where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) Requiring, in consultation with the lead agency, any person to comply with the requirements of CERCLA section 104(e) regarding information gathering and access.</P>
              <P>(4) Initiating damage assessments, as provided in OPA section 6002.</P>
              <P>(e) Actions which may be taken by any trustee pursuant to section 107(f) of CERCLA, section 311(f)(5) of the CWA, or section 1006 of the OPA include, but are not limited to, any of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Requesting that an authorized agency issue an administrative order or pursue injunctive relief against the parties responsible for the discharge or release; or</P>
              <P>(2) Requesting that the lead agency remove, or arrange for the removal of, or provide for remedial action with respect to, any oil or hazardous substances from a contaminated medium pursuant to section 104 of CERCLA or section 311 of CWA.</P>

              <P>(3) Section 106(b), wherein any person who has complied with a section 106(a) order may petition the Fund for reimbursement of reasonable costs, plus interest; and</P>
              <P>(4) Section 123, wherein a general purpose unit of local government may apply to the Fund under 40 CFR part 310 for reimbursement of the costs of temporary emergency measures that are necessary to prevent or mitigate injury to human health or the environment associated with a release.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Section 107(a) cost recovery actions.</E> (1) Responsible parties shall be liable for all response costs incurred by the United States government or a state or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the NCP.</P>
              <P>(2) Responsible parties shall be liable for necessary costs of response actions to releases of hazardous substances incurred by any other person consistent with the NCP.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purpose of cost recovery under section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA:</P>
              <P>(i) A private party response action will be considered “consistent with the NCP” if the action, when evaluated as a whole, is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this section, and results in a CERCLA-quality cleanup; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Any response action carried out in compliance with the terms of an order issued by EPA pursuant to section 106 of CERCLA, or a consent decree entered into pursuant to section 122 of CERCLA, will be considered “consistent with the NCP.”</P>
              <P>(4) Actions under § 300.700(c)(1) will not be considered “inconsistent with the NCP,” and actions under § 300.700(c)(2) will not be considered not “consistent with the NCP,” based on immaterial or insubstantial deviations from the provisions of 40 CFR part 300.</P>
              <P>(5) The following provisions of this part are potentially applicable to private party response actions:</P>

              <P>(vi) Section 300.415 (on removal actions) except paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2)(vii), (b)(5), and (g); and including § 300.415(j) with regard to meeting ARARs where practicable except that private party removal actions must always comply with the requirements of applicable law;</P>
              <P>(vii) Section 300.420 (on remedial site evaluation);</P>
              <P>(viii) Section 300.430 (on RI/FS and selection of remedy) except paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(C)(6) and that applicable requirements of federal or state law may not be waived by a private party; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Section 300.435 (on RD/RA and operation and maintenance).</P>
              <P>(6) Private parties undertaking response actions should provide an opportunity for public comment concerning the selection of the response action based on the provisions set out below, or based on substantially equivalent state and local requirements. The following provisions of this part regarding public participation are potentially applicable to private party response actions, with the exception of administrative record and information repository requirements stated therein:</P>

              <P>(7) When selecting the appropriate remedial action, the methods of remedying releases listed in appendix D of this part may also be appropriate to a private party response action.</P>
              <P>(8) Except for actions taken pursuant to CERCLA sections 104 or 106 or response actions for which reimbursement from the Fund will be sought, any action to be taken by the lead agency listed in paragraphs (c)(5) through (c)(7) may be taken by the person carrying out the response action.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Section 111(a)(2) claims.</E> (1) Persons, other than those listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, may be able to receive reimbursement of response costs by means of a claim against the Fund.

              <P>(i) Federal government;</P>
              <P>(ii) State governments, and their political subdivisions, unless they are potentially responsible parties covered by an order or consent decree pursuant to section 122 of CERCLA; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Persons operating under a procurement contract or an assistance agreement with the United States with respect to matters covered by that contract or assistance agreement, unless specifically provided therein.</P>

              <P>(2) In order to be reimbursed by the Fund, an eligible person must notify the Administrator of EPA or designee prior to taking a response action and receive prior approval, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, “preauthorization,” for such action.</P>
              <P>(3) Preauthorization is EPA's prior approval to submit a claim against the Fund for necessary response costs incurred as a result of carrying out the NCP. All applications for preauthorization will be reviewed to determine whether the request should receive priority for funding. EPA, in its discretion, may grant preauthorization of a claim. Preauthorization will be considered only for:</P>
              <P>(i) Removal actions pursuant to § 300.415;</P>
              <P>(ii) CERCLA section 104(b) activities; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Remedial actions at National Priorities List sites pursuant to § 300.435.</P>
              <P>(4) To receive EPA's prior approval, the eligible person must:</P>
              <P>(i) Demonstrate technical and other capabilities to respond safely and effectively to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Establish that the action will be consistent with the NCP in accordance with the elements set forth in paragraphs (c)(5) through (8) of this section.</P>

              <P>(5) EPA will grant preauthorization to a claim by a party it determines to <PRTPAGE P="98"/>be potentially liable under section 107 of CERCLA only in accordance with an order issued pursuant to section 106 of CERCLA, or a settlement with the federal government in accordance with section 122 of CERCLA.</P>
              <P>(6) Preauthorization does not establish an enforceable contractual relationship between EPA and the claimant.</P>
              <P>(7) Preauthorization represents EPA's commitment that if funds are appropriated for response actions, the response action is conducted in accordance with the preauthorization decision document, and costs are reasonable and necessary, reimbursement will be made from the Superfund, up to the maximum amount provided in the preauthorization decision document.</P>
              <P>(8) For a claim to be awarded under section 111 of CERCLA, EPA must certify that the costs were necessary and consistent with the preauthorization decision document.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Section 106(b) petition.</E> Subject to conditions specified in CERCLA section 106(b), any person who has complied with an order issued after October 16, 1986 pursuant to section 106(a) of CERCLA, may seek reimbursement for response costs incurred in complying with that order unless the person has waived that right.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Section 123 reimbursement to local governments.</E> Any general purpose unit of local government for a political subdivision that is affected by a release may receive reimbursement for the costs of temporary emergency measures necessary to prevent or mitigate injury to human health or the environment subject to the conditions set forth in 40 CFR part 310. Such reimbursement may not exceed $25,000 for a single response.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Release From Liability.</E> Implementation of response measures by potentially responsible parties or by any other person does not release those parties from liability under section 107(a) of CERCLA, except as provided in a settlement under section 122 of CERCLA or a federal court judgment.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Oil Pollution Act Claims.</E> Claims are authorized to be presented to the OSLTF under section 1013 of the OPA, for certain uncompensated removal costs or uncompensated damages resulting from the discharge, or substantial threat of discharge, of oil from a vessel or facility into or upon the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or exclusive economic zone of the United States. Anyone desiring to file a claim against the OSLTF may obtain general information on the procedure for filing a claim from the Director, National Pollution Funds Center, Suite 1000, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1804, (703) 235-4756.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Authorization of use.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) RRTs and Area Committees shall address, as part of their planning activities, the desirability of using appropriate dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents listed on the NCP Product Schedule, and the desirability of using appropriate burning agents. RCPs and ACPs shall, as appropriate, include applicable preauthorization plans and address the specific contexts in which such products should and should not be used. In meeting the provisions of this paragraph, preauthorization plans may address factors such as the potential sources and types of oil that might be spilled, the existence and location of environmentally sensitive resources that might be impacted by spilled oil, <PRTPAGE P="103"/>available product and storage locations, available equipment and adequately trained operators, and the available means to monitor product application and effectiveness. The RRT representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees shall review and either approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the preauthorization plans developed by Area Committees, as appropriate. Approved preauthorization plans shall be included in the appropriate RCPs and ACPs. If the RRT representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees approve in advance the use of certain products under specified circumstances as described in the preauthorization plan, the OSC may authorize the use of the products without obtaining the specific concurrences described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) For spill situations that are not addressed by the preauthorization plans developed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the release or discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents on the oil discharge, provided that the products are listed on the NCP Product Schedule.</P>
              <P>(c) The OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the release or discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of burning agents on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(d) The OSC may authorize the use of any dispersant, surface washing agent, surface collecting agent, other chemical agent, burning agent, bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent, including products not listed on the NCP Product Schedule, without obtaining the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the release or discharge, when, in the judgment of the OSC, the use of the product is necessary to prevent or substantially reduce a hazard to human life. Whenever the OSC authorizes the use of a product pursuant to this paragraph, the OSC is to inform the EPA RRT representative and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the affected states and, when practicable, the DOC/DOI natural resources trustees of the use of a product, including products not on the Schedule, as soon as possible. Once the threat to human life has subsided, the continued use of a product shall be in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Sinking agents shall not be authorized for application to oil discharges.</P>
              <P>(f) When developing preauthorization plans, RRTs may require the performance of supplementary toxicity and effectiveness testing of products, in addition to the test methods specified in § 300.915 and described in appendix C to part 300, due to existing site-specific or area-specific concerns.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Addition of products to Schedule.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Dispersants.</E> (1) To add a dispersant to the NCP Product Schedule, submit the technical product data specified in § 300.915(a) to the Emergency Response Division (5202-G), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. A dispersant must attain an effectiveness value of 45 percent or greater in order to be added to the Schedule.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA reserves the right to request further documentation of the manufacturers' test results. EPA also reserves the right to verify test results and consider the results of EPA's verification testing in determining whether the dispersant meets listing criteria. EPA will, within 60 days of receiving a complete application as specified in § 300.915(a) of this part, notify the manufacturer of its decision to list the product on the Schedule, or request additional information and/or a sample of the product in order to review and/or conduct validation sampling. If EPA requests additional information and/or a product sample, within 60 days of receiving such additional information or sample, EPA will then notify the manufacturer in writing of its decision to list or not list the product.</P>
              <P>(3) Request for review of decision. (i) A manufacturer whose product was determined to be ineligible for listing on the NCP Product Schedule may request EPA's Administrator to review the determination. The request must be made in writing within 30 days of receiving notification of EPA's decision to not list the dispersant on the Schedule. The request shall contain a clear and concise statement with supporting facts and technical analysis demonstrating that EPA's decision was incorrect.</P>

              <P>(ii) The Administrator or his designee may request additional information from the manufacturer, or from <PRTPAGE P="109"/>any other person, and may provide for a conference between EPA and the manufacturer, if appropriate. The Administrator or his designee shall render a decision within 60 days of receiving the request, or within 60 days of receiving requested additional information, if appropriate, and shall notify the manufacturer of his decision in writing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents.</E> (1) To add a surface washing agent, surface collecting agent, bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent to the NCP Product Schedule, the technical product data specified in § 300.915 must be submitted to the Emergency Response Division (5202-G), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. If EPA determines that the required data were submitted, EPA will add the product to the Schedule.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA will inform the submitter in writing, within 60 days of the receipt of technical product data, of its decision on adding the product to the Schedule.</P>
              <P>(c) The submitter may assert that certain information in the technical product data submissions, including technical product data submissions for sorbents pursuant to § 300.915(g)(3), is confidential business information. EPA will handle such claims pursuant to the provisions in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. Such information must be submitted separately from non-confidential information, clearly identified, and clearly marked “Confidential Business Information.” If the submitter fails to make such a claim at the time of submittal, EPA may make the information available to the public without further notice.</P>
              <P>(d) The submitter must notify EPA of any changes in the composition, formulation, or application of the dispersant, surface washing agent, surface collecting agent, bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent. On the basis of this data, EPA may require retesting of the product if the change is likely to affect the effectiveness or toxicity of the product.</P>
              <P>(e) The listing of a product on the NCP Product Schedule does not constitute approval of the product. To avoid possible misinterpretation or misrepresentation, any label, advertisement, or technical literature that refers to the placement of the product on the NCP Product Schedule must either reproduce in its entirety EPA's written statement that it will add the product to the NCP Product Schedule under § 300.920(a)(2) or (b)(2), or include the disclaimer shown below. If the disclaimer is used, it must be conspicuous and must be fully reproduced. Failure to comply with these restrictions or any other improper attempt to demonstrate the approval of the product by any NRT or other U.S. Government agency shall constitute grounds for removing the product from the NCP Product Schedule.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Introduction</HD>
              <P>The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) is the principal mechanism the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses to place sites on the National Priorities List (NPL). The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate the potential for releases of uncontrolled hazardous substances to cause human health or environmental damage. The HRS provides a measure of relative rather than absolute risk. It is designed so that it can be consistently applied to a wide variety of sites.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.1 Definitions</HD>

                <E T="03">Bioconcentration factor (BCF):</E> Measure of the tendency for a substance to accumulate in the tissue of an aquatic organism. BCF is determined by the extent of partitioning of a substance, at equilibrium, between the tissue of an aquatic organism and water. As the ratio of concentration of a substance in the organism divided by the concentration in water, higher BCF values reflect a tendency for substances to accumulate in the tissue of aquatic organisms. [unitless].</P>

              <P>• Surface Water Migration (S<E T="52">sw</E>).</P>

              </P>
              <P>• Air Migration (S<E T="52">a</E>).</P>
              <P>The ground water and air migration pathways use single threat evaluations, while the surface water migration and soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathways use multiple threat evaluations. Three threats are evaluated for the surface water migration pathway: Drinking water, human food chain, and environmental. These threats are evaluated for two separate migration components—overland/flood migration and ground water to surface water migration. Two components are evaluated for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway: Soil exposure and subsurface intrusion. The soil exposure component evaluates two threats: Resident population and nearby population, and the subsurface intrusion component is a single threat evaluation.</P>
              <P>The HRS is structured to provide a parallel evaluation for each of these pathways, components, and threats. This section focuses on these parallel evaluations, starting with the calculation of the HRS site score and the individual pathway scores.</P>
              <P>2.1.1 <E T="03">Calculation of HRS site score.</E> Scores are first calculated for the individual pathways as specified in sections 2 through 7 and then are combined for the site using the following root-mean-square equation to determine the overall HRS site score, which ranges from 0 to 100:</P>

              <P>2.1.2 <E T="03">Calculation of pathway score.</E> Table 2-1, which is based on the air migration pathway, illustrates the basic parameters used to calculate a pathway score. As Table 2-1 shows, each pathway (component or threat) score is the product of three “factor categories”: Likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets. (The soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway uses likelihood of exposure rather than likelihood of release.) Each of the three factor categories contains a set of factors that are assigned numerical values and combined as specified in sections 2 through 7. The factor values are rounded to the nearest integer, except where otherwise noted.</P>

              <P>These evaluations are essentially identical for the three migration pathways (ground water, surface water, and air). However, the evaluations differ in certain respects for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway.</P>
              <P>Section 7 specifies modifications that apply to each pathway when evaluating sites containing radioactive substances.</P>
              <P>Section 2 focuses on evaluations common at the pathway, component, and threat levels. Note that for the ground water and surface water migration pathways, separate scores are calculated for each aquifer (see section 3.0) and each watershed (see sections 4.1.1.3 and 4.2.1.5) when determining the pathway scores for a site. Although the evaluations in section 2 do not vary when different aquifers or watersheds are scored at a site, the specific factor values (for example, observed release, hazardous waste quantity, toxicity/mobility) that result from these evaluations can vary by aquifer and by watershed at the site. This can occur through differences both in the specific sources and targets eligible to be evaluated for each aquifer and watershed and in whether observed releases can be established for each aquifer and watershed. Such differences in scoring at the aquifer and watershed level are addressed in sections 3 and 4, not section 2.</P>

              <P>2.4.1.1 <E T="03">Toxicity factor.</E> Evaluate toxicity for those hazardous substances at the site that are available to the pathway being scored. For all pathways and threats, except the surface water environmental threat, evaluate human toxicity as specified below. For the surface water environmental threat, evaluate ecosystem toxicity as specified in section 4.1.4.2.1.1.</P>
              <P>Establish human toxicity factor values based on quantitative dose-response parameters for the following three types of toxicity:</P>

              <P>• Cancer—Use slope factors (also referred to as cancer potency factors) combined with <PRTPAGE P="124"/>weight-of-evidence ratings for carcinogenicity for all exposure routes except inhalation. Use inhalation unit risk (IUR) for inhalation exposure. If an inhalation unit risk or a slope factor is not available for a substance, use its ED<E T="52">10</E> value to estimate a slope factor as follows:</P>

                <GID>ER09JA17.063</GID>
              </GPH>
              <P>• Noncancer toxicological responses of chronic exposure—use reference dose (RfD) or reference concentration (RfC) values as applicable.</P>

              <P>• Noncancer toxicological responses of acute exposure—use acute toxicity parameters, such as the LD<E T="52">50</E>.</P>
              <P>Assign human toxicity factor values to a hazardous substance using Table 2-4, as follows:</P>
              <P>• If RfD/RfC and slope factor/inhalation unit risk values are available for the hazardous substance, assign the substance a value from Table 2-4 for each. Select the higher of the two values assigned and use it as the overall toxicity factor value for the hazardous substance.</P>
              <P>• If either an RfD/RfC or slope factor/inhalation unit risk value is available, but not both, assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity factor value from Table 2-4 based solely on the available value (RfD/RfC or slope factor/inhalation unit risk).</P>
              <P>• If neither an RfD/RfC nor slope factor/inhalation unit risk value is available, assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity factor value from Table 2-4 based solely on acute toxicity. That is, consider acute toxicity in Table 2-4 only when both RfD/RfC and slope factor/IUR values are not available.</P>
              <P>• If neither an RfD/RfC, nor slope factor/inhalation unit risk, nor acute toxicity value is available, assign the hazardous substance an overall toxicity factor value of 0 and use other hazardous substances for which information is available in evaluating the pathway.</P>

              </P>
              <P>3.0.1.1 <E T="03">Ground water target distance limit.</E> The target distance limit defines the maximum distance from the sources at the site over which targets are evaluated. Use a target distance limit of 4 miles for the ground water migration pathway, except when aquifer discontinuities apply (see section 3.0.1.2.2). Furthermore, consider any well with an observed release from a source at the site (see section 3.1.1) to lie within the target distance limit of the site, regardless of the well's distance from the sources at the site.</P>
              <P>For sites that consist solely of a contaminated ground water plume with no identified source, begin measuring the 4-mile target distance limit at the center of the area of observed ground water contamination. Determine the area of observed ground water contamination based on available samples that meet the criteria for an observed release.</P>
              <P>3.0.1.2<E T="03"> Aquifer boundaries.</E> Combine multiple aquifers into a single hydrologic unit for scoring purposes if aquifer interconnections can be established for these aquifers. In contrast, restrict aquifer boundaries if aquifer discontinuities can be established.</P>
              <P>3.0.1.2.1<E T="03"> Aquifer interconnections.</E> Evaluate whether aquifer interconnections occur within 2 miles of the sources at the site. If they occur within this 2-mile distance, combine the aquifers having interconnections in scoring the site. In addition, if observed ground water contamination attributable to the sources at the site extends beyond 2 miles from the sources, use any locations within the limits of this observed ground water contamination in evaluating aquifer interconnections. If data are not adequate to establish aquifer interconnections, evaluate the aquifers as separate aquifers.</P>
              <P>3.0.1.2.2 <E T="03">Aquifer discontinuities.</E> Evaluate whether aquifer discontinuities occur within the 4-mile target distance limit. An aquifer discontinuity occurs for scoring purposes only when a geologic, topographic, or other structure or feature entirely transects an aquifer within the 4-mile target distance limit, thereby creating a continuous boundary to ground water flow within this limit. If two or more aquifers can be combined into a single hydrologic unit for scoring purposes, an aquifer discontinuity occurs only when the structure or feature entirely transects the boundaries of this single hydrologic unit.</P>
              <P>When an aquifer discontinuity is established within the 4-mile target distance limit, exclude that portion of the aquifer beyond the discontinuity in evaluating the ground water migration pathway. However, if hazardous substances have migrated across an apparent discontinuity within the 4-mile target distance limit, do not consider this to be a discontinuity in scoring the site.</P>
              <P>3.0.1.3 <E T="03"> Karst aquifer.</E> Give a karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at <PRTPAGE P="136"/>the site special consideration in the evaluation of two potential to release factors (depth to aquifer in section 3.1.2.3 and travel time in section 3.1.2.4), one waste characteristics factor (mobility in section 3.2.1.2), and two targets factors (nearest well in section 3.3.1 and potential contamination in section 3.3.2.4).</P>
              <P>3.1 <E T="03">Likelihood of release.</E> For an aquifer, evaluate the likelihood of release factor category in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.</P>
              <P>3.1.1 <E T="03">Observed release.</E> Establish an observed release to an aquifer by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the aquifer. Base this demonstration on either:</P>
              <P>• Direct observation—a material that contains one or more hazardous substances has been deposited into or has been observed entering the aquifer.</P>

              <P>• Chemical analysis—an analysis of ground water samples from the aquifer indicates that the concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site (see section 2.3). Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release, except: when the source itself consists of a ground water plume with no identified source, no separate attribution is required.
              </P>
              <P>If an observed release can be established for the aquifer, assign the aquifer an observed release factor value of 550, enter this value in table 3-1, and proceed to section 3.1.3. If an observed release cannot be established for the aquifer, assign an observed release factor value of 0, enter this value in table 3-1, and proceed to section 3.1.2.</P>
              <P>3.1.2 <E T="03">Potential to release.</E> Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established for the aquifer. Evaluate potential to release based on four factors: containment, net precipitation, depth to aquifer, and travel time. For sources overlying karst terrain, give any karst aquifer that underlies any portion of the sources at the site special consideration in evaluating depth to aquifer and travel time, as specified in sections 3.1.2.3 and 3.1.2.4.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.1 <E T="03">Containment.</E> Assign a containment factor value from table 3-2 to each source at the site. Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources with a source hazardous waste quantity value of 0.5 or more (see section 2.4.2.1.5). (Do not include this minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this pathway.) Assign this highest value as the containment factor value for the aquifer being evaluated. Enter this value in Table ­3-1.</P>
              <P>If no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then select the highest value assigned to the sources at the site and assign it as the containment factor value for the aquifer being evaluated. Enter this value in table 3-1.</P>
              <P>3.1.2.2 <E T="03">Net precipitation.</E> Assign a net precipitation factor value to the site. Figure 3-2 provides computed net precipitation factor values, based on site location. Where necessary, determine the net precipitation factor value as follows:</P>
              <P>• Determine monthly precipitation and monthly evapotranspiration:</P>
              <P SOURCE="P-1">-Use local measured monthly averages.</P>

              <P>3.3.2 <E T="03">Population.</E> In evaluating the population factor, include those persons served by drinking water wells within the target distance limit specified in section 3.0.1.1. For the aquifer being evaluated, count those persons served by wells in that aquifer and those persons served by wells in overlying aquifers as specified in section 3.0. Include residents, students, and workers who regularly use the water. Exclude transient populations such as customers and travelers passing through the area. Evaluate the population based on the location of the water supply wells, not on the location of residences, work places, etc. When a standby well is maintained on a regular basis so that water can be withdrawn, include it in evaluating the population factor.</P>
              <P>In estimating residential population, when the estimate is based on the number of residences, multiply each residence by the average number of persons per residence for the county in which the residence is located.</P>
              <P>In determining the population served by a well, if the water from the well is blended with other water (for example, water from other ground water wells or surface water intakes), apportion the total population regularly served by the blended system to the well based on the well's relative contribution to the total blended system. In estimating the well's relative contribution, assume each well and intake contributes equally and apportion the population accordingly, except: if the relative contribution of any one well or intake exceeds 40 percent based on average annual pumpage or capacity, estimate the relative contribution of the wells and intakes considering the following data, if available:</P>
              <P>• Average annual pumpage from the ground water wells and surface water intakes in the blended system.</P>
              <P>• Capacities of the wells and intakes in the blended system.</P>
              <P>For systems with standby ground water wells or standby surface water intakes, apportion the total population regularly served by the blended system as described above, except:</P>
              <P>• Exclude standby surface water intakes in apportioning the population.</P>
              <P>• When using pumpage data for a standby ground water well, use average pumpage for the period during which the standby well is used rather than average annual pumpage.</P>
              <P>• For that portion of the total population that could be apportioned to a standby ground water well, assign that portion of the population either to that standby well or to the other ground water well(s) and surface water intake(s) that serve that population; do not assign that portion of the population both to the standby well and to the other well(s) and intake(s) in the blended system. Use the apportioning that results in the highest population factor value. (Either include all standby well(s) or exclude some or all of the standby well(s) as appropriate to obtain this highest value.) Note that the specific standby well(s) included or excluded and, thus, the specific apportioning may vary in evaluating different aquifers and in evaluating the surface water pathway.</P>

              <P>If no samples meet the criteria for an observed release for a point of withdrawal and there is no observed release by direct observation for that point of withdrawal, evaluate that point of withdrawal using the potential contamination factor in section 3.3.2.4. If <PRTPAGE P="146"/>there is an observed release by direct observation, use Level II concentrations for that point of withdrawal. However, if one or more samples meet the criteria for an observed release for the point of withdrawal, determine which factor (Level I or Level II concentrations) applies to that point of withdrawal as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from table 3-10 in determining the level of contamination. Evaluate the point of withdrawal using the Level I concentrations factor in section 3.3.2.2 or the Level II concentrations factor in section 3.3.2.3, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>For the potential contamination factor, use population ranges in evaluating the factor as specified in section 3.3.2.4. For the Level I and Level II concentrations factors, use the population estimate, not population ranges, in evaluating both factors.</P>

              <P>• Select the highest overland/flood migration component score from the watersheds evaluated and assign it as the overland/flood migration component score for the site.
              </P>
              <P>4.1.2 <E T="03">Drinking water threat.</E> Evaluate the drinking water threat for each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets.</P>
              <P>4.1.2.1 <E T="03">Drinking water threat—likelihood of release.</E> Evaluate the likelihood of release factor category for each watershed in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.</P>
              <P>4.1.2.1.1 <E T="03">Observed release.</E> Establish an observed release to surface water for a watershed by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the surface water in the watershed. Base this demonstration on either:
              </P>
              <P>• Direct observation:
              </P>
              <P SOURCE="P-1">-A material that contains one or more hazardous substances has been seen entering surface water through migration or is known to have entered surface water through direct deposition, or</P>
              <P SOURCE="P-1">-A source area has been flooded at a time that hazardous substances were present, and one or more hazardous substances were in contact with the flood waters, or</P>
              
              <P SOURCE="P-1">-When evidence supports the inference of a release of a material that contains one or more hazardous substances by the site to surface water, demonstrated adverse effects associated with that release may also be used to establish an observed release.</P>
              <P>• Chemical analysis:
              </P>
              <P SOURCE="P-1">-Analysis of surface water, benthic, or sediment samples indicates that the concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site for that type of sample (see section 2.3).</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">-Limit comparisons to similar types of samples and background concentrations—for example, compare surface water samples to surface water background concentrations.</FP>

              <P SOURCE="P-1">-Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release, except: when the site itself consists of contaminated sediments with no identified source, no separate attribution is required.</P>
              <P>If an observed release can be established for a watershed, assign an observed release factor value of 550 to that watershed, enter this value in table 4-1, and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.3. If no observed release can be established for the watershed, assign an observed release factor value of 0 to that watershed, enter this value in table 4-1, and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.</P>
              <P>4.1.2.1.2 <E T="03">Potential to release.</E> Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established for the watershed. Evaluate potential to release based on two components: potential to release by overland flow (see section 4.1.2.1.2.1) and potential to release by flood (see section 4.1.2.1.2.2). Sum the values for these two components to obtain the potential to release factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum value of 500.</P>
              <P>4.1.2.1.2.1 <E T="03">Potential to release by overland flow.</E> Evaluate potential to release by overland flow for the watershed based on three factors: containment, runoff, and distance to surface water.</P>
              <P>Assign potential to release by overland flow a value of 0 for the watershed if:</P>
              <P>• No overland segment of the hazardous substance migration path can be defined for the watershed, or</P>

              <P>• The overland segment of the hazardous substance migration path for the watershed exceeds 2 miles before surface water is encountered.
              </P>
              <FP>If either condition applies, enter a value of 0 in table 4-1 and proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.2 to evaluate potential to release by flood. If neither applies, proceed to section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 to evaluate potential to release by overland flow.</FP>
              <P>4.1.2.1.2.1.1 <E T="03">Containment.</E> Determine the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:</P>

              <P>• If one or more sources is located in surface water in the watershed (for example, intact sealed drums in surface water), assign <PRTPAGE P="153"/>the containment factor a value of 10 for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.</P>

              <P>• If none of the sources is located in surface water in the watershed, assign a containment factor value from table 4-2 to each source at the site that can potentially release hazardous substances to the hazardous substance migration path for this watershed. Assign the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:
              </P>
              <P SOURCE="P-1">-Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources that meet the minimum size requirement described below. Assign this highest value as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.</P>
              <P SOURCE="P-1">-If, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then select the highest containment factor value assigned to the sources at the site eligible to be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-1.</P>
              <P>A source meets the minimum size requirement if its source hazardous waste quantity value (see section 2.4.2.1.5) is 0.5 or more. Do not include the minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this surface water migration component, except potential to release by flood as specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.</P>

Select the highest value calculated for those sources that meet the minimum size requirement specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1 and assign it as the value for the potential to release by flood factor for the watershed. However, if, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, select the highest value calculated for the sources at the site eligible to be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the value for this factor.</P>

The exposure concentrations for a sample (that is, surface water, benthic, or sediment sample) consist of the concentrations of those hazardous substances present that are significantly above background levels and attributable at least in part to the site (that is, those hazardous substance concentrations that meet the criteria for an observed release).</P>
              <P>When an intake is subject to actual contamination, evaluate it using Level I concentrations or Level II concentrations. If the actual contamination is based on an observed release by direct observation, use Level II concentrations for that intake. However, if the actual contamination is based on an observed release from samples, determine which level applies for the intake by comparing the exposure concentrations from samples (or comparable samples) to health-based benchmarks as specified in sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use the health-based benchmarks from table 3-10 (section 3.3.1) in determining the level of contamination from samples. For contaminated sediments with no identified source, evaluate the actual contamination using Level II concentrations (see section 4.1.1.2).</P>

              <P>• If none of these drinking water intakes is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, determine the nearest of these drinking water intakes, as measured from the probable point of entry (or from the point where measurement begins for contaminated sediments with no identified source). Assign a dilution weight from table 4-13 to this intake, based on the type of surface water body in which it is located. Multiply this dilution weight by 20, round the product to the nearest integer, and assign it as the factor value.</P>

              <P>• A hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater is present either in an observed release by direct observation to the watershed or in a surface water or sediment sample from the watershed at a level that meets the criteria for an observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release (that is, it is located either at the point of direct observation or at or between the probable point of entry and the most distant sampling point establishing the observed release).</P>
              <P>• The fishery is closed, and a hazardous substance for which the fishery has been closed has been documented in an observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release.</P>

              <P>• A hazardous substance is present in a tissue sample from an essentially sessile, benthic, human food chain organism from the watershed at a level that meets the criteria for an observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is within the boundaries of the observed release.

              <P>• Determine the level of actual contamination from samples (including tissue samples from essentially sessile, benthic organisms) that meet the criteria for actual food chain contamination by comparing the exposure concentrations (see section 4.1.2.3) from these samples (or comparable samples) to the health-based benchmarks from table 4-17, as described in section 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use only the exposure concentrations for those hazardous substances in the sample (or comparable samples) that meet the criteria for actual contamination of the fishery.</P>

Use only those additional tissue samples and only those hazardous substances in the tissue samples that meet all the following criteria:</P>
              <P SOURCE="P-1">-The tissue sample is from a location that is within the boundaries of the actual food chain contamination for the site (that is, either at the point of direct observation or at or between the probable point of entry and the most distant sample point meeting the criteria for actual food chain contamination).</P>

              <P>4.2.2 <E T="03">Drinking water threat.</E> Evaluate the drinking water threat for each watershed based on three factor categories: likelihood of release, waste characteristics, and targets.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.1 <E T="03">Drinking water threat-likelihood of release.</E> Evaluate the likelihood of release factor category for each watershed in terms of an observed release factor or a potential to release factor.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.1.1 <E T="03">Observed release.</E> Establish an observed release to the uppermost aquifer as specified in section 3.1.1. If an observed release can be established for the uppermost aquifer, assign an observed release factor value of 550 to that watershed, enter this value in table 4-25, and proceed to section 4.2.2.1.3. If no observed release can be established, assign an observed release factor value of 0, enter this value in table 4-25, and proceed to section 4.2.2.1.2.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.1.2 <E T="03">Potential to release.</E> Evaluate potential to release only if an observed release cannot be established for the uppermost aquifer. Calculate a potential to release value for the uppermost aquifer as specified in section 3.1.2 and sections 3.1.2.1 through 3.1.2.5. Assign the potential to release value for the uppermost aquifer as the potential to release factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-25.</P>

              <P>4.2.2.2 <E T="03">Drinking water threat-waste characteristics.</E> Evaluate the waste characteristics factor category for each watershed based on two factors: toxicity/mobility/persistence and hazardous waste quantity. Evaluate only those hazardous substances available to migrate from the sources at the site to the uppermost aquifer (see section 3.2). Such hazardous substances include:</P>
              <P>• Hazardous substances that meet the criteria for an observed release to ground water.</P>
              <P>• All hazardous substances associated with a source that has a ground water containment factor value greater than 0 (see sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 3.1.2.1).</P>
              <P>4.2.2.2.1 <E T="03">Toxicity/mobility/persistence.</E> For each hazardous substance, assign a toxicity factor value, a mobility factor value, a persistence factor value, and a combined toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value as specified in sections 4.2.2.2.1.1 through 4.2.2.2.1.4.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.2.1.1 <E T="03">Toxicity.</E> Assign a toxicity factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 2.4.1.1.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.2.1.2 <E T="03">Mobility.</E> Assign a ground water mobility factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 3.2.1.2.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.2.1.3 <E T="03">Persistence.</E> Assign a surface water persistence factor value to each hazardous substance as specified in section 4.1.2.2.1.2.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.2.1.4 <E T="03">Calculation of toxicity/mobility/persistence factor value.</E> First, assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility factor value from table 3-9 (section 3.2.1.3), based on the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and mobility factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/mobility/persistence factor <PRTPAGE P="176"/>value from table 4-26, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/mobility and persistence factors. Use the substance with the highest toxicity/mobility/ persistence factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in table 4-25.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.2.2 <E T="03">Hazardous waste quantity.</E> Assign the same factor value for hazardous waste quantity for the watershed as would be assigned for the uppermost aquifer in section 3.2.2. Enter this value in table 4-25.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.2.3 <E T="03">Calculation of drinking water threat-waste characteristics factor category value.</E> Multiply the toxicity/mobility/persistence and hazardous waste quantity factor values for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1 × 10<SU>8</SU>. Based on this product, assign a value from table 2-7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the drinking water threat-waste characteristics factor category for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4-25.</P>

              <P>For the nearest intake and population factors, determine whether the target surface water intakes are subject to actual or potential contamination as specified in section 4.1.1.2, subject to the restrictions specified in sections 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.1.4.</P>
              <P>When the intake is subject to actual contamination, evaluate it using Level I concentrations or Level II concentrations. Determine which level applies for the intake by comparing the exposure concentrations from a sample (or comparable samples) to health-based benchmarks as specified in section 4.1.2.3, except use only those samples from the surface water in-water segment and only those hazardous substances in such samples that meet the conditions in sections 4.2.1.3 and 4.2.1.4.</P>
              <P>4.2.2.3.1 <E T="03">Nearest intake.</E> Assign a value to the nearest intake factor as specified in section 4.1.2.3.1 with the following modification. For the intake being evaluated, multiply its dilution weight from table 4-13 (section 4.1.2.3.1) by a value selected from table 4-27. Use the resulting product, not the value from table 4-13, as the dilution weight for the intake for the ground water to surface water component. Do not round this product to the nearest integer.</P>

              <P>Select the value from table 4-27 based on the angle Θ, the angle defined by the sources at the site and either the two points at the intersection of the surface water body and the 1-mile distance ring of any two other points of the surface water body within the 1-mile distance ring, whichever results in the largest angle. (See Figure 4-3 for an example of how to determine Θ.) If the surface water body does not extend to the 1-mile ring at one or both ends, define Θ using the surface water endpoint(s) within the 1-mile ring or any two other points of the surface water body within the 1-mile distance ring, whichever results in the largest angle.<PRTPAGE P="177"/>

              <P>5.2.0 <E T="03">General considerations.</E> The subsurface intrusion component evaluates the threats from hazardous substances that have or could intrude into regularly occupied structures from the subsurface. Evaluate the subsurface intrusion component based on the actual or potential intrusion of hazardous substances into all regularly occupied structures that have structure containment values greater than zero and meet the criteria identified in the section below as being either in an area of observed exposure or in an area of subsurface contamination. These structures may or may not have subunits. Subunits are partitioned areas within a structure with separate heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems or distinctly different air exchange rates. Subunits include regularly occupied partitioned tenant spaces such as office suites, apartments, condos, common or shared areas, and portions of residential, commercial or industrial structures with separate heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.</P>
              <P>In evaluating the subsurface intrusion component, consider the following:</P>

              <P>• Area(s) of observed exposure: An area of observed exposure is delineated by regularly occupied structures with documented contamination meeting observed exposure criteria; an area of observed exposure includes regularly occupied structures with samples meeting observed exposure criteria or inferred to be within an area of observed exposure based on samples meeting observed exposure criteria (see section 5.2.1.1.1 <E T="03">Observed exposure</E>). Establish areas of observed exposure as follows:
              </P>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—For regularly occupied structures that have no subunits, consider both the regularly occupied structures containing sampling location(s) meeting observed exposure criteria for the site and the regularly occupied structure(s) in the area lying between such locations to be an area of observed exposure (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> inferred to be in an area of observed exposure), unless available information indicates otherwise.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—In multi-story, multi-subunit, regularly occupied structures, consider all subunits on a level with sampling locations meeting observed exposure criteria from the site and all levels below, if any, to be within an area of observed exposure, unless available information indicates otherwise.</FP>

              <P>• Area(s) of subsurface contamination: An area of subsurface contamination is delineated by sampling locations meeting observed release criteria for subsurface intrusion, excluding areas of observed exposure (see Table 2-3 in section 2.3). The area within an area of subsurface contamination includes potentially exposed populations. If the significant increase in hazardous substance levels cannot be attributed at least in part to the site, and cannot be attributed to other sites, attribution can be established based on the presence of hazardous substances in the area of subsurface contamination.

              <P>6.1.1 <E T="03">Observed release.</E> Establish an observed release to the atmosphere by demonstrating that the site has released a hazardous substance to the atmosphere. Base this demonstration on either:</P>
              <P>• Direct observation—a material (for example, particulate matter) that contains one or more hazardous substances has been seen entering the atmosphere directly. When evidence supports the inference of a release of a material that contains one or more hazardous substances by the site to the atmosphere, demonstrated adverse effects accumulated with that release may be used to establish an observed release.</P>
              <P>• Chemical analysis—an analysis of air samples indicates that the concentration of ambient hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the background concentration for the site (see section 2.3). Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to establish the observed release.</P>
              <P>If an observed release can be established, assign an observed release factor value of 550, enter this value in table 6-1, and proceed to section 6.1.3.

              <P>In general, sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances involve more evaluation than sites containing only radionuclides. For sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, HRS factors are evaluated based on considerations of both the radioactive substances and the other hazardous substances in order to derive a single set of factor values for each factor category in each of the four pathways. Thus, the HRS score for these sites reflects the combined potential hazards posed by both the radioactive and other hazardous substances.</P>
              <P>Section 7 is organized by factor category, similar to sections 3 through 6. Pathway-specific differences in evaluation criteria are specified under each factor category, as appropriate. These differences apply largely to the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway and to sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances. All evaluation criteria specified in sections 2 through 6 must be met, except where modified in section 7.</P>

When an observed release or exposure cannot be established for a migration pathway or the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, evaluate potential to release as specified in section 7.1.2. When observed contamination cannot be established, do not evaluate the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway.</P>
              <P>7.1.1 <E T="03">Observed release/observed contamination/observed exposure.</E> For radioactive substances, establish an observed release for each migration pathway by demonstrating that the site has released a radioactive substance to the pathway (or watershed or aquifer, as appropriate); establish observed contamination or observed exposure for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway as indicated below. Base these demonstrations on one or more of the following, as appropriate to the pathway being evaluated:</P>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—For each migration pathway, a material that contains one or more radionuclides has been seen entering the atmosphere, surface water, or ground water, as appropriate, or is known to have entered ground water or surface water through direct deposition, or</FP>

Also, when evidence supports the inference of subsurface intrusion of a material that contains one or more radionuclides by the site into a regularly occupied structure, demonstrated adverse effects associated with that release may also be used to establish observed exposure by direct observation.</FP>

For each source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination) containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, calculate two source hazardous waste quantity values—one based on radionuclides as specified in sections 7.2.5.1 through 7.2.5.1.3 and the other based on the nonradioactive hazardous substances as specified in sections 2.4.2.1 through 2.4.2.1.5, and sections 5.1.1.2.2, 5.1.2.2.2 and 5.2.1.2.2 (that is, determine each value as if the other type of substance was not present). Sum the two values to determine a combined source hazardous waste quantity value for the source (or area of observed contamination, area of observed exposure, or area of subsurface contamination). Do not round this value to the nearest integer.</P>
              <P>Use this combined source hazardous waste quantity value to calculate the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway as specified in section 2.4.2.2, except: if either the hazardous constituent quantity or the radionuclide constituent quantity, or both, are not adequately determined for one or more sources (or one or more portions of sources or releases remaining after a removal action) or for one or more areas of observed contamination or areas of observed exposure, as applicable, assign the value from Table 2-6 or the default value applicable for the pathway, whichever is greater, as the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the pathway.</P>
              <P>7.3 Targets. For radioactive substances, evaluate the targets factor category as specified in section 2.5 and sections 3 through 6, except: Establish Level I and Level II concentrations at sampling locations as specified in sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 and establish weighting factors for populations associated with an area of subsurface contamination in the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway as specified in section 7.3.3.</P>
              <P>For all pathways (components and threats), use the same target distance limits for sites containing radioactive substances as is specified in sections 3 through 6 for sites containing nonradioactive hazardous substances. At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, include all sources (or areas of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) at the site in identifying the applicable targets for the pathway.</P>
              <P>7.3.1 <E T="03"> Level of contamination at a sampling location.</E> Determine whether Level I or Level II concentrations apply at a sampling location (and thus to the associated targets) as follows:</P>
              <P>• Select the benchmarks from section 7.3.2 applicable to the pathway (or component or threat) being evaluated.</P>
              <P>• Compare the concentrations of radionuclides in the sample (or comparable samples) to their benchmark concentrations for the pathway (or component or threat) as specified in section 7.3.2. Treat comparable samples as specified in section 2.5.1.</P>
              <P>• Determine which level applies based on this comparison.</P>
              <P>• If none of the radionuclides eligible to be evaluated for the sampling location have an applicable benchmark, assign Level II to the actual contamination at that sampling location for the pathway (or component or threat).</P>
              <P>• In making the comparison, consider only those samples, and only those radionuclides in the sample, that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway, except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may also be used for the human food chain threat of the surface water pathway as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3.</P>
              <P>7.3.2 <E T="03"> Comparison to benchmarks.</E> Use the following media specific benchmarks (expressed in activity units, for example,pCi/l <PRTPAGE P="232"/>for water, pCi/kg for soil and for aquatic human food chain organisms, and pCi/m3 for air) for making the comparisons for the indicated pathway (or threat):</P>
              <P>• Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)—ground water migration pathway and drinking water threat in surface water migration pathway.</P>
              <P>• Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) standards—soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway only.</P>

              <P>• Screening concentration for cancer corresponding to that concentration that corresponds to the 10<E T="51">−6</E> individual cancer risk for inhalation exposures (air migration pathway and subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway) or for oral exposures (ground water migration pathway; drinking water or human food chain threats in surface water migration pathway; and soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway).
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—For the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, include two screening concentrations for cancer—one for ingestion of surface materials and one for external radiation exposures from gamma-emitting radionuclides in surface materials.</FP>
              <P>Select the benchmark(s) applicable to the pathway (component or threat) being evaluated. Compare the concentration of each radionuclide from the sampling location to its benchmark concentration(s) for that pathway (component or threat). Use only those samples and only those radionuclides in the sample that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway, except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of any applicable radionuclide from any sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations for that pathway (component or threat). If more than one benchmark applies to the radionuclide, assign Level I if the radionuclide concentration equals or exceeds the lowest applicable benchmark concentration. In addition, for the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, assign Level I concentrations at the sampling location if measured gamma radiation exposure rates equal or exceed 2 times the background level (see section 7.1.1).</P>
              <P>If no radionuclide individually equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, but more than one radionuclide either meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the sample or is eligible to be evaluated for a tissue sample (see sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3), calculate a value for index I for these radionuclides as specified in section 2.5.2. If I equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sampling location. If I is less than 1, assign Level II.</P>
              <P>At sites containing mixed radioactive and other hazardous substances, establish the level of contamination for each sampling location considering radioactive substances and nonradioactive hazardous substances separately. Compare the concentration of each radionuclide and each nonradioactive hazardous substance from the sampling location to its respective benchmark concentration(s). Use only those samples and only those substances in the sample that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the pathway except: Tissue samples from aquatic human food chain organisms may be used as specified in sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.2.3.3. If the concentration of one or more applicable radionuclides or other hazardous substances from any sample equals or exceeds its benchmark concentration, consider the sampling location to be subject to Level I concentrations. If more than one benchmark applies to a radionuclide or other hazardous substance, assign Level I if the concentration of the radionuclide or other hazardous substance equals or exceeds its lowest applicable benchmark concentration.</P>
              <P>If no radionuclide or other hazardous substance individually exceed a benchmark concentration, but more than one radionuclide or other hazardous substance either meets the criteria for an observed release (or observed contamination or observed exposure) for the sample or is eligible to be evaluated for a tissue sample, calculate an index I for both types of substances as specified in section 2.5.2. Sum the index I values for the two types of substances. If the value, individually or combined, equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sample location. If it is less than 1, calculate an index J for the nonradioactive hazardous substances as specified in section 2.5.2. If J equals or exceeds 1, assign Level I to the sampling location. If J is less than 1, assign Level II.</P>

              <P>7.3.3 Weighting of targets within an area of subsurface contamination. For the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, assign a weighting factor as specified in section 5.2.1.3.2.3 except when a structure in an area of subsurface contamination is delineated or inferred to be delineated by gamma radiation exposure rates meeting observed release criteria with a depth to contamination of 2 feet or less. For those populations residing, working, or attending school or day care in a structure delineated or inferred to be delineated by gamma radiation exposure rates meeting observed release criteria with <PRTPAGE P="233"/>a depth to contamination of 2 feet or less, assign a weighting factor of 0.9.</P>

              <P>1.1 <E T="03">Scope and Application.</E> The methods described below apply to “dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents” involving subpart J (Use of Dispersants and Other Chemicals) in 40 CFR part 300 (National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan). They are revisions and additions to the EPA's Standard Dispersant Effectiveness and Toxicity Tests (1). The new Swirling Flask Dispersant Effectiveness Test is used only for testing dispersants. The Revised Standard Dispersant Toxicity Test is used for testing dispersants, as well as surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents. The bioremediation agent effectiveness test is used for testing bioremediation agents only.</P>
              <P>1.2 <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The definitions of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, and miscellaneous oil spill control agents are provided in 40 CFR 300.5.</P>

              <P>2.1 <E T="03">Summary of Method.</E> This protocol was developed by Environment Canada to provide <PRTPAGE P="253"/>a relatively rapid and simple testing procedure for evaluating dispersant effectiveness (2). It uses a modified Erlenmeyer flask to which a side spout has been added for removing subsurface samples of water near the bottom of the flask without disturbing a surface oil layer. Seawater and a surface layer of oil are added to the flask. Turbulent mixing is provided by placing the flask on a standard shaker table at 150 rpm for 20 minutes to induce a swirling motion to the liquid contents. Following shaking, the flask is immediately removed from the shaker table and maintained in a stationary position for 10 minutes to allow the oil that will reform a slick to return to the water's surface. A sample of water for chemical analysis is then removed from the bottom of the flask through the side spout, extracted with methylene chloride (dichloromethane-DCM), and analyzed for oil content by UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry at wavelengths of 340, 370, and 400 nm (2).</P>
              <P>2.2 <E T="03">Apparatus.</E>
              </P>
              <P>2.2.1 Modified Erlenmeyer Flask. Use 125-ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks that have been modified to include an attachment of a glass side spout that extends from the bottom of the flask upward to the neck region, as shown in Figure 1.</P>
              <P>2.2.2 <E T="03">Shaker Table.</E> Use a shaker table with speed control unit with variable speed (40-400 rpm) and an orbital diameter of approximately 0.75 inches (2 cm) to provide turbulence to solutions in test flasks.</P>
              <P>2.2.3 <E T="03">Spectrophotometer.</E> Use a UV-visible spectrophotometer capable of measuring absorbance at 340, 370, and 400 nm. A Hitachi Model U-2000 or equivalent is acceptable for this purpose.</P>
              <P>2.2.4 <E T="03">Glassware.</E> Glassware should consist of 5-, 10-, 25-, 100-, and 500-ml graduated cylinders; 125-ml separatory funnels with Teflon stopcocks; and 10-, 100-, and 1,000-ml volumetric flasks and micropipettes.</P>

For experiments with no dispersant, only oil is used to make the standard solution. For experiments with the oil plus dispersant, the standard is made with a 1:10 (v:v) mixture of the dispersant to the test oil (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a dispersant-to-oil ratio of 1:10). This ratio is used in the test tank with dispersant added. The presence of water and certain dispersants in DCM extracts can affect absorbance readings in a spectrophotometer. All standard solutions of oil (and dispersant, if present) should be prepared in a stepwise manner that reflects the analytical protocol used for the experimental water samples.</P>

              <P>2.4.1.2 To prepare the standards, prepare a parent oil-DCM standard by mixing 1 part oil (plus <FR>1/10</FR> part premixed dispersant, if applicable) to 9 parts DCM (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, 1:10 dilution of the oil v:v). Add a specific volume of the parent oil-DCM standard to 30 ml of synthetic seawater in a separatory funnel. Extract the oil-water mixture with 5-ml volumes of DCM after 15 seconds of vigorous shaking followed by a 2 minute stationary period to allow for phase separation for each extraction. Repeat the extraction using a total of three 5-ml portions of DCM. Adjust the final DCM volume for the combined extracts to 20 ml with DCM in a 25-ml graduated cylinder.</P>
              <P>2.4.1.3 The quantities of oil used to achieve the desired concentrations in the final 20-ml DCM extracts for the standard oil-solutions are summarized in table 3. Specific masses for oil amounts in standards are determined as volumes of oil multiplied by the density of the oil.</P>

              <P>3.1 <E T="03">Summary of method.</E> The standard toxicity test for dispersants and other products involves exposing two species (Menidia beryllina (silversides) and Mysidopsis bahia (mysid shrimp)) to five concentrations of the test product and No. 2 fuel oil alone and in a 1:10 mixture of product to oil. To aid in comparing results from assays performed by different workers, reference toxicity tests are conducted using dodecyl sodium sulfate (DSS) as a reference toxicant. The test length is 96 hours for Menidia and 48 hours for Mysidopsis. LC<E T="52">50</E> s are calculated based on mortality data at the end of the exposure period (for method of calculation, see section 3.6 below).</P>

              </P>
              <P>3.2.1.1 <E T="03">Menidia beryllina.</E> Obtain fish (silversides) from a single source for each series of toxicity tests. In-house cultures are recommended wherever it is cost-effective; however, organisms are available from commercial suppliers. Information on the source of test organisms and any known unusual condition to which fish were exposed before use should be included in the data report. Use of animals previously treated with pesticides or chemotherapeutic agents should be avoided. Organisms should not be used if they appear to be unhealthy, discolored, or show signs of stress. Use 7-day old larval fish. Fish should be cultured in accordance with the methods outlined in Middaugh, et al. (5). There should be no need to acclimate organisms to the 25±1 °C temperature recommended for the toxicity tests if laboratory stock cultures of Menidia are maintained at the recommended culture temperature of 25±1 °C. If test organisms must be obtained from a commercial source, it may become necessary to acclimate test fish to the test temperature of 25±1 °C, a pH of 8.0±0.2, and 20±2 ppt salinity since changes in temperature may occur during shipping. Eliminate groups of fish having a mortality of more than 10% during the first 48 hours, and more than 5% thereafter. During acclimation, organisms should be maintained on a diet of freshly hatched Artemia (brine shrimp) nauplii. Feed the fish daily to satiation during the acclimation period, and once daily during the 96-hour test. Care should be taken daily to remove excess food and fecal material from beakers during the test. Use only those organisms that feed actively and that appear to be healthy. Organisms should be free of disease, external parasites, and any signs of physical damage or stress. Discard any fish injured or dropped while handling.</P>
              <P>3.2.1.2 <E T="03">Mysidopsis bahia.</E> Several methods for culturing Mysidopsis bahia (mysid shrimp) may be used and are noted in appendix A of Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to Freshwater and Marine Organisms (6). To ensure uniformity of mysids, recently hatched mysids should be collected daily from stock cultures and identified by the date of hatch. Mysids used in 48-hour tests should be from a single day's collection, but may have an age range of 5-7 days old. In cases where in-house cultures of mysids are unavailable, organisms may be purchased from a commercial source. Information on the source of test organisms should be submitted in the data report.</P>
              <P>3.2.2 <E T="03">Preparation of experimental water.</E> Filtered natural seawater is recommended for use since it represents a natural source of saltwater containing an inherent population of microorganisms. Synthetic seawater formulated according to the following method can serve as an acceptable alternative to filtered, natural seawater for toxicity tests <PRTPAGE P="258"/>performed in laboratories in which natural seawater is unavailable.</P>
              <P>3.2.3 <E T="03">Synthetic seawater formation.</E> To prepare standard seawater, mix technical-grade salts with 900 liters of distilled or demineralized water in the order and quantities listed in table 4. These ingredients must be added in the order listed and each ingredient must be dissolved before another is added. Stir constantly after each addition during preparation until dissolution is complete. Add distilled or demineralized water to make up to 1,000 liters. The pH should now be 8.0±0.2. To attain the desired salinity of 20±1 ppt, dilute again with distilled or demineralized water at time of use.</P>
              <P>3.3 <E T="03">Sampling and storage of test materials.</E> Toxicity tests are performed with No. 2 fuel oil having the characteristics defined in table 5. Store oil used for toxicity tests in sealed containers to prevent the loss of volatiles and other changes. For ease in handling and use, it is recommended that 1,000-ml glass containers be used. To ensure comparable results in the bioassay tests, use oils packaged and sealed at the source. Dispose of unused oil in each open container on completion of dosing to prevent its use at a later date when it may have lost some of its volatile components. Run all tests in a bioassay series with oil from the same container and with organisms from the same group collected or secured from the same source.</P>

              <P>3.4.1 <E T="03">Temperature.</E> For these toxicity tests, use test solutions with temperatures of 25±1 °C.</P>
              <P>3.4.2 <E T="03">Dissolved oxygen and aeration.</E>
              </P>
              <P>3.4.2.1 <E T="03">Menidia.</E> Because oils contain toxic, volatile materials, and because the toxicity of some water-soluble fractions of oil and degradation products are changed by oxidation, special care must be used in the oxygenation of test solutions. Aeration during the test is generally not recommended but should be used to maintain the required dissolved oxygen (DO) in cases where low DO is observed. The DO content of test solutions must not drop below 60% saturation during the first 48 hours of a static acute (96-hour) test and must remain between 40-100% after the first 48 hours of the test. Aeration at a rate of 100±15 bubbles per minute is supplied by a serological pipette as needed for maintenance of DO. If aeration is necessary, all test chambers should be aerated. At this rate, and with the proper weight of fish, DO concentration should remain slightly above 4 ppm over a 96-hour period. Take DO measurements daily.</P>

              <P>3.4.2.2 <E T="03">Mysidopsis.</E> Achieve sufficient DO by ensuring that the surface area to volume ratio of the test solution exposed is large enough. Oxygen content should remain high throughout the test because of the low oxygen demand of the organisms. Aeration is not recommended during 48-hour acute toxicity tests unless the DO falls below 60% saturation.</P>
              <P>3.4.3 <E T="03">Controls.</E> With each fish or mysid test or each series of simultaneous tests of different solutions, perform a concurrent control test in exactly the same manner as the other tests and under the conditions prescribed or selected for those tests. Use the diluent water alone as the medium in which the controls are held. There must be no more than 10% mortality among the controls during the course of any valid test.</P>
              <P>3.4.4 <E T="03">Reference toxicant.</E> To aid in comparing results from tests performed by different workers and to detect changes in the condition of the test organisms that might lead to different results, perform reference toxicity tests with reagent grade DSS in addition to the usual control tests. Prepare a stock solution of DSS immediately before use by adding 1 gram of DSS per 500 ml of test water solution. Use exploratory tests before the full scale tests are begun to determine the <PRTPAGE P="259"/>amount of reference standard to be used in each of the five different concentrations.</P>
              <P>3.4.5 <E T="03">Number of organisms.</E> At a minimum, 20 organisms of a given species are exposed for each test concentration. For the toxicity test procedures using Menidia, place 10 fish in each of two jars. For the toxicity tests using Mysidopsis, place 10 larvae in each of two containers.</P>
              <P>3.4.6 <E T="03">Transfer of organisms.</E> Organisms should be handled as little as possible in order to minimize stress. Transfer Menidia and Mysidopsis from the acclimatization aquaria to the test chambers with a pipette or a wide-bore, smooth glass tube (4 to 8 mm internal diameter) fitted with a rubber bulb. Dip nets should be avoided when handling larval fish and mysids. Do not hold fish out of the water longer than necessary and discard any specimen accidentally dropped or otherwise mishandled during transfer.</P>
              <P>3.4.6.1 <E T="03">Mysidopsis.</E> To have the mysids ready for study, mysids may be sorted 24 hours prior to initiation of the 48-hour test. Transfer the mysids to a beaker containing a small volume of water; this vessel serves as a holding chamber during randomized transfer of the organisms to test solutions. Mysids are randomly selected from the batch of mysids in the holding chamber, and transferred to 50-ml beakers containing a small volume of seawater. One mysid is added per beaker using a small piece of flexible 500-µm screening until all of the beakers contain one mysid. The process of random selection and sorting is continued until the appropriate number of mysids has been delivered to each of the 50-ml beakers. The mysids are gently released from the 50-ml beakers into larger beakers filled with an appropriate volume of 20-ppt seawater (25 °C) to bring the total volume to 200 ml. The beakers are randomly placed into a temperature-controlled water bath to acclimate overnight at 25 °C. The mysids are transferred to larger beakers (1-liter) for the 48-hour test after the addition of 800 ml of the test solution. A total of 10 mysids per beaker are used for 48-hour acute toxicity tests. A minimum of two replicate chambers are used for each test concentration and control.</P>
              <P>3.4.6.2 <E T="03">Menidia and Mysidopsis</E> are fed 50 brine shrimp nauplii/organism daily during the 96-hour and 48-hour tests. Excess food should be removed daily by aspirating with a pipette.</P>
              <P>3.4.7 <E T="03">Test duration and observations.</E> 3.4.7.1 <E T="03">Menidia.</E> Observe the number of dead fish in each test container and record at the end of each 24-hour period. Fish are considered dead upon cessation of respiratory and all other overt movements, whether spontaneous or in response to mild mechanical prodding. Remove dead fish as soon as observed. Also note and report when the behavior of test fish deviates from that of control fish. Such behavioral changes would include variations in opercular movement, coloration, body orientation, movement, depth in container, schooling tendencies, and others. Abnormal behavior of the test organisms (especially during the first 24 hours) is a desirable parameter to monitor in a toxicity test because changes in behavior and appearance may precede mortality. Toxicants can reduce an organism's ability to survive natural stresses. In these cases, the mortality is not directly attributed to the toxicant, but most certainly is an indirect effect. Reports on behavioral changes during a toxicity test can give insight into the non-acute effects of the tested material. At the end of the 96-hour period, terminate the fish tests and determine the LC<E T="52">50</E> values. The acute toxicity test is terminated after four days of exposure. The number of surviving fish are counted and recorded for each chamber in accordance with standard EPA methods (6). The LC<E T="52">50</E> is calculated using survival data from the test in accordance with the methods described in the guidelines (6).</P>
              <P>3.4.7.2 <E T="03">Mysidopsis.</E> Terminate the mysid test after 48 hours of incubation. To count the dead animals accurately, place the exposure vessels on a light table such that light passes through the bottom of the vessel. Most of the dead mysids will be on the bottom of the beaker and can readily be seen against the background of the light table. Also search the top of the liquid for mysids trapped there by surface tension. Exercise caution when determining death of the animals. Occasionally, an animal appears dead, but closer observation shows slight movement of an appendage or a periodic spasm of its entire body. For these tests, animals exhibiting any movement when touched with a pipette tip are considered alive. Account for all test animals to ensure accuracy since <E T="03">Mysidopsis bahia</E> may disintegrate or be cannibalized by other mysids. Consider individuals not accounted for as dead. At the end of 48 hours of exposure, terminate the mysid assay and determine the LC<E T="52">50</E> values in accordance with the methods described in the guidelines (6).</P>
              <P>3.4.8 <E T="03">Physical and chemical determinations.</E> 3.4.8.1 <E T="03">Menidia.</E> Determine the temperature, DO, and pH of the test solutions before the fish are added and at 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-hour exposure intervals. It is necessary to take measurements from only one of the replicates of each of the toxicant series.</P>
              <P>3.4.8.2 <E T="03">Mysidopsis.</E> Determine the temperature, DO, and pH of the test solutions before the nauplii are added and at the 24- and 48-hour exposure interval. Measure DO and pH in only one of the replicates of each of the toxicant series.</P>
              <P>3.4.9 <E T="03">Testing laboratory.</E> An ordinary heated or air-conditioned laboratory room with thermostatic controls suitable for maintaining the prescribed test temperatures generally will suffice to conduct the toxicity <PRTPAGE P="260"/>tests. Where ambient temperatures cannot be controlled to 25±1 °C, use water baths with the necessary temperature controls.</P>
              <P>3.4.10 <E T="03">Test containers.</E> For tests with fish or mysids, use 1-liter glass beakers measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter. In conducting the test, add to each beaker 1 liter of the test solution or seawater formulation aerated to saturation with DO. To add the liter volume easily and accurately, use a large volume (1-liter) graduated cylinder. Process all required glassware before each test. Immerse in normal hexane for 10 minutes. Follow this with a thorough rinse with hot tap water; three hot detergent scrubs; an additional hot tap-water rinse; and three rinses with distilled water. Oven or air dry the glassware in a reasonably dust-free atmosphere.</P>
              <P>3.5 <E T="03">Preparation of test concentrations.</E> 3.5.1 <E T="03">Menidia.</E> Place test jars (approximately 22.5 cm in height, 15 cm in diameter, 11 cm in diameter at the mouth) containing 2 liters of synthetic seawater on a reciprocal shaker. The shaker platform should be adapted to hold firmly six of the toxicity test jars. Add the desired amount of the petroleum product (if applicable) under test directly to each test jar. Dispense the appropriate amount of toxicant (if applicable) into the jars with a pipette. Tightly cap the test jars and shake for 5 minutes at approximately 315 to 333 2-cm (0.75-inch) strokes per minute in a reciprocal shaker or at approximately 150 to 160 rpm on orbital shakers. At the completion of shaking, remove the jars from the shaker and dispense 1 liter of the mixture to each of the 1-liter glass beakers. Randomly place beakers in a constant-temperature water bath or room, take water quality measurements, add fish, and initiate aeration.</P>
              <P>3.5.2 <E T="03">Mysidopsis.</E> 3.5.2.1 To prepare test solutions for products and oil/product mixtures, blend or mix the test solutions with an electric blender having: speeds of 10,000 rpm or less; a stainless-steel cutting assembly; and a 1-liter borosilicate jar. To minimize foaming, blend at speeds below 10,000 rpm.</P>
              <P>3.5.2.2 For the product test solution, add 550 ml of the synthetic seawater to the jar, then with the use of a gas-tight calibrated glass syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the product and mix for 5 seconds.</P>
              <P>3.5.2.3 For the oil test solution, add 550 ml of the synthetic seawater to the jar. Then with the use of a gas-tight calibrated glass syringe equipped with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the oil and mix for 5 seconds.</P>
              <P>3.5.2.4 For the oil/product mixture, add 550 ml of the synthetic seawater to the mixing jar. While the blender is in operation, add 0.5 ml of the oil under study with the use of a calibrated syringe with a Teflon-tipper plunger and then 0.05 ml of the product as indicated above. Blend for 5 seconds after addition of product. These additions provide test solutions of the product, oil, and the oil/product mixture at concentrations of 1,000 ppm.</P>
              <P>3.5.2.5 Immediately after the test solutions are prepared, draw up the necessary amount of test solution with a gas-tight Teflon-tipped glass syringe of appropriate size and dispense into each of the five containers in each series. If the series of five concentrations to be tested are 10, 18, 32, 56, and 100 ppm, the amount of the test solution in the order of the concentrations listed above would be as follows: 10, 18, 32, 56, and 100 ml.</P>
              <P>3.5.2.6 Each time a syringe is to be filled for dispensing to the series of test containers, start the mixer and withdraw the desired amount in the appropriate syringe while the mixer is in operation. Turn off immediately after the sample is taken to limit the loss of volatiles.</P>
              <P>3.5.2.7 Use exploratory tests before the full-scale test is set up to determine the concentration of toxicant to be used in each of the five different concentrations. After adding the required amounts of liquid, bring the volume in each of the test containers up to 800 ml with the artificial seawater. To ensure keeping each of the series separate, designate on the lid of each container the date, the material under test, and its concentration.</P>

              <P>3.5.2.8 When the desired concentrations are prepared, gently release into each beaker the 10 test <E T="03">Mysidopsis</E> (previously transferred into 200 ml of medium). This provides a volume of 1 liter in each test chamber. A pair of standard cover glass forceps with flat, bent ends is an ideal tool for handling and tipping the small beaker without risk of contaminating the medium.</P>
              <P>3.5.2.9 After adding the test animals, incubate the test beakers at 25±1 °C for 48 hours. Recommended lighting is 2,000 lumens/m<SU>2</SU> (200 ft-c) of diffused, constant, fluorescent illumination.</P>
              <P>3.5.2.10 Wash the blender thoroughly after use and repeat the above procedures for each series of tests. Wash the blender as follows: rinse with normal hexane; pour a strong solution of laboratory detergent into the blender to cover the blades; fill the container to about half of its volume with hot tap water; operate the blender for about 30 seconds at high speed; remove and rinse twice with hot tap water, mixing each rinse for 5 seconds at high speed; and then rinse twice with distilled water, mixing each rinse for 5 seconds at high speed.</P>
              <P>3.6 <E T="03">Calculating and reporting.</E> At the end of the test period, the toxicity tests are terminated and the LC<E T="52">50</E> values are determined.<PRTPAGE P="261"/>
              </P>
              <P>3.6.1 <E T="03">Calculations.</E> The LC<E T="52">50</E> is the concentration lethal to 50% of the test population. It can be calculated as an interpolated value based on percentages of organisms surviving at two or more concentrations, at which less than half and more than half survived. The LC<E T="52">50</E> can be estimated with the aid of computer programs or graphic techniques (log paper). The 95% confidence intervals for the LC<E T="52">50</E> estimate should also be determined.</P>
              <P>3.6.2 <E T="03">Reporting.</E> The test product and oil and their source and storage are described in the toxicity test report. Note any observed changes in the experimental water or the test solutions. Also include the species of fish used; the sources, size, and condition of the fish; data of any known treatment of the fish for disease or infestation with parasites before their use; and any observations on the fish behavior at regular intervals during the tests. In addition to the calculated LC<E T="52">50</E> values, other data necessary for interpretation (e.g., DO, pH, other physical parameters, and the percent survival at the end of each day of exposure at each concentration of toxicant) should be reported.</P>
              <P>3.7 <E T="03">Summary of procedures.</E> 3.7.1 <E T="03">Menidia:</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. Prepare adequate stocks of the appropriate standard dilution water.</P>
              <P>2. Add 2 liters of the standard dilution water to the test jars. Each test consists of 5 replicates of each of 5 concentrations of the test material, a control series of 5 beakers, and a standard reference series of 5 different concentrations for a total of 35 beakers. Simultaneous performance of toxicity tests on the oil, product, and oil/product mixture requires a total of 105 beakers.</P>
              <P>3. Add the determined amount (quarter points on the log scale) of test material to the appropriate jars. Preliminary tests will be necessary to define the range of definitive test concentrations.</P>
              <P>4. Cap the jars tightly with the Teflon-lined screw caps and shake for 5 minutes at 315 to 333 2-cm (0.75-inch) strokes per minute on a reciprocal shaker.</P>
              <P>5. Remove the jars from the shaker, take water quality data, dispense 1 liter of solution to the 1-liter glass beaker, and add 10 acclimated fish per beaker.</P>
              <P>6. Aerate with 100±15 bubbles per minute through a 1-ml serological pipette, as needed, to maintain DO above 4.0 mg/l.</P>
              <P>7. Observe and record mortalities, water quality, and behavioral changes every 24 hours.</P>

              <P>8. After 96 hours, terminate the test, and calculate LC<E T="52">50</E> values and corresponding confidence limits.</P>
              <P>3.7.2 <E T="03">Mysidopsis:</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. Initiate the procedure for hatching the Mysidopsis in sufficient time before the toxicity test is to be conducted so that 5-7 day old larvae are available.</P>
              <P>2. With the use of a small pipette, transfer 10 Mysidopsis into small beakers, each containing 200 ml of the proper synthetic seawater.</P>
              <P>3. To prepare the test stock product and oil solutions, add 550 ml of the artificial seawater to the prescribed blender jar. By means of a gas-tight glass syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger, add 0.55 ml of the product (or oil) and mix at 10,000 rpm for 5 seconds. To prepare the test stock oil/product mixture, add 550 ml of the standard seawater to the blender jar. While the blender is in operation (10,000 rpm), add 0.5 ml of the oil, then 0.05 ml of the product with the use of a calibrated syringe with a Teflon-tipped plunger. Blend for 5 seconds after adding the product. One ml of these stock solutions added to the 100 ml of standard seawater in the test containers yields a concentration of 10 ppm product, oil, or oil/product combination (the test will be in a ratio of 1 part product to 10 parts of oil).</P>
              <P>4. Each test consists of 5 replications of each of 5 concentrations of the material under study, a control series of 5 beakers and a standard reference series of 5 different concentrations, for a total of 35 beakers. Simultaneous performance of toxicity tests on the oil, product, and oil/product mixture requires a total of 105 beakers. Immediately after preparing the test solution of the product or oil/product solution, and using an appropriately sized syringe, draw up the necessary amount of test solution and dispense into each of the five containers in each series. Each time a syringe is to be filled for dispensing to the series of test containers, start the mixer and withdraw the desired amount in the appropriate syringe while the mixer is in operation. Turn mixer off immediately after the sample is taken to limit the loss of volatiles. After adding the required amount of the test oil/product or product mixture, bring the volume of liquid in each of the test containers up to 800 ml with the artificial seawater. When the desired concentrations have been prepared, gently release into each beaker the 10 mysids previously transferred into 200 ml of medium. This provides a volume of 1 liter in each test chamber.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Bioremediation agent effectiveness test</HD>
              <P>4.1 <E T="03">Summary of method.</E> The bioremediation agent effectiveness testing protocol is designed to determine a product's ability to biodegrade oil by quantifying changes in the <PRTPAGE P="262"/>oil composition resulting from biodegradation. The protocol tests for microbial activity and quantifies the disappearance of saturated hydrocarbons and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The sample preparation procedure extracts the oil phase into dichloromethane (DCM), with a subsequent solvent exchange into hexane. To effectively accomplish the goals of the testing protocol, it is necessary to normalize the concentration of the various analytes in oil to a non-biodegradable marker, either C<E T="52">2</E>-or C<E T="52">3</E>-phenanthrene, C<E T="52">2</E>-chrysene, or hopane <SU>1</SU>

                <FTREF/> (7). The test method targets the relatively easy to degrade normal alkanes and the more resistant and toxic PAHs. It normalizes their concentrations to C<E T="52">2</E>-or C<E T="52">3</E>-phenanthrene, C<E T="52">2</E>-chrysene, or C<E T="52">30</E>17α(H), 21β (H)-hopane on an oil weight basis (mg marker/kg oil, mg target analyte/kg oil). The analytical technique uses a high resolution gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) because of its high degree of chemical separation and spectral resolution. GC/MS has long been used to study the weathering and fate of oil spilled into the environment. For quantitative analyses, the instrument is operated in the selective ion detection (SIM) mode at a scan rate of greater than 1.5 scans per second to maximize the linear quantitative range and precision of the instrument. The sample preparation method does not exclude analysis of selected samples by GC/MS in the full scanning mode of operation to qualitatively assess changes in the oil not accounted for by the SIM approach. Performed concurrently with the chemical analysis described above is a microbiological analysis. The microbiological analysis is performed to determine and monitor the viability of the microbial cultures being studied. Under this procedure, microbial enumerations of hydrocarbon degraders are performed at each sampling event using a microtiter Most Probable Number (MPN) determination.</P>

              <P>1. Borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer flasks (250-ml) are thoroughly cleaned and autoclaved for 20 minutes at 120 °C at 15 psi, then dried in the drying oven.</P>
              <P>2. Flasks are labeled with the appropriate code: product or control, sample day, and letter indicating replicate.</P>
              <P>3. 100 ml of seawater is added to each flask.</P>
              <P>4. For nutrient and product treatments that require the addition of nutrients, seawater containing the nutrient solution is prepared.</P>
              <P>5. Pasteur pipettes should be sterilized in advance. Break off the tip to provide a larger opening prior to sterilization.</P>
              <P>6. Pour the approximate amount of oil to be used from the large stock bottle into a sterile beaker. Keep the beaker covered when oil is not being removed.</P>
              <P>7. The labeled flasks containing seawater and other additions, as necessary, are placed on the balance. The flask is tared. The appropriate amount of oil (0.5 g) is added drop by drop using a sterile Pasteur pipette with the tip broken off to provide a wider opening. Care is taken to avoid splashing the oil or getting it on the sides of flasks. Precautions are taken when handling and charging the flasks to minimize the likelihood of contamination by exogenous microbes. This includes using a new sterile pipette for each series of flasks.</P>
              <P>8. The weight of the oil is recorded in the laboratory notebook.</P>
              <P>9. The product is prepared and added to the appropriate flasks according to the manufacturer's or vendor's instructions.</P>
              <P>10. Flasks are carried upright and carefully placed in the holders on the shaker table to minimize the amount of oil that might adhere to the side of the flasks. Flasks in which a significant amount of oil is splashed on the sides are redone.</P>
              <P>11. The prepared flasks are shaken at 200 rpm at 20 °C until such time that they will be removed for sampling.</P>
              <P>4.4.2 <E T="03">Sampling.</E> The control and treatments (nutrient and product flasks) are sampled three times over a 28-day period: day 0, day 7, and day 28. The entire flask is sacrificed for analysis; a 0.5-ml aliquot is removed from each flask for the microbiological analysis and the remainder of each flask is used for the chemical analysis. Specific procedures for both the microbiological and chemical analysis are described below. At the time of each sampling event, physical observations of each flask should be recorded.<PRTPAGE P="264"/>

              <P>4.6.1 <E T="03">Sample procedure.</E> After 0, 7, and 28 days of incubation on a rotary shaker, the appropriate flasks are sacrificed and extracted with dichloromethane and spiked with a surrogate recovery standard. A 10-ml aliquot of the DCM layer is used for the gravimetric analysis. If significant biodegradation is evident in the results of the gravimetric analysis, then a solvent exchange into hexane takes place prior to the GC/MS analysis. Follow steps 1-19 below when preparing for the chemical analysis.</P>
              <P>1. After 0, 7, and 28 days of rotary shaking and incubating at 20 °C, the reaction vessels are sacrificed. Prior to the chemical analysis, a 0.5-ml sample of the aqueous phase is removed for the microbiological analysis (see Microbial Enumeration above).</P>

              <P>2. A surrogate recovery standard is prepared in the following manner: 1,000 mg of d<E T="52">10</E>-phenanthrene and 1,000 mg of 5α-androstane are measured into a 500-ml volumetric flask and DCM is added to the mark to produce a 2,000-ng/µl stock solution.</P>

              <P>3. A 100-µl aliquot of the surrogate solution is added to each test flask. The final concentration of surrogates in each flask is approximately 4 ng/µl of solvent in the final extract. The aliphatics and marker data should be corrected for percent recovery of the 5α-androstane surrogate and the aromatics for the d<E T="52">10</E>-phenanthrene surrogate.</P>
              <P>4. The contents of the flask are placed into a 250-ml separatory funnel.</P>
              <P>5. Measure a total volume of 50 ml DCM for use in the extraction. Use 3 10-ml fractions to rinse the flask into the funnel and transfer the remaining aliquot of DCM to the funnel.</P>
              <P>6. Stopper and mix vigorously by shaking (approximately 50 times) while ventilating properly.</P>
              <P>7. Each funnel is set aside to allow the DCM and water layers to partition. This may take 5-10 minutes for some products, or up to 3 hours if the product has caused the formation of an emulsion.</P>
              <P>8. Drain the first 10 ml of the DCM (bottom) layer, collect, cap, uniquely label, and use for gravimetric analysis (see below). Drain the remaining 40 ml and dry it by passing it through a funnel packed with anhydrous sodium sulfate.</P>
              <P>9. Assemble a Kuderna-Danish (KD) concentrator by attaching a Snyder column to an evaporation flask with a graduated concentrator tube. Align vertically and partially immerse concentrator tube in a water bath (10). Set the water bath to the appropriate temperature to maintain proper distillation.</P>
              <P>10. Collect the de-watered extract into the KD concentrator.</P>
              <P>11. Evaporate DCM to approximately 10 ml, then add approximately 50 ml of the exchange solvent (hexane) and concentrate the volume to 10 ml.</P>
              <P>12. Rinse the flask into the concentrator tube with 50 ml hexane and concentrate to 10 ml. Repeat one more time with 50 ml of hexane.</P>
              <P>13. Remove concentrator tube with the recovered 10 ml of sample volume. The heavier residual material should be present as a precipitate (bottom layer).</P>
              <P>14. Centrifuge to aid the separation of the hexane from the precipitant fraction.</P>
              <P>15. Place hexane-soluble fraction (top layer)—approximately 1.0 ml—into a GC/MS vial for analysis (see GC/MS Analysis Procedure below). If column fouling and deterioration of separation characteristics occur, an alumina column sample cleanup method can be considered (see Alternative GC/MS Sample Cleanup Procedure below).</P>
              <P>16. Analyze by GC/MS using the conditions determined by the U.S. EPA Risk Reduction Engineering Laboratory, Water and Hazardous Waste Treatment Research Division, in Cincinnati, OH, which follows U.S. EPA Method 8270 (see GC/MS Analysis Procedure below).</P>

              <P>17. Calculate surrogate recovery. If surrogate recovery is less than 85 percent for the marker relative to the surrogate recovery standard (d<E T="52">10</E>-phenanthrene), then the water layer should be extracted again using three separate extractions with DCM. Pool the three extractions with original extract and concentrate to 10 ml, and reanalyze by GC/MS.</P>
              <P>18. Drain the seawater into a storage sample vial/container.</P>
              <P>19. Seal the vial with a Teflon-lined cap and store frozen. This water layer is kept in case additional extractions are necessary.</P>
              <P>4.6.2 <E T="03">Gravimetric analysis.</E> The initial means to evaluate the effectiveness of a bioremediation agent for oil spill response is through gravimetric analysis. A statistically significant difference (p &lt;0.05) in analytical weight <PRTPAGE P="266"/>of the oil from the control system as compared to the analytical weight of the oil treated with a bioremediation agent indicates biodegradation has successfully occurred. Hence, the disappearance of oil should be accompanied by significant decreases in total oil residue weight of extractable materials versus a control. If no significant decrease in oil residue weight is observed, the need to perform further chemical analysis should be evaluated. Follow steps 1-3 to conduct the gravimetric analysis.</P>
              <P>1. The 10 ml of DCM extract (from Sample Procedure step 8 above) is placed in a small vial and concentrated to dryness by nitrogen blowdown techniques using a steady stream of nitrogen (pre-purified gas). If the oil is severely biodegraded, a larger volume of DCM (&gt;10 ml) may be necessary for the gravimetric analysis.</P>
              <P>2. The residue is weighed 3 times for the gravimetric weight of oil. Record the weight of the oil.</P>
              <P>3. Compare statistically (p &lt;0.05) the weight of the product treatment versus the weight of the control from each respective time period. If a significant decrease is observed in the sampling (flask containing bioremediation agent) weight, then proceed with the remainder of the sample procedure.</P>
              <P>4.6.3 <E T="03">GC/MS analysis.</E> Often, analysis of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons by capillary gas chromatography of DCM extracts leads to column fouling and deterioration of separation characteristics. An alternative, simple “one-step” alumina sample cleanup procedure can be performed on oil before injection; this cleanup removes both asphaltenes and polar compounds and can be applied to DCM extracts as well. This procedure is described in steps 1-11 below.</P>

              <P>Immediately prior to injection, an internal standard solution of four deuterated compounds is spiked into the sample extracts and injected. Samples are quantified using the internal standard technique (10) for both the aliphatic and aromatic fractions of the oil extracts in order to provide sufficient information that the oil is being degraded. To help ensure that the observed decline in target analytes is caused by biodegradation rather than by physical loss from mishandling or inefficient extraction, it is necessary to normalize the concentrations of the target analytes via a “conserved internal marker.” Conserved internal markers that have been found useful for quantification are C<E T="52">2</E>- or C<E T="52">3</E>-phenanthrene, C<E T="52">2</E>-chrysene, and C<E T="52">30</E>17α(H),21β(H)-hopane. Deuterated internal standards are used to calculate the relative response factor (RRF) for the target analyte(s). To compute the “normalized concentrations,” the target analyte concentration at a given sampling time is simply divided by the selected conserved analyte concentration at the same sampling time (11). Conduct the GC/MS analysis using the following procedure.</P>
              <P>1. One (1) ml of the hexane extract (from Sample Procedure step 15 above) is placed into a 1.5-ml vial for use on the autosampler of the GC/MS instrument.</P>

              <P>2. To this solution, 20 µl of a 500-ng/µl solution of the internal standards is added and the vial is capped for injection. The final concentration of the internal standards in each sample is 10 ng/µl. This solution contains 4 deuterated compounds: d<E T="52">8</E>-naphthalene, d<E T="52">10</E>-anthracene, d<E T="52">12</E>-chrysene, and d<E T="52">12</E>-perylene.</P>

              <P>3. At the start of any analysis period, the mass spectrometer (MS) is tuned to PFTBA by an autotune program, such as the Hewlett-Packard quicktune routine, to reduce operator variability. Set the GC/MS in the SIM mode at a scan rate of 1.5 scans/second to maximize the linear quantitative range <PRTPAGE P="267"/>and precision of the instrument. Set all other conditions to those specified in Instrument Configuration and Calibration section below.</P>
              <P>4. An instrument blank and a daily standard are analyzed prior to analysis of unknowns. Internal standards are combined with the sample extracts and coinjected with each analysis to monitor the instrument's performance during each run.</P>
              <P>5. Information that should be included on the acquisition form include operator's name and signature, date of extraction, date and time of autotune, date of injection(s), instrument blank, daily standard mix injection, GC column number, and standards for the 5-point calibration curve.</P>
              <P>6. If the instrument is operated for a period of time greater than 12 hours, the tune will be checked and another daily standard analyzed prior to continuing with analyses.</P>

              <P>7. The MS is calibrated using a modified version of EPA Method 8270 (10). Specifically, the concentrations of internal standards are 10 ng/µl instead of 40 ng/µl. A five-point calibration curve is obtained for each compound listed in table 6 prior to sample analysis at 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 ng/µl. A 5-point calibration must be conducted on a standard mix of compounds to determine RRFs for the analytes. The standard mix (excluding the marker) for this calibration curve may be obtained from Absolute Standards, Inc., 498 Russell St., New Haven, CT, 06513, (800) 368-1131.

              <P>12. Compute the “normalized concentrations” for each target analyte concentration at a given sampling time (equation 7) by simply dividing by the conserved internal marker concentration at the same sampling time.</P>
              <P>4.6.4 <E T="03">Generally accepted laboratory procedures.</E> Samples are immediately logged into the laboratory, where they will be given a unique sample identification based on Julian data and the number logged in. Prior to the analysis of any experimental samples, a five-point standard curve is prepared. One of the mid-range standard curve concentration levels is analyzed daily before sample analysis as a continuing standard. RRFs for all target analytes <E T="03">should</E> be within 25% of the standard curve response values at day 0, and at any sampling event the check standard percent difference from the initial five-point calibration must not exceed 20% between the <PRTPAGE P="269"/>before and after daily standard mix (see below). The collected GC/MS data are initially processed by a macro routine, which performs extracted chromatographic plots of the target compounds, integrates the target compounds, and shows integration results to include tabular numbers. The integration values are then transferred to a spreadsheet format to be quantified. Because of the complexity of the analyte matrix (oil), a very high degree of manual verification and reintegration of the spectral data is required.</P>
              <P>4.6.5 <E T="03">QA/QC procedures.</E> The reliability of this method is dependent on the QA/QC procedures followed. Before and after each analytical batch (approximately 10 samples), analyze one procedural blank, one duplicate, and one calibration verification standard (10 ng/µl). Analyze one reference crude oil standard. The instrument's performance and reproducibility are validated routinely in this manner. Surrogate recoveries should be within 70 to 120%, and duplicate relative percent difference values should be ±20%. A control chart of the standard oil should be prepared and monitored. Variations of analytes in the control chart should be no more than 25% from the historical averages. Injection port discrimination for n-C25 and greater alkanes must be carefully monitored; the ratio of RRF n-C32/RRF n-C21 alkanes should not be allowed to fall below 80%. The mass discrimination can be reduced by replacing the quartz liner in the injection port after every analytical batch. The instrument's performance and reproducibility are validated routinely by analyzing the reference crude oil standard. All analyses are recorded in instrument logs detailing operating conditions, date and time, file name, etc. After analysis, the sample extracts are archived at refrigeration temperatures. To document QA/QC, the following information is contained in the detailed quantitative reports: average RRF derived from the standard curve; RRF from the daily standard; percent relative standard deviation; area of target analyte; concentration determined both on a weight and volume basis; and values for any surrogates and internal standards.</P>
              <P>4.6.6 <E T="03">Instrument configuration and calibration.</E> A 2-ml aliquot of the hexane extract prepared by the above procedure is injected into a GC/MS instrument, such as the Hewlett-Packard 5890/5971 GC/MS (recommended for use). This instrument should be equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25-mm I.D., and 0.25-µm film thickness) and a split/splitless injection port operating in the splitless mode. Table 9 summarizes the temperature program used for the analysis. This temperature program has been optimized to give the best separation and sensitivity for analysis of the desired compounds on the instrument. Prior to the sample analysis, a five-point calibration must be conducted on a standard mix of the compounds listed in table 7 to determine RRFs for the analyses.</P>

              <P>4.7 <E T="03">Statistical analysis.</E> The determination of a bioremediation agent's effectiveness will be partially based upon the results of a statistical analysis of the shaker flask experiment. The experimental design for this test is a two factorial design. This two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine data trends. The statistical method is designed to test various types of bioremediation treatments including microbial, nutrient, enzyme, and combination products. The following is a summary of the statistical methods to be used to evaluate the analytical data obtained from all product tests. The experimental design, data analysis methodology, interpretation of results, required documentation, and a numeric example are outlined below.</P>
              <P>4.7.1 <E T="03">Experimental design.</E> The experimental design for this test is known as a factorial experiment with two factors. The first factor is product/control group; the second factor is time (measured in days). For example, if two groups (product A and a non-nutrient control) are tested at each of three points in time (day 0, 7, and 28), the experiment is called a 2 × 3 factorial experiment. There will be three replications (replicated shaker flasks) of each group-time combination.</P>
              <P>4.7.2 <E T="03">Data analysis methods.</E> For each analyte and each product used, a product is considered a success by the demonstration of a statistically significant difference between the mean analyte degradation by the product and the mean analyte degradation by the non-nutrient control. Such a determination will be made by performing an ANOVA on the sample data. The technical aspects of this procedure are outlined in Snedecor and Cochran (12). Most statistical software packages support the use of two-way ANOVA. However, the format required for the input data differs among the various commercial packages. Whichever package is used, the following ANOVA table will be provided as part of the output. In the Degree of Freedom <PRTPAGE P="270"/>column of table 10, p = the number of product/control groups, t = the number of days at which each group is analyzed, and n = the number of replications. For the example of the 2 × 3 factorial experiment discussed above, p = 2, t = 3, and n = 3. The significance of the F-statistics (as indicated by their corresponding p-values) are used to interpret the analysis.</P>

              <P>4.7.3 <E T="03">Interpretation.</E> 4.7.3.1 If the F-statistic for the interaction is significant at the 0.05 level (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, p-value is less than 0.05), the data indicate that the mean response of at least two groups being tested differ for at least one point in time. In order to find out which groups and at which points in time the difference occurs, pairwise comparisons between the group means should be conducted for all time points. These comparisons can be made using protected least squared difference (LSD) or Dunnett mean separation techniques. The protected LSD procedure is detailed in Snedecor and Cochran (12); the Dunnett procedure is outlined in Montgomery (13). For both methods, the mean square error (MSE) from the two-way ANOVA table should be used to compute the separation values.</P>

              <P>4.7.3.2 If the F-statistic for the interaction is not significant at the 0.05 level (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, p-value not less than 0.05), but the F-statistic for the group is significant (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, p-value is less than 0.05), the data indicate that any differences that exist among the group means are consistent across time. To find out which group means differ, a pairwise comparison of the group means should be carried out by pooling data across all points in time. Again, the MSE from the two-way ANOVA table should be used to compute the separation values.</P>
              <P>4.7.3.3 If the F-statistic corresponding to both interaction and group are not significant at the 0.05 level, the data indicate no difference between the group means at any point in time. In this case, no further analysis is necessary.</P>
              <P>4.7.3.4 Finally, Snedecor and Cochran (12) use caution concerning the use of multiple comparisons. If many such comparisons are being conducted, then about 5% of the tested differences will erroneously be concluded as significant. The researcher must guard against such differences causing undue attention.</P>
              <P>4.7.4 <E T="03">Required documentation.</E> 4.7.4.1 The following documents should be included to summarize the findings from a product test.</P>
              <P>1. Data listings for each analyte that was analyzed. These should show all raw data.</P>
              <P>2. A table of summary statistics for each analyte. The table should include the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for each group at each day.</P>
              <P>3. An ANOVA table for each analyte. The table should be of the same format as table 10.</P>
              <P>4. A clear summary of the mean separations (if mean separations were necessary). The mean separation methods (LSD or Dunnett), the significance level, the minimum significant difference value, and the significant differences should be clearly marked on each output page.</P>

In the next three columns, the concentration of the analytes (ng/mg oil), the concentration of the analytes corrected for the recovery of the surrogate standard (α-androstane for alkanes, d<E T="52">10</E>-phenanthrene for aromatics), and the concentration of corrected analytes normalized against the conserved internal marker, respectively, are reported for the first replicate from the first sampling event. These three columns are each repeated for the next two replicates, giving 9 total columns for the product of interest. The next 9 columns are the same as the product columns except they are for the non-nutrient control. The last nine columns are for the nutrient control. Thus, a total of 28 columns are needed in the spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is for the first sampling event (day 0). Two more identical spreadsheets will be needed for each of the next two sampling events (days 7 and 28). For the statistical analysis, a report showing the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) table created by the software used by the investigator must be shown in its entirety along with the name of the software package used. Another printout showing the mean separation table (protected LSD test results) generated by the software must be reported. The statistical analyses are conducted using the sum of the alkane concentrations and the sum of the aromatics concentrations from the raw data table. Thus, two ANOVAs are run for each sampling event, one for total alkanes and one for total aromatics, giving a total of 6 ANOVAs for a product test (2 ANOVAs × 3 sampling events). Only if significant differences are detected by a given ANOVA will it be necessary to run a protected LSD test.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">1.1 Background.</E> The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (CWA), to require the revision of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP). In revising the NCP, the need to separate the response requirements for oil discharges and release of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants became evident.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">1.2 Purpose/objective.</E> This document compiles general oil discharge response requirements into one appendix to aid participants and responders under the national response system (NRS). This appendix provides the organizational structure and procedures to prepare for and respond to oil discharges. Nothing in this appendix alters the meaning or policy stated in other sections or subparts of the NCP.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.3 Scope.</HD>
              <P>(a) This appendix applies to discharges of oil into or upon the navigable waters of the United States and adjoining shorelines, the waters of the contiguous zone, or waters of the exclusive economic zone, or which may affect the natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management authority of the United States.</P>
              <P>(b) This appendix is designed to facilitate efficient, coordinated, and effective response to discharges of oil in accordance with the authorities of the CWA. It addresses:</P>

              <P>(1) The national response organization that may be activated in response actions, the responsibilities among the federal, state, and <PRTPAGE P="277"/>local governments, and the resources that are available for response.</P>
              <P>(2) The establishment of regional and area contingency plans.</P>
              <P>(3) Procedures for undertaking removal actions pursuant to section 311 of the CWA.</P>
              <P>(4) Listing of federal trustees for natural resources for purposes of the CWA.</P>
              <P>(5) Procedures for the participation of other persons in response actions.</P>
              <P>(6) Procedures for compiling and making available cost documentation for response actions.</P>
              <P>(7) National procedures for the use of dispersants and other chemicals in removals under the CWA.</P>
              <P>(c) In implementing the NCP provisions compiled in this appendix, consideration shall be given to international assistance plans and agreements, security regulations and responsibilities based on international agreements, federal statutes, and executive orders. Actions taken pursuant to the provisions of any applicable international joint contingency plans shall be consistent with the NCP to the greatest extent possible. The Department of State shall be consulted, as appropriate, prior to taking action that may affect its activities.</P>

The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line or within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Tributary</E> and <E T="03">tributaries</E>. The terms <E T="03">tributary</E> and <E T="03">tributaries</E> each mean a water that contributes flow, either directly or through another water (including an impoundment identified in paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition), to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition that is characterized by the presence of the physical indicators of a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark. These physical indicators demonstrate there is volume, frequency, and duration of flow sufficient to create a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark, and thus to qualify as a tributary. A tributary can be a natural, man<E T="03">-</E>altered, or man-made water and includes waters such as rivers, streams, canals, and ditches not excluded under paragraph (2) of this definition. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if, for any length, there are one or more constructed breaks (such as bridges, culverts, pipes, or dams), or one or more natural breaks (such as wetlands along the run of a stream, debris piles, boulder fields, or a stream that flows underground) so long as a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark can be identified upstream of the break. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if it contributes flow through a water of the United States that does not meet the definition of tributary or through a non-jurisdictional water to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Wetlands.</E> The term <E T="03">wetlands</E> means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Significant nexus.</E> The term <E T="03">significant nexus</E> means that a water, including wetlands, either alone or in combination with other similarly situated waters in the region, significantly affects the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. The term “in the region” means the watershed that drains to the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. For an effect to be significant, it must be more than speculative or insubstantial. Waters are similarly situated when they function alike and are sufficiently close to function together in affecting downstream waters. For purposes of determining whether or not a water has a significant nexus, the water's effect on downstream (1)(i) through (iii) waters shall be assessed by evaluating the aquatic functions identified in paragraphs (3)(v)(A) through (I) of this definition. A water has a significant nexus when any single function or combination of functions performed by the water, alone or together with similarly situated waters in the region, contributes significantly to the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. Functions relevant to the significant nexus evaluation are the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Sediment trapping,</P>
              <P>(B) Nutrient recycling,</P>
              <P>(C) Pollutant trapping, transformation, filtering, and transport,</P>
              <P>(D) Retention and attenuation of flood waters,</P>

              <P>(F) Contribution of flow,</P>
              <P>(G) Export of organic matter,</P>
              <P>(H) Export of food resources, and</P>
              <P>(I) Provision of life cycle dependent aquatic habitat (such as foraging, feeding, nesting, breeding, spawning, or use as a nursery area) for species located in a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Ordinary high water mark.</E> The term <E T="03">ordinary high water mark</E> means that line on <PRTPAGE P="282"/>the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">High tide line.</E> The term <E T="03">high tide line</E> means the line of intersection of the land with the water's surface at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high tide line may be determined, in the absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and other high tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds such as those accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Applicability date.</E> This definition is applicable beginning on February 6, 2020.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 National response system.</HD>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2.1 Overview.</E> The national response system (NRS) is the mechanism for coordinating response actions by all levels of government in support of the OSC. The NRS is composed of the National Response Team (NRT), Regional Response Teams (RRTs), On-scene coordinator (OSC), Area Committees, and Special Teams and related support entities. The NRS functions as an incident command system (ICS) under the direction of the OSC. Typical of an ICS, the NRS is capable of expanding or contracting to accommodate the response effort required by the size or complexity of the discharge.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2.2 Priorities.</E> (a) Safety of human life must be given the highest priority during every response action. This includes any search and rescue efforts in the general proximity of the discharge and the insurance of safety of response personnel.</P>
              <P>(b) Stabilizing the situation to preclude the event from worsening is the next priority. All efforts must be focused on saving a vessel that has been involved in a grounding, collision, fire or explosion, so that it does not compound the problem. Comparable measures should be taken to stabilize a situation involving a facility, pipeline, or other source of pollution. Stabilizing the situation includes securing the source of the spill and/or removing the remaining oil from the container (vessel, tank, or pipeline) to prevent additional oil spillage, to reduce the need for follow-up response action, and to minimize adverse impact to the environment.</P>
              <P>(c) The response must use all necessary containment and removal tactics in a coordinated manner to ensure a timely, effective response that minimizes adverse impact to the environment.</P>
              <P>(d) All parts of this national response strategy should be addressed concurrently, but safety and stabilization are the highest priorities. The OSC should not delay containment and removal decisions unnecessarily and should take actions to minimize adverse impact to the environment that begins as soon as a discharge occurs, as well as actions to minimize further adverse environmental impact from additional discharges.</P>
              <P>(e) The priorities set forth in this section are broad in nature, and should not be interpreted to preclude the consideration of other priorities that may arise on a site-specific basis.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2.3 Responsibility.</E> (a) The predesignated OSC has the responsibility to direct response actions and coordinate all other response efforts at the scene of an oil discharge or threatened discharge. The OSC monitors or directs all federal, state, local, and private removal actions, or arranges for the removal of an actual or threatened oil discharge, removing and if necessary, requesting authority to destroy a vessel. Additionally, the CWA requires the OSC to direct all federal, state, local, and private removal actions to any incident that poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare.</P>
              <P>(b) Cleanup responsibility for an oil discharge immediately falls on the responsible party, unless the discharge poses a substantial threat to public health or welfare. In a large percentage of oil discharges, the responsible party shall conduct the cleanup. If the responsible party does conduct the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever actions are initiated.</P>
              <P>(1) If effective actions are not being taken to eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly, the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable, continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible parties.</P>

              <P>(2) If the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating determines that there may be an imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare or the environment of the United States (including fish, shellfish, and wildlife, public and private property, shorelines, beaches, habitats, and other living and nonliving natural resources under the jurisdiction or control of the United States, because of an actual or threatened discharge of oil from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or upon the navigable waters of the United States), the Administrator or Secretary may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the relief from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA including administrative orders, that may be necessary to protect the public health or welfare.<PRTPAGE P="285"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The responsible party is liable for costs of federal removal and damages in accordance with section 311(f) of the CWA, section 1002 of the OPA, and other federal laws.</P>
              <P>(c) In those incidents where a discharge or threat of discharge poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a discharge, as appropriate. The OSC shall also request immediate activation of the RRT.</P>
              <P>(d) During responses to any discharge the OSC may request advice or support from the Special Teams and any local support units identified by the Area Committee. Examples include scientific advice from the Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC), technical guidance or prepositioned equipment from the District Response Group (DRG), or public information assistance from the National Strike Force (NSF).</P>
              <P>(e) When an oil discharge exceeds the response capability of the region in which it occurs, transects regional boundaries, or involves a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, substantial amounts of property, or substantial threats to the natural resources, the NRT should be activated as an emergency response team. If appropriate the RRT Chairman may contact the NRT Chairman and request the NRT activation.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Components of national response system and responsibilities.</HD>
              <P>The NRS is the mechanism for coordinating response actions by all levels of government in support of the OSC. The NRS organization is divided into national, regional, and area levels. The national level comprises the NRT, the National Strike Force Coordination Center (NSFCC), and the National Response Center (NRC). The regional level is comprised of the RRT. The area level is made up of the OSC, Special Teams, and Area Committees. The basic framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings together the functions of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC retains authority.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">3.1.1 National response team.</E> (a) National planning and coordination is accomplished through the NRT. The NRT consists of representatives from the USCG, EPA, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Agriculture (DOA), Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of the Interior (DOI), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Labor (DOL), Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of State (DOS), Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and General Services Administration (GSA). Each agency shall designate a member to the team and sufficient alternates to ensure representation, as agency resources permit. The NRT will consider requests for membership on the NRT from other agencies. Other agencies may request membership by forwarding such requests to the chair of the NRT (see Figure 1).</P>
              <P>(b) The chair of the NRT shall be the representative of the EPA and the vice chair shall be the representative of the USCG, with the exception of periods of activation because of response action. During activation, the chair shall be the member agency providing the OSC. The vice chair shall maintain records of NRT activities along with national, regional, and area plans for response actions.</P>
              <P>(c) While the NRT desires to achieve a consensus on all matters brought before it, certain matters may prove unresolvable by this means. In such cases, each agency serving as a participating agency on the NRT may be accorded one vote in NRT proceedings.</P>
              <P>(d) The NRT may establish such bylaws, procedures, and committees as it deems appropriate to further the purposes for which it is established.</P>
              <P>(e) The NRT shall evaluate methods of responding to discharges, shall recommend any changes needed in the response organization, and shall recommend to the Administrator of EPA changes to the NCP designed to improve the effectiveness of the national response system, including drafting of regulatory language.</P>
              <P>(f) The NRT shall provide policy and program direction to the RRTs.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">3.2 Regional.</E> (a) Regional planning and coordination of preparedness and response actions is accomplished through the RRT. In the case of a discharge of oil, preparedness activities shall be carried out in conjunction with Area Committees as appropriate. The RRT agency membership parallels that of the NRT, but also includes state and local representation. The RRT provides: (1) the appropriate regional mechanism for development and coordination of preparedness activities before a response action is taken and for coordination of assistance and advice to the OSC during such response actions; and (2) guidance to Area Committees, as appropriate, to ensure inter-area consistency and consistency of individual ACPs with the RCP and NCP.</P>
              <P>(b) The two principal components of the RRT mechanism are a standing team, which consists of designated representatives from each participating federal agency, state governments, and local governments (as agreed upon by the states); and incident-specific teams formed from the standing team when the RRT is activated for a response. On incident-specific teams, participation by the RRT member agencies will relate to the technical nature of the incident and its geographic location.</P>
              <P>(1) The standing team's jurisdiction corresponds to the standard federal regions, except for Alaska, Oceania in the Pacific, and the Caribbean area, each of which has a separate standing RRT. The role of the standing RRT includes communications systems and procedures, planning, coordination, training, evaluation, preparedness, and related matters on a regionwide basis. It also includes coordination of Area Committees for these functions in areas within their respective regions, as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(2) The role of the incident-specific team is determined by the operational requirements of the response to a specific discharge. Appropriate levels of activation and/or notification of the incident-specific RRT, including <PRTPAGE P="288"/>participation by state and local governments, shall be determined by the designated RRT chair for the incident, based on the RCP. The incident-specific RRT supports the designated OSC. The designated OSC manages response efforts and coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge.</P>
              <P>(c) The representatives of EPA and the USCG shall act as co-chairs of the RRTs except when the RRT is activated. When the RRT is activated for response actions, the chair is the member agency providing the OSC.</P>
              <P>(d) Each participating agency should designate one member and at least one alternate member to the RRT. Agencies whose regional subdivisions do not correspond to the standard federal regions may designate additional representatives to the standing RRT to ensure appropriate coverage of the standard federal region. Participating states may also designate one member and at least one alternate member to the RRT. Indian tribal governments may arrange with the RRT for representation appropriate to their geographical location. All agencies and states may also provide additional representatives as observers to meetings of the RRT.</P>
              <P>(e) RRT members should designate representatives and alternates from their agencies as resource personnel for RRT activities, including RRT work planning, and membership on incident-specific teams in support of the OSCs.</P>
              <P>(f) Federal RRT members or their representatives should provide OSCs with assistance from their respective federal agencies commensurate with agency responsibilities, resources, and capabilities within the region. During a response action, the members of the RRT should seek to make available the resources of their agencies to the OSC as specified in the RCP and ACP.</P>
              <P>(g) RRT members should nominate appropriately qualified representatives from their agencies to work with OSCs in developing and maintaining ACPs.</P>
              <P>(h) Affected states are encouraged to participate actively in all RRT activities. Each state Governor is requested to assign an office or agency to represent the state on the appropriate RRT; to designate representatives to work with the RRT in developing RCPs; to plan for, make available, and coordinate state resources for use in response actions; and to serve as the contact point for coordination of response with local government agencies, whether or not represented on the RRT. The state's RRT representative should keep the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) apprised of RRT activities and coordinate RRT activities with the SERC. Local governments are invited to participate in activities on the appropriate RRT as provided by state law or as arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes are also invited to participate in such activities.</P>
              <P>(i) The standing RRT shall recommend changes in the regional response organization as needed, revise the RCP as needed, evaluate the preparedness of the participating agencies and the effectiveness of ACPs for the federal response to discharges, and provide technical assistance for preparedness to the response community. The RRT should:</P>
              <P>(1) Review and comment, to the extent practicable, on local emergency response plans or other issues related to the preparation, implementation, or exercise of such plans upon request of a local emergency planning committee;</P>
              <P>(2) Evaluate regional and local responses to discharges on a continuing basis, considering available legal remedies, equipment readiness, and coordination among responsible public agencies and private organizations, and recommend improvements;</P>
              <P>(3) Recommend revisions of the NCP to the NRT, based on observations of response operations;</P>
              <P>(4) Review OSC actions to ensure that RCPs and ACPs are effective;</P>
              <P>(5) Encourage the state and local response community to improve its preparedness for response;</P>
              <P>(6) In coordination with the Area Committee and in accordance with any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements, conduct advance planning for use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, burning agents, bioremediation agents, or other chemical agents in accordance with subpart J of this part;</P>
              <P>(7) Be prepared to provide response resources to major discharges or releases outside the region;</P>
              <P>(8) Conduct or participate in training and exercises as necessary to encourage preparedness activities of the response community within the region;</P>
              <P>(9) Meet at least semiannually to review response actions carried out during the preceding period, consider changes in RCPs, and recommend changes in ACPs;</P>
              <P>(10) Provide letter reports on RRT activities to the NRT twice a year, no later than January 31 and July 31; and</P>
              <P>(11) Ensure maximum participation in the national exercise program for announced and unannounced exercises.</P>
              <P>(j)(1) The RRT may be activated by the chair as an incident-specific response team when a discharge:</P>
              <P>(A) Exceeds the response capability available to the OSC in the place where it occurs;</P>
              <P>(B) Transects state boundaries;</P>
              <P>(C) May pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, or to regionally significant amounts of property; or</P>
              <P>(D) Is a worst case discharge, as defined in section 1.5 of this appendix.</P>

              <P>(2) The RRT shall be activated during any discharge upon a request from the OSC, or <PRTPAGE P="289"/>from any RRT representative, to the chair of the RRT. Requests for RRT activation shall later be confirmed in writing. Each representative, or an appropriate alternate, should be notified immediately when the RRT is activated.</P>
              <P>(3) During prolonged removal or remedial action, the RRT may not need to be activated or may need to be activated only in a limited sense, or may need to have available only those member agencies of the RRT who are directly affected or who can provide direct response assistance.</P>
              <P>(4) When the RRT is activated for a discharge or release, agency representatives will meet at the call of the chair and may:</P>
              <P>(A) Monitor and evaluate reports from the OSC, advise the OSC on the duration and extent of response, and recommend to the OSC specific actions to respond to the discharge;</P>
              <P>(B) Request other federal, state, or local governments, or private agencies, to provide resources under their existing authorities to respond to a discharge or to monitor response operations;</P>
              <P>(C) Help the OSC prepare information releases for the public and for communication with the NRT;</P>
              <P>(D) If the circumstances warrant, make recommendations to the regional or district head of the agency providing the OSC that a different OSC should be designated; and</P>
              <P>(E) Submit pollution reports to the NRC as significant developments occur.</P>
              <P>(5) RCPs shall specify detailed criteria for activation of RRTs.</P>
              <P>(6) At the regional level, a Regional Response Center (RRC) may provide facilities and personnel for communications, information storage, and other requirements for coordinating response. The location of each RRC should be provided in the RCP.</P>
              <P>(7) When the RRT is activated, affected states may participate in all RRT deliberations. State government representatives participating in the RRT have the same status as any federal member of the RRT.</P>
              <P>(8) The RRT can be deactivated when the incident-specific RRT chair determines that the OSC no longer requires RRT assistance.</P>
              <P>(9) Notification of the RRT may be appropriate when full activation is not necessary, with systematic communication of pollution reports or other means to keep RRT members informed as to actions of potential concern to a particular agency, or to assist in later RRT evaluation of regionwide response effectiveness.</P>
              <P>(k) Whenever there is insufficient national policy guidance on a matter before the RRT, a technical matter requiring solution, a question concerning interpretation of the NCP, or a disagreement on discretionary actions among RRT members that cannot be resolved at the regional level, it may be referred to the NRT for advice.</P>

This plan, when implemented in conjunction with other provisions of the NCP, shall be adequate to remove a worst case discharge, and to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge, from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility operating in or near the area.</P>
              <P>(b) The areas of responsibility may include several Title III local planning districts, or parts of such districts. In developing the ACP, the OSC shall coordinate with affected SERCs and LEPCs. The ACP shall provide for a well coordinated response that is integrated and compatible to the greatest extent possible with all appropriate response plans of state, local, and non-federal entities, and especially with Title III local emergency response plans.</P>

The annex shall be prepared in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and NOAA and other interested natural resource management agencies and parties. It shall address fish and wildlife resources and their habitat, and shall include other areas considered sensitive environments in a separate section of the annex, based upon Area Committee recommendations. The annex shall provide the necessary information and procedures to immediately and effectively respond to discharges that may adversely affect fish and wildlife and their habitat and sensitive environments, including provisions for a response to a worst case discharge. Such information shall include the identification of appropriate agencies and their responsibilities, procedures to notify these agencies following a discharge or threat of a discharge; protocols for obtaining required fish and wildlife permits and other necessary permits, and provisions to ensure compatibility of annex-related activities with removal operations.</P>
              <P>(b) The annex shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify and establish priorities for fish and wildlife resources and their habitats and other important sensitive areas requiring protection from any direct or indirect effects from discharges that may occur. These effects include, but are not limited to, any seasonal or historical use, as well as all critical, special, significant or otherwise designated protected areas.</P>
              <P>(2) Provide a mechanism to be used during a spill response for timely identification of protection priorities of those fish and wildlife resources and habitats and sensitive environmental areas that may be threatened or injured by a discharge. These include as appropriate, not only marine and freshwater species, habitats, and their food sources, but also terrestrial wildlife and their habitats that may be affected directly by onshore oil or indirectly by oil-related factors, such as loss or contamination of forage. The mechanism shall also provide for expeditious evaluation and appropriate consultations on the effects to fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive environments from the application of chemical countermeasures or other countermeasures not addressed under paragraph (3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) Identify potential environmental effects on fish and wildlife, their habitat, and other sensitive environments resulting from removal actions or countermeasures, including the option of no removal. Based on this evaluation of potential environmental effects, the annex should establish priorities for application of countermeasure and removal actions to habitats within the geographic region of the ACP. The annex should establish methods to minimize the identified effects on fish and wildlife because of response activities, including, but not limited to, disturbance of sensitive areas and habitats; illegal or inadvertent taking or disturbance of <PRTPAGE P="295"/>fish and wildlife or specimens by response personnel; and fish and wildlife, their habitat, and environmentally sensitive areas coming in contact with various cleaning or bioremediation agents. Furthermore, the annex should identify the areas where the movement of oiled debris may pose a risk to resident, transient, or migratory fish and wildlife, and other sensitive environments and should discuss measures to be considered for removing such oiled debris in a timely fashion to reduce such risk.</P>
              <P>(4) Provide for pre-approval of application of specific countermeasures or removal actions that, if expeditiously applied, will minimize adverse spill-induced impacts to fish and wildlife resources, their habitat, and other sensitive environments. Such pre-approval plans must be consistent with paragraphs (2) and (3) of this section and subpart J requirements of the NCP, and must have the concurrence of the natural resource trustees.</P>
              <P>(5) Provide monitoring plan(s) to evaluate the effectiveness of different countermeasures or removal actions in protecting the environment. Monitoring should include “set-aside” or “control” areas, where no mitigative actions are taken.</P>
              <P>(6) Identify and plan for the acquisition and utilization of necessary response capabilities for protection, rescue, and rehabilitation of fish and wildlife resources and habitat. This may include appropriately permitted private organizations and individuals with appropriate expertise and experience. The suitable organizations should be identified in cooperation with natural resource law enforcement agencies. Such capabilities shall include, but not be limited to, identification of facilities and equipment necessary for deterring sensitive fish and wildlife from entering oiled areas, and for capturing, holding, cleaning, and releasing injured wildlife. Plans for the provision of such capabilities shall ensure that there is no interference with other OSC removal operations.</P>
              <P>(7) Identify appropriate federal and state agency contacts and alternates responsible for coordination of fish and wildlife rescue and rehabilitation and protection of sensitive environments; identify and provide for required fish and wildlife handling and rehabilitation permits necessary under federal and state laws; and provide guidance on the implementation of law enforcement requirements included under current federal and state laws and corresponding regulations. Requirements include, but are not limited to procedures regarding the capture, transport, rehabilitation, release of wildlife exposed to or threatened by oil, and disposal of contaminated carcasses of wildlife.</P>
              <P>(8) Identify and secure the means for providing, if needed, the minimum required Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) training for volunteers, including those who assist with injured wildlife.</P>
              <P>(9) Evaluate the compatibility between this annex and non-federal response plans (including those of vessels, facilities and pipelines) on issues affecting fish and wildlife, their habitat, and sensitive environments.</P>

              <P>(a) RRTs and Area Committees shall address, as part of their planning activities, the desirability of using appropriate dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents listed on the NCP Product Schedule, and the desirability of using appropriate burning agents. RCPs and ACPs shall, as appropriate, include applicable preauthorization plans and address the specific contexts in which such products should and should not be used. In meeting the provisions of this paragraph, preauthorization plans may address factors such as the potential sources and types of oil that might be spilled, the existence and location of environmentally sensitive resources that might be impacted by spilled oil, available product and storage locations, available equipment and adequately trained operators, and the available means to monitor product application and effectiveness. The RRT representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees shall review and either approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the preauthorization plans developed by Area Committees, as appropriate. Approved preauthorization plans shall be included in the appropriate RCPs and ACPs. If the RRT representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees approve in advance the use of certain products under specified circumstances as described in the preauthorization plan, the OSC may authorize the use of the products without obtaining the specific concurrences described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) For spill situations that are not addressed by the preauthorization plans developed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents on the oil discharge, provided that the products are listed on the NCP Product Schedule.</P>
              <P>(c) The OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of burning agents on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(d) The OSC may authorize the use of any dispersant, surface washing agent, surface collecting agent, other chemical agent, burning agent, bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent, including products not listed on the NCP Product Schedule, without obtaining the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the discharge, when, in the judgment of the OSC, the use of the product is necessary to prevent or substantially reduce a hazard to human life. Whenever the OSC authorizes the use of a product pursuant to this paragraph, the OSC is to inform the EPA RRT representative and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the affected states and, when practicable, the DOC/DOI natural resource trustees of the use of a product, including products not on the Schedule, as soon as possible. Once the threat to human life has subsided, the continued use of a product shall be in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Sinking agents shall not be authorized for application to oil discharges.</P>

              <P>(b) The first federal official affiliated with an NRT member agency to arrive at the scene of a discharge should coordinate activities under the NCP and is authorized to initiate, in consultation with the OSC, any necessary actions normally carried out by the OSC until the arrival of the predesignated OSC. This official may initiate federal OSLTF-financed actions only as authorized by the OSC or, if the OSC is unavailable, the authorized representative of the lead agency.</P>
              <P>(c) The OSC shall, to the extent practicable, collect pertinent facts about the discharge, such as its source and cause; the identification of responsible parties; the nature, amount, and location of discharged materials; the probable direction and time of travel of discharged materials; whether the discharge is a worst case discharge; the pathways to human and environmental exposure; the potential impact on human health, welfare, and safety and the environment; whether the discharge poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare; the potential impact on natural resources and property which may be affected; priorities for protecting human health and welfare and the environment; and appropriate cost documentation.</P>
              <P>(d) The OSC's efforts shall be coordinated with other appropriate federal, state, local, and private response agencies. OSCs may designate capable persons from federal, state, or local agencies to act as their on-scene representatives. State and local governments, however, are not authorized to take actions under subpart D of the NCP that involve expenditures of the OSLTF unless an appropriate contract or cooperative agreement has been established.</P>
              <P>(e) The OSC should consult regularly with the RRT and NSFCC, as appropriate, in carrying out the NCP and keep the RRT and NSFCC, as appropriate, informed of activities under the NCP.</P>
              <P>(f) The OSC should evaluate incoming information and immediately advise FEMA of potential major disaster situations.</P>

              <P>(h) In those instances where a possible public health emergency exists, the OSC should notify the HHS representative to the RRT. Throughout response actions, the OSC may call upon the OSHA and HHS representative for assistance on worker health and safety issues.</P>
              <P>(i) All federal agencies should plan for emergencies and develop procedures for dealing with oil discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants from vessels and facilities under their jurisdiction. All federal agencies, therefore, are responsible for designating the office that coordinates response to such incidents in accordance with the NCP and applicable federal regulations and guidelines.</P>

              <P>(b) The preliminary assessment shall be conducted using available information, supplemented where necessary and possible by an on-scene inspection. The OSC shall undertake actions to:</P>
              <P>(1) Evaluate the magnitude and severity of the discharge or threat to public health or welfare or the environment;</P>
              <P>(2) Assess the feasibility of removal; and</P>
              <P>(3) To the extent practicable, identify potentially responsible parties.</P>
              <P>(c) Where practicable, the framework for the response management structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings together the functions of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient response, where the OSC maintains authority.</P>
              <P>(d) Except in a case when the OSC is required to direct the response to a discharge that may pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare (including, but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC may allow the responsible party to voluntarily and promptly perform removal actions, provided the OSC determines such actions will ensure an effective and immediate removal of the discharge or mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a discharge. If the responsible party does conduct the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever actions are initiated. If effective actions are not being taken to eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly, the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable, continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible parties.</P>
              <P>(1) In carrying out a response under this section, the OSC may:</P>
              <P>(A) Remove or arrange for the removal of a discharge, and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of a discharge, at any time;</P>
              <P>(B) Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to remove a discharge; and</P>
              <P>(C) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.</P>
              <P>(2) If the discharge results in a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC must direct all response efforts, as provided in section 5.3.4 of this appendix. The OSC should declare as expeditiously as practicable to spill response participants that the federal government will direct the response. The OSC may act without regard to any other provision of the law governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government in removing or arranging for the removal of such a discharge.</P>

              <P>(e) The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are promptly notified in the event of any discharge of oil, to the maximum extent practicable as provided in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex to the ACP for the area in which the discharge occurs. The OSC and the trustees shall coordinate assessments, evaluations, investigations, and planning with respect to appropriate removal actions. The OSC shall consult with the affected trustees on the appropriate removal action to be taken. The trustees will provide timely advice concerning recommended actions with regard to trustee resources potentially affected. The trustees also will assure that the OSC is informed of their activities in natural resource damage assessment that may affect response operations. The trustees shall assure, through the lead administrative trustee, that all data from the natural resource damage assessment activities that may support more effective operational decisions are provided in a timely manner to the OSC. When circumstances permit, the OSC shall share the use of non-monetary response resources (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, personnel and equipment) with the trustees, provided trustee activities do not interfere with response actions. The lead administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication between the OSC and the other trustees during response operations and is responsible for applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is also responsible for applying to the National Pollution Funds Center for funding for initiation of damage assessment for injuries to natural resources.</P>

              <P>(b) The Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating, as appropriate, is authorized to initiate and, in the case of a discharge posing a substantial threat to public health or welfare is required to initiate and direct, appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that any oil is discharged or there is a substantial threat of such discharge from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or on the navigable waters of the United States, on the adjoining shorelines to the navigable waters, into or on the waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under exclusive management authority of the United States.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to any actions taken by a state or local government, the Administrator of EPA or the Secretary of the department in which the USCG is operating may request the U.S. Attorney General to secure the relief from any person, including the owner or operator of the vessel or facility necessary to abate a threat or, after notice to the affected state, take any other action authorized by section 311 of the CWA, including issuing administrative orders, that may be necessary to protect the public health or welfare, if the Administrator or Secretary determines that there may be an imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare or the environment of the United States, including fish, shellfish, and wildlife, public and private property, shorelines, beaches, habitats, and other living and nonliving natural resources under the jurisdiction or control of the United States, because of an actual or threatened discharge of oil from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or upon the navigable waters of the United States.</P>
              <P>(d) Response actions to remove discharges originating from operations conducted subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act shall be in accordance with the NCP.</P>
              <P>(e) Where appropriate, when a discharge involves radioactive materials, the lead or support federal agency shall act consistent with the notification and assistance procedures described in the appropriate Federal Radiological Plan. For the purpose of the NCP, the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP) (50 FR 46542, November 8, 1985) is the appropriate plan. Most radiological discharges and releases do not result in FRERP activation and should be handled in accordance with the NCP. However, releases from nuclear incidents subject to requirements for financial protection established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the Price-Anderson amendments (section 170) of the Atomic Energy Act are specifically excluded from CERCLA and NCP requirements.</P>
              <P>(f) Removal actions involving nuclear weapons should be conducted in accordance with the joint Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and FEMA Agreement for Response to Nuclear Incidents and Nuclear Weapons Significant Incidents (January 8, 1981).</P>
              <P>(g) If the situation is beyond the capability of state and local governments and the statutory authority of federal agencies, the President may, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, act upon a request by the Governor and declare a major disaster or emergency and appoint a FCO to coordinate all federal disaster assistance activities. In such cases, the OSC would continue to carry out OSC responsibilities under the NCP, but would coordinate those activities with the FCO to ensure consistency with other federal disaster assistance activities.</P>
              <P>(h) In the event of a declaration of a major disaster by the President, FEMA may activate the FRP. An FCO, designated by the President, may implement the FRP and coordinate and direct emergency assistance and disaster relief of impacted individuals, business, and public services under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Delivery of federal assistance is facilitated through twelve functional annexes to the FRP known as ESFs. EPA coordinates activities under ESF #10—Hazardous Materials, which addresses preparedness and response to hazardous materials and oil incidents caused by a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. In such cases, the OSC/RPM should coordinate response activities with the FCO, through the incident-specific ESF #10 Chair, to ensure consistency with federal disaster assistance activities.</P>

                <E T="03">5.3.2 General pattern of response.</E> (a) When the OSC receives a report of a discharge, actions normally should be taken in the following sequence:</P>
              <P>(1) Investigate the report to determine pertinent information such as the threat posed to public health or welfare or the environment, the type and quantity of polluting material, and the source of the discharge.</P>
              <P>(2) Officially classify the size (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, minor, medium, major) and type (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, substantial threat to the public health or welfare, worst case discharge) of the discharge and determine the course of action to be followed to ensure effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or prevention of the discharge. Some discharges that are classified as a substantial threat to the public health or welfare may be further classified as a spill of national significance by the Administrator of EPA or the Commandant of the USCG. The appropriate course of action may be prescribed in 5.3.4, 5.3.5, and 5.3.6 of this appendix.<PRTPAGE P="300"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) When the reported discharge is an actual or potential major discharge, the OSC shall immediately notify the RRT and the NRC.</P>
              <P>(B) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential medium discharge exists, the OSC shall recommend activation of the RRT, if appropriate.</P>
              <P>(C) When the investigation shows that an actual or potential minor discharge exists, the OSC shall monitor the situation to ensure that proper removal action is being taken.</P>
              <P>(3) If the OSC determines that effective and immediate removal, mitigation, or prevention of a discharge can be achieved by private party efforts, and where the discharge does not pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, determine whether the responsible party or other person is properly carrying out removal. Removal is being done properly when:</P>
              <P>(A) The responsible party is applying the resources called for in its response plan to effectively and immediately remove, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to public health and welfare and the environment; and</P>
              <P>(B) The removal efforts are in accordance with applicable regulations, including the NCP. Even if the OSC supplements responsible party resources with government resources, the spill response will not be considered improper, unless specifically determined by the OSC.</P>
              <P>(4) Where appropriate, determine whether a state or political subdivision thereof has the capability to carry out any or all removal actions. If so, the OSC may arrange funding to support these actions.</P>
              <P>(5) Ensure prompt notification of the trustees of affected natural resources in accordance with the applicable RCP and ACP.</P>
              <P>(b) Removal shall be considered complete when so determined by the OSC in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected states. When the OSC considers removal complete, OSLTF removal funding shall end. This determination shall not preclude additional removal actions under applicable state law.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">5.3.3 Containment, countermeasures, and cleanup.</E> (a) Defensive actions shall begin as soon as possible to prevent, minimize, or mitigate threat(s) to the public health or welfare or the environment. Actions may include but are not limited to: analyzing water samples to determine the source and spread of the oil; controlling the source of discharge; source and spread control or salvage operations; placement of physical barriers to deter the spread of the oil and to protect natural resources and sensitive ecosystems; measuring and sampling; control of the water discharged from upstream impoundment; and the use of chemicals and other materials in accordance with subpart J of part 300 of the NCP to restrain the spread of the oil and mitigate its effects. The ACP should be consulted for procedures to be followed for obtaining an expedited decision regarding the use of dispersants and other products listed on the NCP Product Schedule.</P>
              <P>(b) As appropriate, actions shall be taken to recover the oil or mitigate its effects. Of the numerous chemical or physical methods that may be used, the chosen methods shall be the most consistent with protecting public health and welfare and the environment. Sinking agents shall not be used.</P>
              <P>(c) Oil and contaminated materials recovered in cleanup operations shall be disposed of in accordance with the RCP, ACP, and any applicable laws, regulations, or requirements. RRT and Area Committee guidelines may identify the disposal options available during an oil spill response and may describe what disposal requirements are mandatory or may not be waived by the OSC. ACP guidelines should address: the sampling, testing, and classifying of recovered oil and oiled debris; the segregation and stockpiling of recovered oil and oiled debris; prior state disposal approvals and permits; and the routes; methods (e.g. recycle/reuse, on-site burning, incineration, landfilling, etc.); and sites for the disposal of collected oil, oiled debris, and animal carcasses; procedures for obtaining waivers, exemptions, or authorizations associated with handling or transporting waste materials. The ACPs may identify a hierachy of preferences for disposal alternatives, with recycling (reprocessing) being the most preferred, and other alternatives preferred based on priorities for health or the environment.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">5.3.4 Response to a substantial threat to the public health or welfare.</E> (a) The OSC shall determine whether a discharge results in a substantial threat to public health or welfare (including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, the public and private beaches, and shorelines of the United States). Factors to be considered by the OSC in making this determination include, but are not limited to, the size of the discharge, the character of the discharge, and the nature of the threat to public health or welfare. Upon obtaining such information, the OSC shall conduct an evaluation of the threat posed, based on the OSC's experience in assessing other discharges and consultation with senior lead agency officials and readily available authorities on issues outside the OSC's technical expertise.</P>

              <P>(b) If the investigation by the OSC shows that the discharge poses or may present a substantial threat to public health or welfare, the OSC shall direct all federal, state, or private actions to remove the discharge or to mitigate or prevent the threat of such a discharge, as appropriate. In directing the response in such cases, the OSC may act without regard to any other provision of law <PRTPAGE P="301"/>governing contracting procedures or employment of personnel by the federal government to:</P>
              <P>(1) Remove or arrange for the removal of the discharge;</P>
              <P>(2) Mitigate or prevent the substantial threat of the discharge; and</P>
              <P>(3) Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of a substantial threat to the public health or welfare, the OSC shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Assess opportunities for the use of various special teams and other assistance, including the use of the services of the NSFCC, as appropriate;</P>
              <P>(2) Request immediate activation of the RRT; and</P>
              <P>(3) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate, including but not limited to implementation of the ACP or relevant tank vessel or facility response plan.</P>
              <P>(d) When requested by the OSC, the lead agency or RRT shall dispatch appropriate personnel to the scene of the discharge to assist the OSC. This assistance may include technical support in the agency's areas of expertise and disseminating information to the public. The lead agency shall ensure that a contracting officer is available on scene, at the request of the OSC.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">5.3.5 Enhanced activities during a spill of national significance.</E> (a) A discharge may be classified as an SONS by the Administrator of EPA for discharges occurring in the inland zone and the Commandant of the USCG for discharges occurring in the coastal zone.</P>
              <P>(b) For an SONS in the inland zone, the EPA Administrator may name a senior Agency official to assist the OSC in: (1) Communicating with affected parties and the public; and (2) coordinating federal, state, local, and international resources at the national level. This strategic coordination will involve, as appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or other chief executive(s) of local government(s).</P>
              <P>(c) For an SONS in the coastal zone, the USCG Commandant may name a National Incident Commander (NIC) who will assume the role of the OSC in: (1) Communicating with affected parties and the public; and (2) coordinating federal, state, local, and international resources at the national level. This strategic coordination shall involve, as appropriate, the NRT, RRT(s), the Governor(s) of affected state(s), and the mayor(s) or other chief executive(s) of local government(s).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">5.3.6 Response to worst case discharges.</E> (a) If the investigation by the OSC shows that a discharge is a worst case discharge as defined in the ACP, or there is a substantial threat of such a discharge, the OSC shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Notify the NSFCC;</P>
              <P>(2) Require, where applicable, implementation of the worst case portion of an approved tank vessel or facility response plan;</P>
              <P>(3) Implement the worst case portion of the ACP, if appropriate; and</P>
              <P>(4) Take whatever additional response actions are deemed appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) Under the direction of the OSC, the NSFCC shall coordinate use of private and public personnel and equipment, including strike teams, to remove a worst case discharge and mitigate or prevent a substantial threat of such a discharge.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">5.3.7 Multi-regional responses.</E> (a) If a discharge moves from the area covered by one ACP or RCP into another area, the authority for response actions should likewise shift. If a discharge affects areas covered by two or more ACPs or RCPs, the response mechanisms of each applicable plan may be activated. In this case, response actions of all regions concerned shall be fully coordinated as detailed in the RCPs and ACPs.</P>
              <P>(b) There shall be only one OSC at any time during the course of a response operation. Should a discharge affect two or more areas, EPA, the USCG, DOD, DOE, or other lead agency, as appropriate, shall give prime consideration to the area vulnerable to the greatest threat, in determining which agency should provide the OSC. The RRT shall designate the OSC if the RRT member agencies who have response authority within the affected areas are unable to agree on the designation. The NRT shall designate the OSC if members of one RRT or two adjacent RRTs are unable to agree on the designation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">5.3.8 Worker health and safety.</E> (a) Response actions under the NCP shall comply with the provisions for response action worker safety and health in 29 CFR 1910.120. The national response system meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120 concerning use of an incident command system.</P>
              <P>(b) In a response action taken by a responsible party, the responsible party must assure that an occupational safety and health program consistent with 29 CFR 1910.120 is made available for the protection of workers at the response site.</P>
              <P>(c) In a response taken under the NCP by a lead agency, an occupational safety and health program should be made available for the protection of workers at the response site, consistent with, and to the extent required by, 29 CFR 1910.120. Contracts relating to a response action under the NCP should contain assurances that the contractor at the response site will comply with this program and with any applicable provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) and state laws with plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act.</P>

              <P>(d) When a state, or political subdivision of a state, without an OSHA-approved state plan is the lead agency for response, the state or political subdivision must comply <PRTPAGE P="302"/>with standards in 40 CFR part 311, promulgated by the EPA pursuant to section 126(f) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA).</P>
              <P>(e) Requirements, standards, and regulations of the OSH Act and of state OSH laws not directly referenced in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, must be complied with where applicable. Federal OSH Act requirements include, among other things, Construction Standards (29 CFR part 1926), General Industry Standards (29 CFR part 1910), and the general duty requirement of section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 654(a)(1)). No action by the lead agency with respect to response activities under the NCP constitutes an exercise of statutory authority within the meaning of section 4(b)(1) of the OSH Act. All governmental agencies and private employers are directly responsible for the health and safety of their own employees.</P>

              <P>(b) Anyone desiring to file a claim against the OSLTF may obtain general information on the procedure for filing a claim from the Director, National Pollution Funds Center, Suite 1000, 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia, 22203-1804, (703) 235-4756.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.7 Documentation and Cost Recovery.</HD>
              <P>(a) All OSLTF users need to collect and maintain documentation to support all actions taken under the CWA. In general, documentation shall be sufficient to support full cost recovery for resources utilized and shall identify the source and circumstances of the incident, the responsible party or parties, and impacts and potential impacts to public health and welfare and the environment. Documentation procedures are contained in 33 CFR subchapter M.</P>
              <P>(b) When appropriate, documentation shall also be collected for scientific understanding of the environment and for research and development of improved response methods and technology. Funding for these actions is restricted by section 6002 of the OPA.</P>
              <P>(c) As requested by the NRT or RRT, the OSC shall submit to the NRT or RRT a complete report on the removal operation and the actions taken. The OSC report shall record the situation as it developed, the actions taken, the resources committed, and the problems encountered. The RRT shall review the OSC report with its comments or recommendations within 30 days after the RRT has received the OSC report.</P>
              <P>(d) OSCs shall ensure the necessary collection and safeguarding of information, samples, and reports. Samples and information shall be gathered expeditiously during the response to ensure an accurate record of the impacts incurred. Documentation materials shall be made available to the trustees of affected natural resources. The OSC shall make available to the trustees of affected natural resources information and documentation in the OSC's possession that can assist the trustees in the determination of actual or potential natural resource injuries.</P>
              <P>(e) Information and reports obtained by the EPA or USCG OSC shall be transmitted to the appropriate offices responsible for follow-up actions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.8 National response priorities</HD>
              <P>(a) Safety of human life must be given the top priority during every response action. This includes any search and rescue efforts in the general proximity of the discharge and the insurance of safety of response personnel.</P>
              <P>(b) Stabilizing the situation to preclude the event from worsening is the next priority. All efforts must be focused on saving a vessel that has been involved in a grounding, collision, fire, or explosion, so that it does not compound the problem. Comparable measures should be taken to stabilize a situation involving a facility, pipeline, or other source of pollution. Stabilizing the situation includes securing the source of the spill and/or removing the remaining oil from the container (vessel, tank, or pipeline) to prevent additional oil spillage, to reduce the need for follow-up response action, and to minimize adverse impact to the environment.</P>
              <P>(c) The response must use all necessary containment and removal tactics in a coordinated manner to ensure a timely, effective response that minimizes adverse impact to the environment.</P>
              <P>(d) All parts of this national response strategy should be addressed concurrently, but safety and stabilization are the highest priorities. The OSC should not delay containment and removal decisions unnecessarily and should take actions to minimize adverse impact to the environment that begin as soon as a discharge occurs, as well as actions to minimize further adverse environmental impact from additional discharges.</P>
              <P>(e) The priorities set forth in this section are broad in nature, and should not be interpreted to preclude the consideration of other priorities that may arise on a site-specific basis.</P>

                <E T="03">6.1 Nongovernmental participation.</E> (a) Industry groups, academic organizations, and others are encouraged to commit resources for response operations. Specific commitments should be listed in the RCP and ACP. Those entities required to develop tank vessel and facility response plans under CWA section 311(j) must be able to respond to a worst case discharge to the maximum extent practicable, and should commit sufficient resources to implement other aspects of those plans.</P>
              <P>(b) The technical and scientific information generated by the local community, along with information from federal, state, and local governments, should be used to assist the OSC in devising response strategies where effective standard techniques are unavailable. Such information and strategies will be incorporated into the ACP, as appropriate. The SSC may act as liaison between the OSC and such interested organizations.</P>

              <P>(c) ACPs shall establish procedures to allow for well organized, worthwhile, and safe use of volunteers, including compliance with requirements regarding worker health and safety. ACPs should provide for the direction of volunteers by the OSC or by other federal, state, or local officials knowledgeable in contingency operations and capable of providing leadership. ACPs also should <PRTPAGE P="306"/>identify specific areas in which volunteers can be used, such as beach surveillance, logistical support, and bird and wildlife treatment. Unless specifically requested by the OSC, volunteers generally should not be used for physical removal or remedial activities. If, in the judgment of the OSC, dangerous conditions exist, volunteers shall be restricted from on-scene operations.</P>
              <P>(d) Nongovernmental participation must be in compliance with the requirements of subpart H of the NCP if any recovery of costs will be sought.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">6.2.1 Federal agencies.</E> (a) The President is required to designate in the NCP those federal officials who are to act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural resources. These designated federal officials shall act pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA. “Natural resources” means land, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, ground water, drinking water supplies, and other such resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled (hereinafter referred to as “managed or controlled”) by the United States, including the resources of the exclusive economic zone.</P>
              <P>(b) The following individuals shall be the designated trustee(s) for general categories of natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems. They are authorized to act pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA when there is injury to, destruction of, loss of, or threat to natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems as a result of a discharge of oil. Notwithstanding the other designations in this section, the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior shall act as trustees of those resources subject to their respective management or control.</P>
              <P>(1) The Secretary of Commerce shall act as trustee for natural resources managed or controlled by DOC and for natural resources managed or controlled by other federal agencies and that are found in, under, or using waters navigable by deep draft vessels, tidally influenced waters or waters of the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone, and the outer continental shelf. However, before the Secretary takes an action with respect to an affected resource under the management or control of another federal agency, he shall, whenever practicable, seek to obtain concurrence of that other federal agency. Examples of the Secretary's trusteeship include the following natural resources and their supporting ecosystems: marine fishery resources; anadromous fish; endangered species and marine mammals; and the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries and National Estuarine Research Reserves.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary of the Interior shall act as trustee for natural resources managed or controlled by DOI. Examples of the Secretary's trusteeship include the following natural resources and their supporting ecosystems: migratory birds; anadromous fish; endangered species and marine mammals; federally owned minerals; and certain federally managed water resources. The Secretary of the Interior shall also be trustee for those natural resources for which an Indian tribe would otherwise act as trustee in those cases where the United States acts on behalf of the Indian tribe.</P>
              <P>(3) Secretary for the land managing agency. For natural resources located on, over, or under land administered by the United States, the trustee shall be the head of the department in which the land managing agency is found. The trustees for the principal federal land managing agencies are the Secretaries of DOI, USDA, DOD, and DOE.</P>
              <P>(4) Head of Authorized Agencies. For natural resources located within the United States but not otherwise described in this section, the trustee is the head of the federal agency or agencies authorized to manage or control those resources.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">6.2.2 State.</E> (a) State trustees shall act on behalf of the public as trustees for natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, within the boundary of a state or belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such state. For the purposes of section 6.1, the definition of the term “state” does not include Indian tribes.</P>
              <P>(b) The Governor of a state is encouraged to designate a lead state trustee to coordinate all state trustee responsibilities with other trustee agencies and with response activities of the RRT and OSC. The state's lead trustee would designate a representative to serve as a contact with the OSC. This individual should have ready access to appropriate state officials with environmental protection, emergency response, and natural resource responsibilities. The EPA Administrator or USCG Commandant or their designees may appoint the lead state trustee as a member of the Area Committee. Response strategies should be coordinated between the state and other trustees and the OSC for specific natural resource locations in an inland or coastal zone, and should be included in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive Environments Plan annex of the ACP.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">6.2.3 Indian tribes.</E> The tribal chairmen (or heads of the governing bodies) of Indian tribes, as defined in section 1.5, or a person designated by the tribal officials, shall act on behalf of the Indian tribes as trustees for the natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such Indian tribe, or held in trust for the benefit of such Indian tribe, or belonging to a member of such Indian tribe, if such resources are subject to a trust restriction on alienation. When the tribal chairman or head of the tribal governing body designates another <PRTPAGE P="307"/>person as trustee, the tribal chairman or head of the tribal governing body shall notify the President of such designation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">6.2.4 Foreign trustees.</E> Pursuant to section 1006 of the OPA, foreign trustees shall act on behalf of the head of a foreign government as trustees for natural resources belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to such foreign government.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.3 Federal agencies.</HD>
              <P>(a) Federal agencies listed in this appendix have duties established by statute, executive order, or Presidential directive which may apply to federal response actions following, or in prevention of, the discharge of oil. Some of these agencies also have duties relating to the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of equivalent natural resources injured or lost as a result of such discharge. The NRT, RRT, and Area Committee organizational structure, and the NCP, RCPs, and ACPs provide for agencies to coordinate with each other in carrying out these duties.</P>
              <P>(b) Federal agencies may be called upon by an OSC during response planning and implementation to provide assistance in their respective areas of expertise, consistent with the agencies' capabilities and authorities.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to their general responsibilities, federal agencies should:</P>

In addition to this expertise, NOAA provides SSCs in the coastal zone, as described under section 3.3.3 of this appendix, Special teams.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">6.4.2 Department of Justice.</E> The DOJ can provide expert advice on complicated legal questions arising from discharges, and federal agency responses. In addition, the DOJ represents the federal government, including its agencies, in litigation relating to such discharges. Other legal issues or questions shall be directed to the federal agency counsel for the agency providing the OSC for the response.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">6.4.3 Department of Defense.</E> The DOD has responsibility to take all action necessary with respect to discharges where either the discharge is on, or the sole source of a discharge is from, any facility or vessel under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOD. In addition to those capabilities provided by SUPSALV, DOD may also, consistent with its operational requirements and upon request of the OSC, provide locally deployed USN oil spill response equipment and provide assistance to other federal agencies upon request. The following two branches of DOD have particularly relevant expertise:</P>
              <P>(a) The United States Army Corps of Engineers has specialized equipment and personnel for maintaining navigation channels, for removing navigation obstructions, for accomplishing structural repairs, and for performing maintenance to hydropower electric generating equipment. The Corps can also provide design services, perform construction, and provide contract writing and contract administrative services for other federal agencies.</P>
              <P>(b) The U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage (SUPSLAV) is the branch of the service within DOD most knowledgeable and experienced in ship salvage, shipboard damage control, and diving. The USN has an extensive array of specialized equipment and personnel available for use in these areas as well as specialized containment, collection, and removal equipment specifically designed for salvage-related and open-sea pollution incidents.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">6.4.4 Department of Health and Human Services.</E> (a) The HHS assists with the assessment, preservation, and protection of human health and helps ensure the availability of essential human services. HHS provides technical and nontechnical assistance in the form of advice, guidance, and resources to other federal agencies as well as state and local governments.</P>

              <P>(b) The principal HHS response comes from the U.S. Public Health Service and is coordinated from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and various Public Health Service regional offices. Within the Public Health Service, the primary response to a <PRTPAGE P="308"/>hazardous materials emergency comes from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Both ATSDR and CDC have a 24-hour emergency response capability wherein scientific and technical personnel are available to provide technical assistance to the lead federal agency and state and local response agencies on human health threat assessment and analysis, and exposure prevention and mitigation. Such assistance is used for situations requiring evacuation of affected areas, human exposure to hazardous materials, and technical advice on mitigation and prevention. CDC takes the lead during petroleum releases regulated under the CWA and OPA while ATSDR takes the lead during chemical releases under CERCLA. Both agencies are mutually supportive.</P>
              <P>(c) Other Public Health Service agencies involved in support during hazardous materials incidents either directly or through ATSDR/CDC include the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health.</P>
              <P>(d) Statutory authority for HHS/National Institutes for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) involvement in hazardous materials accident prevention is non-regulatory in nature and focused on two primary areas for preventing community and worker exposure to hazardous materials releases: (1) worker safety training and (2) basic research activities. Under section 126 of the SARA, NIEHS is given statutory authority for supporting development of curricula and model training programs for waste workers and chemical emergency responders. Under section 118(b) of the Hazardous Materials Transportation and Uniform Safety Act, NIEHS also administers the Hazmat Employee Training Program to prepare curricula and training for hazardous materials transportation workers. In the basic research arena, NIEHS is authorized under section 311 of SARA to conduct a hazardous substance basic research and training program to evaluate toxic effects and assess human health risks from accidental releases of hazardous materials. Under Title IX, section 901(h) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, NIEHS also is authorized to conduct basic research on air pollutants, as well as train physicians in environmental health. Federal research and training in hazardous materials release prevention represents an important non-regulatory activity and supplements ongoing private sector programs.</P>

              <P>(a) Each state Governor is requested to designate one state office/representative to represent the state on the appropriate RRT. The state's office/representative may participate fully in all activities of the appropriate RRT. Each state Governor is also requested to designate a lead state agency that shall direct state-lead response operations. This agency is responsible for designating the OSC for state-lead response actions, and coordinating/communicating with any other state agencies, as appropriate. Local governments are invited to participate in activities on the appropriate RRT as may be provided by state law or arranged by the state's representative. Indian tribes wishing to participate should assign one person or office to represent the tribal government on the appropriate RRT.</P>
              <P>(b) Appropriate state and local officials (including Indian tribes) shall participate as part of the response structure as provided in the ACP.</P>

The waters identified in each of paragraphs (1)(vii)(A) through (E) of this definition are similarly situated and shall be combined, for purposes of a significant nexus analysis, in the watershed that drains to the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. Waters identified in this paragraph shall not be combined with waters identified in paragraph (1)(vi) of this definition when performing a significant nexus analysis. If waters identified in this paragraph are also an adjacent water under paragraph (1)(vi), they are an adjacent water and no case-specific significant nexus analysis is required.</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Prairie potholes.</E> Prairie potholes are a complex of glacially formed wetlands, usually occurring in depressions that lack permanent natural outlets, located in the upper Midwest.</P>

For waters determined to have a significant nexus, the entire water is a water of the United States if a portion is located within the 100-year floodplain of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition or within 4,000 feet of the high tide line or ordinary high water mark. Waters identified in this paragraph shall not be combined with waters identified in paragraph (1)(vi) of this definition when performing a significant nexus analysis. If waters identified in this paragraph are also an adjacent water under paragraph (1)(vi), they are an adjacent water and no case-specific significant nexus analysis is required.</P>
            <P>(2) The following are not “waters of the United States” even where they otherwise meet the terms of paragraphs (1)(iv) through (viii) of this definition.</P>

            <P>(3) In this definition, the following terms apply:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Adjacent.</E> The term <E T="03">adjacent</E> means bordering, contiguous, or neighboring a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition, including waters separated by constructed dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes, and the like. For purposes of adjacency, an open water such as a pond or lake includes any wetlands within or abutting its ordinary high water mark. Adjacency is not limited to waters located laterally to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition. Adjacent waters also include all waters that connect segments of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) or are located at the head of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition and are bordering, contiguous, or neighboring such water. Waters being used for established normal farming, ranching, and silviculture activities (33 U.S.C. 1344(f)) are not adjacent.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Neighboring.</E> The term <E T="03">neighboring</E> means:</P>
            <P>(A) All waters located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark;</P>
            <P>(B) All waters located within the 100-year floodplain of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (v) of this definition and not more than 1,500 feet from the ordinary high water mark of such water. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark and within the 100-year floodplain;</P>
            <P>(C) All waters located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) or (iii) of this definition, and all waters within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line or within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Tributary</E> and <E T="03">tributaries.</E> The terms <E T="03">tributary</E> and <E T="03">tributaries</E> each mean a water that contributes flow, either directly or through another water (including an impoundment identified in paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition), to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition that is characterized by the presence of the physical indicators of a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark. These physical indicators demonstrate there is volume, frequency, and duration of flow sufficient to create a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark, and thus to qualify as a tributary. A tributary can be a natural, man-altered, or man-made <PRTPAGE P="313"/>water and includes waters such as rivers, streams, canals, and ditches not excluded under paragraph (2) of this definition. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if, for any length, there are one or more constructed breaks (such as bridges, culverts, pipes, or dams), or one or more natural breaks (such as wetlands along the run of a stream, debris piles, boulder fields, or a stream that flows underground) so long as a bed and banks and an ordinary high water mark can be identified upstream of the break. A water that otherwise qualifies as a tributary under this definition does not lose its status as a tributary if it contributes flow through a water of the United States that does not meet the definition of tributary or through a non-jurisdictional water to a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Wetlands.</E> The term <E T="03">wetlands</E> means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Significant nexus.</E> The term <E T="03">significant nexus</E> means that a water, including wetlands, either alone or in combination with other similarly situated waters in the region, significantly affects the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. The term “in the region” means the watershed that drains to the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. For an effect to be significant, it must be more than speculative or insubstantial. Waters are similarly situated when they function alike and are sufficiently close to function together in affecting downstream waters. For purposes of determining whether or not a water has a significant nexus, the water's effect on downstream (1)(i) through (iii) waters shall be assessed by evaluating the aquatic functions identified in paragraphs (3)(v)(A) through (I) of this definition. A water has a significant nexus when any single function or combination of functions performed by the water, alone or together with similarly situated waters in the region, contributes significantly to the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of the nearest water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this definition. Functions relevant to the significant nexus evaluation are the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Sediment trapping,</P>
            <P>(B) Nutrient recycling,</P>
            <P>(C) Pollutant trapping, transformation, filtering, and transport,</P>
            <P>(D) Retention and attenuation of flood waters,</P>
            <P>(E) Runoff storage,</P>
            <P>(F) Contribution of flow,</P>
            <P>(G) Export of organic matter,</P>
            <P>(H) Export of food resources, and</P>
            <P>(I) Provision of life cycle dependent aquatic habitat (such as foraging, feeding, nesting, breeding, spawning, or use as a nursery area) for species located in a water identified in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Ordinary high water mark.</E> The term <E T="03">ordinary high water mark</E> means that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas.</P>
            <P>(vii) <E T="03">High tide line.</E> The term <E T="03">high tide line</E> means the line of intersection of the land with the water's surface at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The high tide line may be determined, in the absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation lines, tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and other high tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by <PRTPAGE P="314"/>strong winds such as those accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Applicability date.</E> This definition is applicable beginning on February 6, 2020.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Offshore facility</E> means any facility of any kind located in, on, or under, any of the navigable waters of the United States, and any facility of any kind which is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and is located in, on, or under any other waters, other than a vessel or a public vessel;</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Onshore facility</E> means any facility (including, but not limited to, motor vehicles and rolling stock) of any kind located in, on, or under, any land or non-navigable waters within the United States;</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Person</E> means an individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, joint venture, commercial entity, United States Government, State, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body;</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Release</E> means any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment (including the abandonment or discarding of barrels, containers, and other closed receptacles containing any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant), but excludes:</P>
            <P>(1) Any release which results in exposure to persons solely within a workplace, with respect to a claim which such persons may assert against the employer of such persons;</P>
            <P>(2) Emissions from the engine exhaust of a motor vehicle, rolling stock, aircraft, vessel, or pipeline pumping station engine;</P>

            <P>(4) The normal application of fertilizer;</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Reportable quantity</E> (“RQ”) means that quantity, as set forth in this part, the release of which requires notification pursuant to this part;</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Vessel</E> means every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.</P>

The RQs in table 302.4 are in units of pounds based on chemical toxicity, while the RQs in appendix B to table 302.4 are in units of curies based on radiation hazard. Whenever the RQs in table 302.4 and appendix B to the table are in conflict, the lowest RQ shall apply.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Unlisted hazardous substances.</E> Unlisted hazardous substances designated by 40 CFR 302.4(b) have the reportable quantity of 100 pounds, except for those unlisted hazardous wastes which exhibit toxicity identified in 40 CFR 261.24. Unlisted hazardous wastes which exhibit toxicity have the reportable quantities listed in Table 302.4 for the contaminant on which the characteristic of toxicity is based. The reportable quantity applies to the waste itself, not merely to the toxic contaminant. If an unlisted hazardous waste exhibits toxicity on the basis of more than one contaminant, the reportable quantity for that waste shall be the lowest of the reportable quantities listed in Table 302.4 for those contaminants. If an unlisted hazardous waste exhibits the characteristic of toxicity and one or more of the other characteristics referenced in 40 CFR 302.4(b), the reportable quantity for that waste shall be the lowest of the applicable reportable quantities.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Continuous releases.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no notification is required for any release of a hazardous substance that is, pursuant to the definitions in paragraph (b) of this section, continuous and stable in quantity and rate.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to notification of continuous releases:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Continuous.</E> A continuous release is a release that occurs without interruption or abatement or that is routine, anticipated, and intermittent and incidental to normal operations or treatment processes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Normal range.</E> The normal range of a release is all releases (in pounds or kilograms) of a hazardous substance reported or occurring over any 24-hour period under normal operating conditions during the preceding year. Only releases that are both continuous and <PRTPAGE P="363"/>stable in quantity and rate may be included in the normal range.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Routine.</E> A routine release is a release that occurs during normal operating procedures or processes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Stable in quantity and rate.</E> A release that is stable in quantity and rate is a release that is predictable and regular in amount and rate of emission.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Statistically significant increase.</E> A statistically significant increase in a release is an increase in the quantity of the hazardous substance released above the upper bound of the reported normal range of the release.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The following notifications shall be given for any release qualifying for reduced reporting under this section:</P>
            <P>(1) Initial telephone notification;</P>
            <P>(2) Initial written notification within 30 days of the initial telephone notification;</P>
            <P>(3) Follow-up notification within 30 days of the first anniversary date of the initial written notification;</P>
            <P>(4) Notification of a change in the composition or source(s) of the release or in the other information submitted in the initial written notification of the release under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or the follow-up notification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(5) Notification at such times as an increase in the quantity of the hazardous substance being released during any 24-hour period represents a statistically significant increase as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Initial telephone notification.</E> Prior to making an initial telephone notification of a continuous release, the person in charge of a facility or vessel must establish a sound basis for qualifying the release for reporting under CERCLA section 103(f)(2) by:</P>
            <P>(1) Using release data, engineering estimates, knowledge of operating procedures, or best professional judgment to establish the continuity and stability of the release;</P>
            <P>(2) Reporting the release to the National Response Center for a period sufficient to establish the continuity and stability of the release; or</P>
            <P>(3) When a person in charge of the facility or vessel believes that a basis has been established to qualify the release for reduced reporting under this section, initial notification to the National Response Center shall be made by telephone. The person in charge must identify the notification as an initial continuous release notification report and provide the following information:</P>
            <P>(i) The name and location of the facility or vessel; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The name(s) and identity(ies) of the hazardous substance(s) being released.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Initial written notification.</E> Initial written notification of a continuous release shall be made to the appropriate EPA Regional Office for the geographical area where the releasing facility or vessel is located. (Note: In addition to the requirements of this part, releases of CERCLA hazardous substances are also subject to the provisions of SARA title III section 304, and EPA's implementing regulations codified at 40 CFR part 355, which require initial telephone and written notifications of continuous releases to be submitted to the appropriate State emergency response commission and local emergency planning committee.)</P>
            <P>(1) Initial written notification to the appropriate EPA Regional Office shall occur within 30 days of the initial telephone notification to the National Response Center, and shall include, for each release for which reduced reporting as a continuous release is claimed, the following information:</P>
            <P>(i) The name of the facility or vessel; the location, including the latitude and longitude; the case number assigned by the National Response Center or the Environmental Protection Agency; the Dun and Bradstreet number of the facility, if available; the port of registration of the vessel; the name and telephone number of the person in charge of the facility or vessel.</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Changes in other reported information.</E> If there is a change in any information submitted in the initial written notification or the followup notification other than a change in the source, composition, or quantity of the release, the person in charge of the facility or vessel shall provide written notification of the change to the EPA Region for the geographical area where the facility or vessel is located, within 30 days of determining that the information submitted previously is no longer valid. Notification shall include the reason for the change, and the basis for stating that the release is continuous and stable under the changed conditions.</P>
            <P>(4) Notification of changes shall include the case number assigned by the National Response Center or the Environmental Protection Agency and also the signed certification statement required at (c)(2)(xi) of this section.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Notification of a statistically significant increase in a release.</E> Notification of a statistically significant increase in a release shall be made to the National Response Center as soon as the person in charge of the facility or vessel has knowledge of the increase. The release must be identified as a statistically significant increase in a continuous release. A determination of whether an increase is a “statistically significant increase” shall be made based upon calculations or estimation procedures that will identify releases that exceed the upper bound of the reported normal range.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Annual evaluation of releases.</E> Each hazardous substance release shall be evaluated annually to determine if changes have occurred in the information submitted in the initial written notification, the followup notification, and/or in a previous change notification.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Use of the SARA Title III section 313 form.</E> In lieu of an initial written report <PRTPAGE P="366"/>or a followup report, owners or operators of facilities subject to the requirements of SARA title III section 313 may submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office for the geographical area where the facility is located, a copy of the Toxic Release Inventory form submitted under SARA Title III section 313 the previous July 1, provided that the following information is added:</P>
            <P>(1) The population density within a one-mile radius of the facility or vessel, described in terms of the following ranges: 0-50 persons, 51-100 persons, 101-500 persons, 501-1,000 persons, more than 1,000 persons.</P>
            <P>(2) The identity and location of sensitive populations and ecosystems within a one-mile radius of the facility or vessel (e.g., elementary schools, hospitals, retirement communities, or wetlands).</P>
            <P>(3) For each hazardous substance release claimed to qualify for reporting under CERCLA section 103(f)(2), the following information must be supplied:</P>
            <P>(i) The upper and lower bounds of the normal range of the release (in pounds or kilograms) over the previous year.</P>
            <P>(ii) The frequency of the release and the fraction of the release from each release source and the specific period over which it occurs.</P>
            <P>(iii) A brief statement describing the basis for stating that the release is continuous and stable in quantity and rate.</P>
            <P>(iv) A signed statement that the hazardous substance release(s) is(are) continuous and stable in quantity and rate under the definitions in paragraph (b) of this section and that all reported information is accurate and current to the best knowledge of the person in charge.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Documentation supporting notification.</E> Where necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section, the person in charge may rely on recent release data, engineering estimates, the operating history of the facility or vessel, or other relevant information to support notification. All supporting documents, materials, and other information shall be kept on file at the facility, or in the case of a vessel, at an office within the United States in either a port of call, a place of regular berthing, or the headquarters of the business operating the vessel. Supporting materials shall be kept on file for a period of one year and shall substantiate the reported normal range of releases, the basis for stating that the release is continuous and stable in quantity and rate, and the other information in the initial written report, the followup report, and the annual evaluations required under paragraphs (e), (f), and (i), respectively. Such information shall be made available to EPA upon request as necessary to enforce the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Multiple concurrent releases.</E> Multiple concurrent releases of the same substance occurring at various locations with respect to contiguous plants or installations upon contiguous grounds that are under common ownership or control may be considsred separately or added together in determining whether such releases constitute a continuous release or a statistically significant increase under the definitions in paragraph (b) of this section; whichever approach is elected for purposes of determining whether a release is continuous also must be used to determine a statistically significant increase in the release.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Penalties for failure to comply.</E> The reduced reporting requirements provided for under this section shall apply only so long as the person in charge complies fully with all requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. Failure to comply with respect to any release from the facility or vessel shall subject the person in charge to all of the reporting requirements of § 302.6 for each such release, to the penalties under § 302.7, and to any other applicable penalties provided for by law.</P>

              <P>(c) To be eligible for an award, the informant must disclose the identity of person(s) [or other pertinent information that leads to the expeditious disclosure of the identity of said person(s)] criminally culpable for the violations set forth in § 303.12 of subpart A.

              <SECTNO>§ 304.20</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Jurisdiction of Arbitrator.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In accordance with the procedures established by this part, the Arbitrator is authorized to arbitrate one or more issues arising in an EPA claim when:</P>
              <P>(1) The total past and projected response costs for the facility concerned do not exceed $500,000, excluding interest; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator and one or more PRPs have submitted a joint request for arbitration pursuant to § 304.21 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) If the total past and projected response costs for the facility concerned increase to a dollar amount in excess of $500,000, excluding interest, prior to the rendering of the final decision pursuant to § 304.33 of this part, the parties may mutually agree to continue the proceeding as non-binding arbitration pursuant to the procedures established by this part, except that §§ 304.33(e) and 304.40 of this part shall not apply.</P>

              <P>(2) If all of the parties agree to continue the proceeding as non-binding arbitration, the proposed decision rendered by the Arbitrator pursuant to § 304.33 of this part shall not be binding <PRTPAGE P="371"/>upon the parties, unless all of the parties agree to adopt the proposed decision as an administrative settlement pursuant to section 122(h)(1) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(h)(1). Any administrative settlement agreed upon in this manner shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Attorney General (or his designee) pursuant to section 122(h)(1) of CERCLA and shall be subject to public comment pursuant to section 122(i) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(i).</P>
              <P>(3) If the parties do not agree to continue the proceeding as non-binding arbitration, or if the administrative settlement agreed upon is not approved by the Attorney General (or his designee), or if EPA withdraws or withholds consent from the administrative settlement as a result of public comment, EPA shall withdraw from the proceeding and the Association shall assess or refund, as appropriate, any administrative fees, expenses, or Arbitrator's fees.</P>
              <P>(c) The Arbitrator's authority, as defined by paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, to determine issues arising in EPA's claim is limited only to the issues submitted for resolution by the parties in the joint request for arbitration pursuant to § 304.21 of this part. Any issues arising in EPA's claim that are not submitted for resolution shall be deemed to be not in dispute and shall not be raised in any action seeking enforcement of the decision for the purpose of overturning or otherwise challenging the final decision, except as provided in § 304.40(c) of this part.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) If the issue of liability of any participating PRP has been submitted for resolution, the Arbitrator shall determine whether the participating PRP is liable pursuant to section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), subject only to the defenses specifically enumerated in section 107(b) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(b).</P>
              <P>(2) If the issue of the dollar amount of response costs recoverable by EPA has been submitted for resolution, the Arbitrator shall determine, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the dollar amount of response costs recoverable by EPA pursuant to section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), and shall award the total amount of such costs to EPA.</P>
              <P>(3) Unless the Arbitrator finds that the actual or threatened harm at the facility is divisible, any participating PRP whom the Arbitrator determines to be liable shall be jointly and severally liable for the total amount of response costs awarded to EPA. If the Arbitrator finds that the actual or threatened harm is divisible, the Arbitrator shall allocate liability for payment of EPA's award among the participating PRPs based on the portion of the actual or threatened harm attributable to each participating PRP.</P>
              <P>(4) Notwithstanding the indivisibility of the actual or threatened harm, and without waiving the general applicability of the joint and several liability standard, as an alternative to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the parties may request the Arbitrator to allocate responsibility for payment of response costs awarded to EPA among the participating PRPs whom the Arbitrator determines to be liable. Any such request shall be made in the joint request for arbitration pursuant to § 304.21 of this part. If such a request is made, the provisions of paragraphs (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(ii), and (d)(4)(iii) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(i) The joint request for arbitration may specify the factors to be applied by the arbitrator when allocating among the participating PRPs responsibility for payment of the response costs awarded to EPA. If the joint request does not specify such factors, the Arbitrator shall base the allocation on such factors as the arbitrator considers relevant, in his or her sole discretion, such as volume, toxicity, and mobility of the hazardous substances contributed to the facility by each participating PRP, ability to pay, and inequities and aggravating factors.</P>
              <P>(ii) The joint request for arbitration may specify that the Arbitrator may allocate among the participating PRPs less than all response costs awarded to EPA. If this is not specified, the Arbitrator shall allocate among the participating PRPs 100% of the response costs awarded to EPA.</P>

              <P>(iii) The burden of establishing the appropriate allocation of responsibility for payment of the response costs <PRTPAGE P="372"/>awarded to EPA shall rest entirely with the participating PRPs.</P>
              <P>(5) The parties may request that the Arbitrator perform an allocation even if the issue of the liability of the participating PRPs is not submitted for resolution in the joint request for arbitration. Such a request for allocation shall be made in the joint request for arbitration pursuant to § 304.21 of this part. If such a request is made, the provisions of paragraphs (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(ii), and (d)(4)(iii) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) If any issue concerning the adequacy of EPA's response action has been submitted for resolution or arises during the Arbitrator's determination of the dollar amount of response costs recoverable by EPA, the Arbitrator shall uphold EPA's selection of the response action, unless any participating PRP can establish that the selection was inconsistent with the NCP. The Arbitrator's review of the adequacy of any response action taken by EPA shall be based upon the documents which formed the basis for the selection of the response action.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Arbitrator upholds EPA's selection of the response action in full, the Arbitrator shall award EPA all response costs incurred and to be incurred in connection with the response action, unless any participating PRP can establish that all or part of such costs were:</P>
              <P>(i) Not actually incurred or to be incurred; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Not actually incurred or to be incurred in connection with the response action; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Clearly excessive, taking into account the circumstances of the response action and relative to acceptable government procurement and contracting practices in light of the circumstances of the response action.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Arbitrator upholds EPA's selection of the response action only in part, the Arbitrator shall award EPA only those response costs incurred and to be incurred in connection with the portions of the response action that were upheld, unless any participating PRP can establish that all or part of such response costs were:</P>
              <P>(i) Not actually incurred or to be incurred; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Not actually incurred or to be incurred in connection with the portions of the response action that were upheld; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Clearly excessive, taking into account the circumstances of the response action and relative to acceptable government procurement and contracting practices in light of the circumstances of the response action.</P>
              <P>(4) The standard of review to be applied by the Arbitrator under paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) of this section is arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.</P>
              <P>(5) In reviewing any procedural errors alleged by any party, the Arbitrator may disallow response costs only if the errors were so serious and related to matters of such central relevance that the response action would have been significantly changed had such errors not been made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Referral of claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If EPA believes that a claim is an appropriate candidate for arbitration, EPA will notify all identified PRPs for the facility concerned and provide such PRPs with an opportunity to discuss referral of one or more issues arising in the claim for resolution pursuant to the procedures established by this part. Alternatively, one or more PRPs at a facility may propose to EPA use of arbitration, after receipt of a demand by EPA for payment of a claim, but prior to commencement of civil litigation of the claim. Where practicable, before an agreement to refer a claim for arbitration is made final under this alternative, either the PRPs or EPA shall notify the other PRPs at the facility of the potential use of arbitration.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The Administrator and one or more PRPs associated with a facility may submit to the Association a joint request for arbitration of one or more issues arising in an EPA claim concerning the facility. The joint request shall be signed by all of the parties and shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) A brief description of the facility, the EPA response action taken at the facility, the EPA claim, and the parties;</P>

              <P>(ii) A statement of the issues arising in the claim that are being submitted <PRTPAGE P="373"/>by the parties for resolution by arbitration;</P>
              <P>(iii) A statement that the parties consent to resolution of the issues jointly submitted pursuant to the procedures established by this part by an Arbitrator appointed pursuant to § 304.22 of this part;</P>
              <P>(iv) A statement that the parties agree to be bound by the final decision on all issues jointly submitted by the parties for resolution and to pay any award made in the final decision, subject to the right to challenge the final decision solely on the grounds and in the manner prescribed by § 304.40(c) of this part;</P>
              <P>(v) A statement that the parties agree that the award made in the final decision may be enforced pursuant to § 304.40(c) of this part;</P>
              <P>(vi) A statement that the parties agree that the final decision shall be binding only with respect to the response costs at issue in the claim submitted for arbitration;</P>
              <P>(vii) A statement that the parties agree that the statute of limitations governing the EPA claim submitted shall be extended for a time period equal to the number of days from the date the joint request for arbitration is submitted to the Association to the date of resolution of any enforcement action relating to the final decision; and</P>
              <P>(viii) A statement that each signatory to the joint request is authorized to enter into the arbitration and to bind legally the party represented by him or her to the terms of the joint request.</P>
              <P>(2) The joint request shall also include the name, address and telephone number of each party, and, if a party is represented by an attorney, the attorney's name, address and telephone number. A party changing any of this information must promptly communicate the change in writing to the Association and all other parties. A party who fails to furnish such information or any changes thereto is deemed to have waived his or her right to notice and service under this part until such time as the party furnishes the missing information.</P>
              <P>(c) Any party may move to modify the joint request for arbitration to include one or more additional issues arising in the referred claim. To be effective, any such modification must be signed by the Arbitrator and all other parties. The joint request for arbitration may also be modified to add one or more additional parties, if such intervention is permitted by § 304.24(a) of this part. To be effective, any such modification must be signed by the Arbitrator, the intervening party or parties, and all other parties.</P>
              <P>(d) The statute of limitations governing the EPA claim submitted for arbitration shall be extended for a time period equal to the number of days from the date the joint request for arbitration is submitted to the Association to the date of resolution of any enforcement action relating to the final decision.</P>
              <P>(e) Prior to the selection of the Association, the Administrator and one or more PRPs associated with a facility may agree to submit one or more issues arising in an EPA claim for resolution by arbitration. Any such agreement shall be contained in a joint request for arbitration which meets all requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. In any such arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to § 304.22(e) of this part, and payment of all costs associated with the arbitration shall be made pursuant to § 304.41(e) of this part. Arbitrations agreed upon pursuant to this paragraph shall be governed by the procedures established by this part, except for those procedures which pertain specifically to the duties of the Association. All duties of the Association shall be performed in a manner agreed upon by all of the parties.</P>

              <P>(a) The Association shall establish and maintain a National Panel of Environmental Arbitrators.</P>

              <P>(b) Within ten days of the filing of the joint request for arbitration, the Association shall identify and submit simultaneously to all parties an indentical list of ten persons chosen from the National Panel of Environmental Arbitrators, whom the Association believes will not be subject to disqualification because of circumstances likely to affect impartiality pursuant <PRTPAGE P="374"/>to § 304.23 of this part. Each party shall have ten days from the date of receipt of the list to identify any persons objected to, to rank the remaining persons in the order of preference, and to return the list to the Association. If a party does not return the list within the time specified, all persons on the list are deemed acceptable to that party. From among the persons whom the parties have indicated as acceptable, and, in accordance with the designated order of mutual preference, if any, the Association shall invite an Arbitrator to serve. If the parties fail to mutually agree upon any of the persons named, or if the invited Arbitrator is unable to serve, or if for any other reason the appointment cannot be made from the submitted lists, the Association shall make the appointment from among the other members of the Panel. In no event shall appointment of the Arbitrator by the Association take longer than thirty days from the filing of the joint request for arbitration.</P>
              <P>(c) Within seven days of the appointment of the Arbitrator, the Association shall mail to each of the parties notice of the identity of the Arbitrator and the date of the appointment, together with a copy of these rules. The Arbitrator shall, within five days of his or her appointment, file a signed acceptance of the case with the Association. The Association shall, within seven days of receipt of the Arbitrator's acceptance, mail notice of such acceptance to the parties.</P>
              <P>(d) If any appointed Arbitrator should resign, die, withdraw, be disqualified or otherwise be unable to perform the duties of the office, the Association may, on satisfactory proof, declare the office vacant. Vacancies shall be filled in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section, and the matter shall be resumed.</P>

              <P>(e) If the Administrator and one or more PRPs associated with a facility enter into a joint request for arbitration prior to the selection of the Association (<E T="03">see</E> § 304.21(e) of this part), the Administrator and the participating PRPs shall reach mutual agreement upon the selection and appointment of an Arbitrator on a case-by-case basis, and the Administrator shall obtain the services of that person using appropriate procurement procedures. Any person appointed as an Arbitrator pursuant to this paragraph shall make disclosures to the parties pursuant to § 304.23 of this part, shall resolve the issues submitted for resolution pursuant to the jurisdiction and authority granted to the Arbitrator in § 304.20 of this part, and shall otherwise conduct the arbitral proceeding pursuant to the procedures established by this part.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) No later than thirty days prior to the pre-hearing conference (<E T="03">see</E> § 304.31 of this part), any PRP associated with the facility which is the subject of the referred claim may move to intervene in the arbitral proceeding for <PRTPAGE P="375"/>the purpose of having one or more issues relating to his or her responsibility for payment of the referred claim resolved.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Arbitrator has been appointed, a motion to intervene shall be filed with the Arbitrator and a copy shall be served upon all parties. If the Arbitrator has not yet been appointed, a motion to intervene shall be submitted to the Association and a copy shall be served upon all parties.</P>
              <P>(3) Any such motion to intervene may be granted only upon the written approval of the Arbitrator and all of the parties in the form of a modification to the joint request for arbitration pursuant to § 304.21(c) of this part. by signing such a modification, the intervening party consents to be bound by the terms of the joint request for arbitration submitted pursuant to § 304.21(b) of this part and any modifications previously made thereto pursuant to § 304.21(c) of this part, and consents to be bound by such revisions to the time limits for the filing of pleadings as the Arbitrator may make to prevent delaying the pre-hearing conference.</P>

              <P>(b) Any party may move to withdraw from the arbitral proceeding within thirty days after receipt of the notice of appointment of the Arbitrator (<E T="03">see</E> § 304.22 of this part). The Arbitrator may approve such withdrawal, without prejudice to the moving party, and shall assess such administrative fees and expenses (<E T="03">see</E> § 304.41 of this part) against the withdrawing party as the Arbitrator deems appropriate. No party may withdraw from the arbitral proceedings after this thirty-day period, except that EPA may withdraw from the proceeding in accordance with § 304.20(b)(3) or § 304.33(e) of this part.</P>

The Review Officer shall make the decision of the Agency on the claim in writing and shall serve the Requestor and the Claims Official with a copy of his decision. The Review Officer may, <E T="03">sua sponte,</E> without ruling on the merits of the Request for a Hearing, refer it to the Chief Adminstrative Law Judge for decision.

The Presiding Officer shall conduct a fair and impartial proceeding, assure that the facts are fully elicited, adjudicate all issues, and avoid delay. The Presiding Officer shall have authority to:</P>
              <P>(1) Conduct administrative hearings under this part;</P>

              <P>(3) Administer oaths and affirmations;</P>
              <P>(4) Examine witnesses and receive documentary or other evidence;</P>

              <P>(5) Order a party, or an officer or agent thereof, for good cause, upon motion, or <E T="03">sua sponte,</E> to produce testimony, documents, or other nonprivileged evidence, and failing the production thereof without good cause being shown, draw adverse inferences against that party;</P>

              <P>(12) Do all other acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance of order and for the efficient and impartial adjudication of issues arising in proceedings governed by this part; and</P>
              <P>(13) Resolve all disputes based on the evidence and applicable law; see § 305.31 concerning evidence.</P>

              <P>(c) The Presiding Officer shall notify the parties that the Request for a Hearing has been assigned to him, and that he has received the case file from the Chief Administrative Law Judge. After ruling on any objections to jurisdiction, or final disposition of any objections to disqualification, the Presiding Officer shall render a final order within 90 days after he affirmatively accepts such jurisdiction. The Presiding Officer shall render a final order within the allotted time, unless all parties agree in writing to an extension, or unless, in his discretion, either upon motion of a party or <E T="03">sua sponte,</E> he allows an extension of time not to exceed 60 days. If all parties agree in writing to an extension of the time period within which the Presiding Officer must issue a final order, the extension shall be for the period agreed to in writing by all parties. There are no limits to such periods other than that to which the parties have agreed in writing. An agreement by the parties to extend the time limit does not preclude the Presiding Officer from extending the time limit to issue a final order <E T="03">sua sponte</E> or upon motion of a party, nor does an extension by the Presiding Officer preclude the parties from agreeing to an extension.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disqualification; withdrawal.</E> (1) Neither the Review Officer nor the Presiding Officer may perform functions provided for in this part regarding any matter in which he: has a financial interest; or has any relationship with a party or with the subject matter that would make it inappropriate for him to act. A party shall, by motion presented within 5 days after receiving notice of the assignment of the Presiding Officer, make any objection to his assignment. Otherwise, any objections to the qualifications of the Presiding Officer are waived, unless such objections arise after the time for presenting objections allowed by this paragraph. In such case, any objection must be made within 5 days of the time within which it arose. Either party may appeal the Presiding Officer's ruling on a motion to disqualify him to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall rule on such motion in a timely fashion. When the Chief Administrative Law Judge is the Presiding Officer, he shall refer any challenge to his qualification to hear the case to another Administrative Law Judge for decision. The Review Officer or the Presiding Officer may at any time withdraw from any proceeding in which he deems himself disqualified or unable to act for any reason.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Review Officer or the Presiding Officer is disqualified or withdraws from the proceeding, a qualified individual who has none of the infirmities listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be assigned to replace him. The Administrator shall appoint a new Review Officer. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall assign a new Presiding Officer from among the available Administrative Law Judges.</P>
              <P>(3) The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall have the power to rule on motions for disqualification as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and may, at any stage in the hearing, reassign the case to an Administrative Law Judge other than the one originally assigned in the event of the unavailability of the Administrative Law Judge or where reassignment will result in efficiency in the scheduling of hearings and will not prejudice the parties.</P>

Any motion for a default order shall include a proposed default order and shall be served upon all parties. The alleged defaulting party shall have 10 days from service to reply to the motion. Default by the Claims Official constitutes, for purposes of the pending action only, an admission of all facts alleged in the claim and a waiver of his right to a hearing on such factual allegations. Default by the Requestor may result in the dismissal of the Request for a Hearing with prejudice.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Presiding Officer, upon motion of any party or <E T="03">sua sponte,</E> may at any time render an accelerated order in favor of the Requestor or the Claims Official as to all or any part of <PRTPAGE P="392"/>the proceeding, without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence, such as affidavits, as he may require, if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, as to all or any part of the proceeding. In addition, the Presiding Officer, upon motion of the Claims Official, may at any time dismiss a Request for a Hearing without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence as he requires, on the basis of failure to establish a prima facie case or other grounds which show no right to relief on the part of the Requestor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect.</E> (1) If an accelerated order or an order to dismiss is issued as to all the issues in the proceeding, the order constitutes the final order of the Presiding Officer, and shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk.</P>
              <P>(2) If an accelerated order or an order to dismiss is rendered on less than all issues in the proceeding, the Presiding Officer shall determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts remain controverted in good faith. He shall thereupon issue an interlocutory order specifying the facts which appear substantially uncontroverted, and the issues upon which the hearing will proceed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evidence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Presiding Officer shall admit all evidence which is not irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or otherwise unreliable or of little probative value, except that evidence which would be excluded in the Federal courts under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. appendix) is not admissible. In the presentation, admission, disposition, and use of evidence, the Presiding Officer shall follow the provisions regarding confidential business information of 40 CFR part 2, subpart B for CERCLA. The commercial or trade secret status of any information shall not, however, preclude its being introduced into evidence. The Presiding Officer may make such orders as may be necessary to consider such evidence <E T="03">in camera,</E> including the preparation of a supplemental final order to address questions of law or fact which arise out of that portion of the evidence which is confidential or which includes trade secrets. For the purpose of recording the hearing, the court reporter shall be considered “a person under contract or subcontract to EPA to perform work for EPA in connection with the Act or regulations which implement the Act” pursuant to 40 CFR 2.301(h)(2); unless the affected business, as defined in 40 CFR 2.201(d), agrees to some other procedures approved by the Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Examination of witnesses.</E> Witnesses shall be examined orally, under oath or affirmation, except as otherwise provided in this part or by the Presiding Officer. A party shall have the right to cross-examine a witness who appears at the hearing provided that such cross-examination is not unduly repetitious.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Verified statements.</E> The Presiding Officer may admit and insert into the record as evidence, in lieu of oral testimony, statements of fact or opinions prepared by a witness. The admissibility of the evidence contained in the statement shall be subject to the same rules as if the testimony were produced under oral examination. Before any such statement is read or admitted into evidence, the witness shall deliver <PRTPAGE P="393"/>a copy of the statement to the Presiding Officer, the reporter, and opposing counsel. The witness presenting the statement shall swear to or affirm the statement and shall be subject to appropriate oral cross-examination upon the contents thereof.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Admission of affidavits and other statements where the witness is unavailable.</E> The Presiding Officer may admit into evidence affidavits and other verified written statements of witnesses who are unavailable. The term “unavailable” shall have the meaning accorded to it by rule 804(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Exhibits.</E> Where practicable, an original and one copy of each exhibit shall be filed with the Presiding Officer for the record and copy shall be furnished to each party. A true copy of any exhibit may be substituted for the original.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Official notice.</E> Official notice may be taken of any matter which may be judicially noticed in the Federal courts and of other facts within the specialized knowledge and experience of the Agency. Opposing parties shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.</P>

The party raising the objection must supply a short statement of its grounds. The ruling by the Presiding Officer on any objection and the reasons given for it shall be part of the record. An exception to each objection overruled shall be automatic and is not waived by further participation in the hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Offer of proof.</E> Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering the evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the record. The offer of proof for excluded oral testimony shall consist of a brief statement describing the nature of the evidence excluded. The offer of proof for excluded documents or exhibits shall consist of the insertion into the record of the documents or exhibits excluded.</P>

A certificate of service shall accompany each copy of the transcript. The Hearing Clerk shall notify all the parties of the availability of the transcript and shall furnish the Requestor with a copy of the transcript upon payment of the cost of reproduction, unless a Requestor can show that the cost is unduly burdensome. Any person not a party to the proceeding may receive a copy of the transcript upon payment of the reproduction fee, except for those parts of the transcript ordered to be kept confidential by the Presiding Officer. Any party may file a motion to correct the transcript in accordance with the provision of § 305.23.</P>

The Presiding Officer shall set a time by which reply briefs may be submitted. The Presiding Officer may by order extend the time or change the schedule of such <PRTPAGE P="394"/>submissions or allow further submissions as may be appropriate.

The final order shall contain his findings of fact, conclusions of law, as well as the reasons therefor, and an order for an award for a sum certain, or an explanation of why no award is granted.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Costs.</E> If the Presiding Officer concludes in writing that the Request for a Hearing was frivolous, he may direct the Hearing Clerk to assess all or part of the costs of the proceeding against the Requestor. In such case, the Hearing Clerk shall assess such costs as directed by the Presiding Officer, and shall serve notice of such direction and the amount of such costs on all parties. No later than 5 days after receipt of notice of assessment of costs, the Requestor may move that the Presiding Officer review the assessment of costs by the Hearing Clerk. The Presiding Officer may uphold, reverse, or modify the action of the Hearing Clerk in assessing costs.</P>

              <P>This part prescribes the appropriate forms and procedures for presenting claims for necessary response costs as authorized by section 112(b)(1) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) (herein referred to as CERCLA, or the Act) (42 U.S.C. 9601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Such claims may be presented to the Hazardous Substance Superfund <PRTPAGE P="395"/>(the Fund) established by section 9507 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. See section 101(11) of CERCLA.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 307.11</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Scope and applicability.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The following may be submitted only through the procedures established by this part: claims for responses to a release or substantial threat of release of a hazardous substance into the environment; claims for responses to a release or substantial threat of release of any pollutants or contaminants into the environment, which may present an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare; and claims for response actions undertaken pursuant to settlement agreements in which the Federal Government agrees to reimburse a portion of the cost. Under this part, persons may bring claims for necessary costs incurred in carrying out the National Contingency Plan (NCP) (40 CFR part 300) developed under section 311(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and revised pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA. Only response actions that EPA has preauthorized are eligible for reimbursement through the claims process of section 112 of CERCLA. Authority for the payment of claims for response costs is provided by section 111(a)(2) of CERCLA. Authority for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred by parties to a settlement agreement entered pursuant to section 122 of CERCLA is provided by section 122(b) of CERCLA.</P>
              <P>(b) This part does not affect the terms and conditions contained in Preauthorization Decision Documents (PDDs) issued prior to the effective date of this part. However, a potential claimant may elect to comply with the provisions of this part, rather than the terms and conditions of a PDD issued prior to the effective date of this part, if he so chooses. Written notice of this election must be provided to EPA by the potential claimant prior to such provision taking effect, but not later than the time of the submittal of any claim to EPA. EPA will provide a written acknowledgement of the potential claimant's election and may revise the PDD as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(a) Subject to the provisions of this subpart, claims for the costs of response actions may be asserted against the Fund by any person other than the United States Government, States, and political subdivisions thereof, except to the extent the claimant is otherwise compensated for the loss. States and political subdivisions may assert such claims if they are potentially responsible parties subject to an agreement reached pursuant to section 122(b)(1) of CERCLA.</P>
              <P>(b) Claims presented by an individual must be signed by that individual. If, because of death, disability, or other reasons satisfactory to EPA, the foregoing requirement cannot be fulfilled, the claim may be filed by a duly authorized agent, executor, administrator, or other legal representative. A claim presented by an entity or an authorized agent, executor, administrator, or other legal representative must be presented in the name of the claimant. The claim must be signed by the authorized agent, executor, administrator, or other legal representative (including the title or legal capacity of the person signing) and be accompanied by evidence of the authority to present a claim on behalf of the claimant as authorized agent, executor, administrator, or other legal representative.</P>
              <P>(c) A claim for response costs as to which any release from liability was executed between the claimant and a potentially responsible party may be presented against the Fund to the extent that the claimant obtained EPA's approval prior to executing such release and provided that the other requirements of this part are met.</P>
              <P>(d) A foreign claimant may present a response claim to the Fund, to the same extent that a United States claimant may assert a claim, if:</P>
              <P>(1) The requirements of § 307.21 and § 307.22 are met; and</P>
              <P>(2) The release of a hazardous substance occurred in the navigable waters of the United States, including the territorial sea, or in or on the territorial sea or adjacent shoreline of a foreign country of which the claimant is a resident; and</P>
              <P>(3) The claimant is not otherwise compensated for the loss; and</P>

              <P>(4) The hazardous substance was released from a facility or from a vessel located adjacent to or within the navigable waters or was discharged in connection with activities conducted under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1331 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), or the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and</P>
              <P>(5) Recovery is authorized by a treaty or an executive agreement between the United States and the foreign country involved, or if the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Attorney General and other appropriate officials, certifies that such country provides a comparable remedy for United States claimants.</P>

Claims must be filed in accordance with § 307.22. Claims may be asserted for the costs of removal actions, remedial planning activities, and remedial actions.</P>
              <P>(b) Costs will be considered to be eligible under this section if:</P>
              <P>(1) The response action is preauthorized by EPA pursuant to § 307.22;</P>
              <P>(2) The costs are incurred for activities within the scope of EPA's preauthorization;</P>
              <P>(3) The response action is conducted in a manner consistent with the NCP; and</P>
              <P>(4) The costs incurred are necessary costs pursuant to § 307.11 of this part.</P>

              <P>(1) The contractor claim arose from work within the scope of the contract at issue and the contract was for preauthorized response activities;</P>
              <P>(2) The contractor claim is meritorious;</P>
              <P>(3) The contractor claim was not caused by the mismanagement of the claimant;</P>
              <P>(4) The contractor claim was not caused by the claimant's vicarious liability for the improper actions of others;</P>
              <P>(5) The claimed amount is reasonable and necessary;</P>
              <P>(6) The claim for such costs is filed by the claimant within 5 years of completion of the preauthorized response action; and</P>

              <P>(5) The rationale for the decision.</P>
              <P>(e) Money in the Fund may not be used for paying any claim under this section for expenses incurred for procurement transactions that were not conducted in a manner that provided to the maximum extent practicable, open and free competition; unduly restricted or eliminated competition; and did not provide where applicable for the award of contracts to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder where the selection was made principally on the basis of price.</P>
              <P>(f) Money in the Fund may not be used for paying any claim under this section for expenses incurred by a person operating pursuant to a procurement contract or assistance agreement with the United States.</P>

              <P>(h) Unless EPA waives this requirement prior to the award of a construction contract, money in the Fund may not be used for paying any claim under this section for expenses incurred under such a construction contract that does not contain a “differing site conditions” clause equivalent to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The contractor shall promptly, and before such conditions are disturbed, notify the claimant in writing of:</P>
              <P>(i) Subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site differing materially from those listed in this contract, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Unknown physical conditions at the site, of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in this contract.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon notification by the construction contractor, the claimant shall promptly investigate the conditions. If the claimant finds that conditions materially differ and will cause an increase or decrease in the contractor's cost or the time required to perform any part of the work under its contract, whether or not changed as a result of such conditions, the claimant shall make an equitable adjustment and modify the contract in writing.</P>
              <P>(3) No claim of the contractor under the differing site conditions clause shall be allowed unless the contractor has given the notice required in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. However, the claimant may extend the time prescribed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) No claim by the contractor for an equitable adjustment shall be allowed if asserted after final payment under this contract.</P>
              <P>(i) Where money in the Fund has been used to pay for any response costs under this section, no other claim may be paid out of the Fund for the same costs.</P>

              <P>(9) Whether the party is proposing to conduct a cleanup through an administrative order or a Consent Decree with the Government regarding the site for which the request is made (if the applicant is a potentially responsible party);</P>
              <P>(10) Whether the applicant, if he is a potentially responsible party seeking to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study, has affirmed that he will not directly or indirectly benefit from the preauthorization as a response action contractor, or as a person hired or retained by such a contract with respect to the site at issue, and agrees to reimburse the Fund for any cost incurred under, or in connection with, the oversight contract or arrangement for the remedial investigation and feasibility study;</P>
              <P>(11) Whether the proposed costs are eligible and the applicant has proposed appropriate procurement, contract management, project management, financial management and documentation procedures;</P>

              <P>(13) Provisions for long-term operation and maintenance of the site, if appropriate;</P>

              </P>
              <P>(15) The applicant's proposed procedures for oversight and the reporting of project issues and progress;</P>
              <P>(16) Cooperation of the applicant at any earlier stage of response activity; and</P>
              <P>(17) Whether the proposed schedule for filing a claim(s) is based upon the completion of the project, an operable unit, or a discrete phase of the response work.</P>
              <P>(c) The Administrator may grant preauthorization for all or part of a proposed response action, but not less than a stage of an operable unit or of a response action.</P>
              <P>(1) The Administrator may set a limit on the amount that may be claimed as reimbursement from the Fund for any response action.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may condition the preauthorization on such inspection, monitoring, reporting, safety, and long-term operation and maintenance requirements as he deems necessary. The costs of such requirements may not necessarily be reimbursed from the Fund.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator may condition the preauthorization on such time period for starting and completing the response action as he may deem necessary.</P>
              <P>(4) The Administrator may condition the preauthorization on such financial or other assurance from the claimant or other entity as he may deem necessary to ensure completion of work at the site.</P>
              <P>(5) The Administrator will not subject potentially responsible parties who may wish to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study to a lesser standard of liability nor will he give such parties preferential treatment in EPA's review of applications for preauthorization.</P>
              <P>(d) If EPA denies a preauthorization because of an insufficient balance in the Fund or the low priority assigned to the response action when weighed against other applications or uses of the Fund, the applicant may resubmit the application in another fiscal year. If preauthorization is denied because of the inability of the applicant to demonstrate his experience and capabilities, the applicant may resubmit the application form only after correcting the deficiencies, or by proposing an alternative approach.</P>
              <P>(e) If EPA grants preauthorization, the applicant may begin the approved response action subject to the terms and conditions contained in the PDD. The applicant, as a condition of preauthorization, shall assure that the lead agency shall have such site access as may be necessary for oversight and monitoring.</P>
              <P>(f) If the applicant is unable to initiate or complete the preauthorized response action, the applicant shall immediately notify EPA in writing.</P>
              <P>(g) EPA will not grant preauthorization for any response actions where:</P>
              <P>(1) The proposed action is not a response action authorized under CERCLA;</P>
              <P>(2) There is a significant threat to the public health or the environment caused by acute threat of fire, explosion, direct human contact with a hazardous substance, or other similar hazardous situations requiring immediate action, and there is insufficient time to process an application for preauthorization;</P>
              <P>(3) The proposed response is a remedial action and the site is not on the NPL; or</P>
              <P>(4) The action is to be performed by a State, political subdivision, Indian Tribe through an assistance agreement with the United States, or a person operating pursuant to a contract with the United States.</P>
              <P>(h) EPA will deny preauthorization to a person whom the Agency believes is a liable party under section 107 of CERCLA unless negotiations are underway aimed at reaching a judicial or administrative settlement. Such parties may be preauthorized under this paragraph to submit claims to the Fund for response costs up to the maximum amount specified in the PDD.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requesting payment from the potentially responsible party.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) A claimant must present all claims to any person who is known to the claimant and who may be liable under section 107 of CERCLA at least <PRTPAGE P="404"/>60 days before filing a claim against the Fund. The presentation to the potentially responsible party must be a written request for payment, delivered either by certified mail (return receipt requested) or in such a manner as will establish the date of receipt. At a minimum this request must contain:</P>
              <P>(1) The name of the claimant (commercial entity or individual);</P>
              <P>(2) The name, title, and address of any authorized representative;</P>
              <P>(3) The location of the release and cleanup;</P>
              <P>(4) The date of the release, if known;</P>
              <P>(5) The owner of the property, if other than the claimant;</P>
              <P>(6) A description of the response action taken; and</P>
              <P>(7) The amount of the request (in dollars);</P>
              <P>(8) If applicable, notice of intent to file a subsequent application for preauthorization or claim against the Fund for additional operable units or for a stage of a response action.</P>
              <P>(b) Where the potentially responsible party is unknown, the claimant must make a good-faith effort to identify the potentially responsible party prior to submitting a claim. If the potentially responsible party is identified, the claimant must then comply with the procedures of § 307.30(a). Where a potentially responsible party cannot be identified, the claimant may submit a claim to the Fund pursuant to § 307.31. Claims submitted under this paragraph must be accompanied by documentation of efforts to identify potentially responsible parties.</P>
              <P>(c) If the claimant and the potentially responsible party agree to a settlement involving a release from liability, the claimant may submit a claim against the Fund for any costs that are not recovered provided the claimant complies with the provisions of § 307.20(c), which require EPA's prior approval of such releases from liability.</P>
              <P>(d) If the claim is denied by the potentially responsible party, or has not been satisfied after 60 days of presentation to such party, the claimant may submit a claim to the Fund in accordance with § 307.31.</P>
              <P>(e) If the first claim was denied by the potentially responsible party or not responded to, and EPA agrees that there is no reason to believe that subsequent claims would be honored by such potentially responsible party, the denial of the first claim, or lack of response, shall be considered denial of every subsequent claim.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Filing procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A response claim must be submitted on EPA Form 2075-4 and must include:</P>
              <P>(1) Documentation showing that the claimed response activities were preauthorized by EPA;</P>
              <P>(2) Documentation showing that the response activity was accomplished in a manner consistent with the PDD, noting any deviation from preauthorized activities;</P>
              <P>(3) Documentation that a search to identify potentially responsible parties was conducted in accordance with § 307.30 and of any contacts with such parties; and</P>
              <P>(4) Substantiation that all claimed costs are necessary costs.</P>
              <P>(b) Claimants (or their authorized representatives) may amend their claims at any time before final action by EPA. Amendment of claims after final action by EPA will be allowed only at EPA's discretion. Each amendment must be submitted in writing and must be signed by the claimant or authorized representative. The time limitations of § 307.32(i) refer to the date by which an amendment is filed.</P>
              <P>(c) Claimants may not pursue both an action in court against potentially responsible parties and a claim against the Fund at the same time for the same response costs. EPA will return claims presented under this subpart when the Agency determines that a claimant has initiated an action for recovery of the same response costs, in court, against a party potentially liable under section 107 of CERCLA.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 307.32</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Verification, award, and administrative hearings.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Upon receipt of a response claim, EPA will verify that it complies with all filing requirements. Where the claim is incomplete or has significant defects, EPA will return the claim to the claimant with written notification of its deficiencies.<PRTPAGE P="405"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) A claim returned to the claimant for failure to comply with the filing requirements may be resubmitted to EPA.</P>

              <P>(c) For purposes of this part, a response claim is deemed perfected when EPA determines that the claim complies fully with the specified filing requirements; <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the claim is technically complete. When the claim is perfected, a notice will be provided to the claimant of EPA's receipt and acceptance of the claim for evaluation.</P>
              <P>(d) EPA may adjust claims and in making a determination whether costs are allowable, EPA will be guided by the Federal cost principles (non-profit organizations—OMB Circular A-122; States and political subdivisions—OMB Circular A-87; profit-making organizations—48 CFR part 31, subparts 31.1 and 31.2).</P>
              <P>(e) In evaluating claims, EPA will determine whether the claimant has settled and satisfactorily completed in accordance with sound business judgment and good administrative practice all contractual and administrative matters arising out of agreements to perform preauthorized response actions. This includes the issuance of invitations for bids or requests for proposals, selection of contractors, approval of subcontracts, settlement of protests, claims disputes, and other related procurement matters. EPA will examine how the claimant assured (e.g., by the use of a subcontract administration system) that work was performed in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of such agreements.</P>
              <P>(f) Awards will be made:</P>
              <P>(1) Only for necessary costs of completing the response action or stage of an operable unit or of a response action;</P>
              <P>(2) Only to the extent that the response actions were preauthorized by EPA pursuant to § 307.23;</P>
              <P>(3) Only to the extent that the cleanup was performed effectively, as provided in 40 CFR 300.120(e)(3) and 300.400(h); and</P>
              <P>(4) Only to the extent that the cleanup was performed in compliance with the terms and conditions of the PDD.</P>
              <P>(g) No award will be made on a claim where the claimant has purported to release a potentially responsible party from liability to the United States for the same costs unless EPA has approved the release in advance.</P>
              <P>(h) Where a response action is determined to have been ineffective due to acts or omissions of the claimant, his employees or agents, or any third party having a contractual relationship with the claimant, payment of the claim will be adjusted accordingly. EPA may require the claimant to submit any additional information needed to determine whether the actions taken were reasonable and necessary.</P>
              <P>(i) For claims submitted in connection with a settlement reached under section 122(b)(1) of CERCLA only, interest will be paid on amounts due if EPA fails to pay the amount within 60 days of a perfected claim.</P>
              <P>(1) Interest shall accrue on the amounts due the claimant where EPA fails to pay the claim for the preauthorized response action within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a perfected claim.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the claim is technically complete but EPA requires additional information in order to evaluate the amount claimed, the period as stated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section or the accrual of interest is suspended from the date the Agency requests the information from the claimant until the date the requested information is received.</P>
              <P>(3) Where a claim is denied in whole or in part by EPA, and the claimant requests an administrative hearing in accordance with paragraph (o) of this section, interest on the disputed amount begins to accrue 50 days after an award by the Administrative Law Judge, unless an appeal is filed. If either party files an appeal with a Federal district court, interest will not accrue until 20 days after the final judicial decision.</P>
              <P>(4) The rate of interest paid on a claim is the rate of interest on investments of the Fund established by Subchapter A of Chapter 98 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</P>

              <P>(j) For claims submitted in connection with a settlement reached under section 122(b) of CERCLA, a preauthorized potentially responsible party will be entitled to full reimbursement only where the response action is conducted in complete satisfaction of <PRTPAGE P="406"/>the requirements set forth in the consent order or decree.</P>
              <P>(k) Future site-specific actions required by preauthorized potentially responsible parties, and any future obligations on the Fund, shall be governed by § 307.42.</P>
              <P>(l) Any withdrawal of preauthorization will be preceded by written notice from EPA. The application for preauthorization will be deemed invalid and no award will be made from the Fund where the claimant is determined by EPA to be liable under section 107 of CERCLA for the costs for which the claim is made, and the application for preauthorization did not disclose that the claimant may be a person described as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner and operator of a vessel or a facility;</P>
              <P>(2) Any person, who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance, owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of;</P>
              <P>(3) Any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substance; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance.</P>
              <P>(m) If EPA determines that it cannot complete its evaluation of a claim because of insufficient information, it will request the necessary information from the claimant. If EPA determines that it cannot complete its evaluation of a claim because the records, documents, and other evidence were not maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices consistently applied, or were for any reason inadequate to demonstrate that claimed costs are necessary costs, EPA will adjust the claim accordingly. Further consideration of such amounts will depend on the adequacy of subsequent documentation. Any additional information requested by EPA must be submitted within 30 days, unless a different period of time is specified by EPA. The failure of the claimant to provide in a timely manner the requested information without reasonable cause may be cause for denial of the claim.</P>
              <P>(n) Once the claim is perfected, EPA will proceed to:</P>
              <P>(1) Make an award on the claim; or</P>
              <P>(2) Decline to make an award.</P>
              <P>(o) If the claimant is dissatisfied either with EPA's denial of a claim or with the amount of an award, the claimant may request that EPA arrange an administrative hearing in accordance with section 112(b) of CERCLA. The request for an administrative hearing must occur within 30 days of being notified of EPA's decision.</P>
              <P>(p) Notice of an award under paragraph (f) of this section will be given by First Class Mail within five (5) days of the date of the decision. Payment of approved claims will be made according to § 307.40.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 307.33</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Records retention.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A claimant receiving an award from the Fund is required to maintain all cost documentation and any other records relating to the claim, and to provide EPA with access to such records. These records must be maintained until cost recovery is initiated by EPA. If, after ten (10) years from the date of award of the final claim, EPA has not initiated a cost recovery action, the claimant need no longer retain the records. The claimant shall, however, notify EPA of the location of the records, and allow EPA the opportunity to take possession of the records before they are destroyed. The claimant shall cause to be inserted in all agreements between itself and contractors performing work at the site a clause providing for the same requirement to maintain records and to provide access to records as that required of the claimant.</P>

              <P>(b) Claimants shall assist in any cost recovery action that may be initiated by the United States. The claimant and the claimant's contractors shall furnish the personnel, services, documents, and materials needed to assist EPA in the collection of evidence to document work performed and costs expended by the claimant or the claimant's contractors at the particular site in order to aid in cost recovery efforts. The claimant and the claimant's contractors shall also provide all requested assistance in the interpretation of documents detailing work and costs that may be needed as evidence, and shall testify on behalf of the United States in any judicial or administrative cost recovery proceeding regarding the response costs claimed.

              <P>Sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) of CERCLA authorize the Fund to reimburse certain parties for necessary costs of performing a response action. As is described in more detail at 58 FR 5460, Jan. 21, 1993, 40 CFR part 307, there are two major limitations placed on the payment of claims for response actions. First, only private parties, certain potentially responsible parties (including States and political subdivisions), and certain foreign entities are eligible to file such claims. Second, all response actions under sections 111(a)(2) and 122(b)(1) must receive prior approval, or “preauthorization,” from EPA.</P>

              <P>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) authorizes a number of mechanisms for responding to a release, or threat of release, of hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants. One of these mechanisms is response claims. Section 111(a)(2) of CERCLA authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) to compensate claimants for necessary response costs if certain conditions are met. Section 122(b)(1) of CERCLA authorizes EPA to reimburse certain potentially responsible parties for a portion of the costs of response actions conducted pursuant to a settlement agreement. These conditions are outlined below.</P>
              <P>First, only private parties, parties to section 122(b)(1) agreements (including States and political subdivisions thereof) and foreign entities are eligible for payment through the response claims mechanism. Federal, State, and local government units, and Indian Tribes can receive funding for response activities through other authorities of section 111(a) or section 123 of CERCLA.</P>
              <P>Second, eligible claimants can only be reimbursed for costs that are incurred in carrying out the National Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR part 300. In order to be in conformity with the NCP, all claims must receive prior approval, or “preauthorization,” from EPA. This means that before response work is initiated, the party must:</P>
              <P>(1) Notify EPA of its intent to file a claim;</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the release merits priority consideration;</P>
              <P>(3) Propose activities to remedy the release that can be carried out consistent with the NCP; and</P>
              <P>(4) Demonstrate the capabilities necessary to carry out such activities in a safe and effective manner.</P>
              <FP>In order for potentially responsible parties to be eligible for reimbursement they must conduct the response actions as specified in a Consent Decree or administrative order. Only if EPA preauthorizes a response action can the party begin work, and later file a claim for reimbursement of costs.</FP>
              <P>The limitations placed on the payment of claims for response actions and the procedures for filing such claims are described in more detail at 58 FR 5460, Jan. 21, 1993, 40 CFR part 307. Additional information can be obtained by contacting Phyllis Anderson, Office of Emergency and Remedial Response (5203 G), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, (703) 603-8971, or the RCRA/CERCLA Hotline, (800) 424-9346 (or (703) 920-9810 in the Washington, DC metropolitan area).</P>

                <SUBJECT>What costs are NOT allowable?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Costs that are NOT allowable are expenditures you incur in providing what are traditionally local services and responsibilities. Examples include:</P>
                <P>(1) Routine firefighting;</P>
                <P>(2) Preparing contingency plans;</P>

                <SUBJECT>Do I need to notify anyone while the response is underway?</SUBJECT>

                <P>No. You should notify EPA, the National Response Center, or use another <PRTPAGE P="419"/>established response communication channel, but it is not a requirement for reimbursement. Telephone numbers for EPA regional offices and the NRC are in appendix II to this part.</P>

                <P>Yes. Before applying for reimbursement from EPA, you must try to recover your costs from all known potentially responsible parties (PRPs). After you ask them for payment, you should give PRPs 60 days either to pay you, express their intent to pay you, or indicate willingness to negotiate. You must also try to get reimbursed by other sources (for example, your insurance company or your state). If you are not successful, you must certify on your reimbursement application that you made a good-faith, reasonable effort to recover your costs from other sources before applying to EPA. If you recover any portion of the costs from these sources after you receive reimbursement from us, you must return the recovered amount to EPA.</P>

                <P>(a) You must certify that reimbursement under this regulation does not supplant local funds that you normally provide for emergency response. This means that the reimbursement you request is for costs you would not normally incur; rather, they are for significant, unanticipated costs related to a specific incident beyond what you normally respond to.</P>
                <P>(b) You must also certify that your response actions are not in conflict with CERCLA, the National Contingency Plan (NCP), and the local emergency response plan prepared by your Local Emergency Planning Committee, if there is one. If you need help with this requirement, contact the LGR Help line (800-431-9209) or your EPA regional office.</P>
                <P>(c) You, as a local government, should be included in the local emergency response plan completed by your LEPC, as section 303(a) of EPCRA requires. This does not apply if your State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) has not established an LEPC responsible for the emergency planning district(s) that encompasses your geographic boundaries.</P>

You may also file a request for an exception with your initial application.

                <P>(b) After three years from the date of your reimbursement, if we have NOT begun a cost recovery action against a potentially responsible party, you may dispose of the records.

                <SUBJECT>How will EPA rank approved requests?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If necessary, EPA will rank approved reimbursement requests according to the financial burden the response costs impose on the local governments. We will estimate your financial burden by calculating the ratio of your allowable response costs to your annual per capita income adjusted for population. We will make adjustments for population so that a large city with a low per capita income will not necessarily receive a higher rank than a small town with a slightly higher per capita income. We will also consider other relevant financial information you may supply.</P>

                <P>(b) We will use the per capita income and population statistics published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, in Current Population Reports, Local Population Estimates, Series P-26, “1988 Population and 1987 Per Capita Income Estimates for Counties and Incorporated Places,” Vols. 88-S-SC, 88-ENC-SC, 88-NE-SC, 88-W-SC, 88-WNC-SC, March 1990. The Director of the Federal Register has approved this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part 51. Copies are available from the Bureau of the Census, Office of Public Affairs, Department of Commerce, Constitution Avenue, NE., Washington, DC 20230 (1-202-763-4040).

                </P>
                <P>(c) Larger ratios receive a higher rank. We will reimburse requests with the highest ranks first. Once we rank your request, we will either:</P>
                <P>(1) Reimburse the request; or</P>
                <P>(2) Hold the request for reconsideration once additional funding is available.</P>
                <P>(d) The EPA reimbursement official will give you a written decision on whether the request will be reimbursed or held for future reconsideration.</P>

                <P>(a) You must not knowingly or recklessly make any statement or provide any information in your reimbursement application that is false, misleading, misrepresented, or misstated. If you do provide incorrect or false information, and EPA relies on that information in making a reimbursement decision, we may deny your application and withdraw or recover the full amount of your award.

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix I to Part 310—Frequently Asked Questions</HD>
              <P>(1) Can I be reimbursed for hazmat team salaries?</P>
              <P>Generally, no; only unbudgeted overtime and/or extra time can be considered for reimbursement. (§ 310.11(b)(2))</P>
              <P>(2) Will I be reimbursed for the cost of a destroyed fire truck?</P>
              <P>Up to $25,000 of the cost of a lost fire truck can be considered an allowable cost and therefore, reimbursable. However, if the local government has insurance covering such losses, then we would not reimburse you for a destroyed fire truck. (§§ 310.11(b)(4) and 310.14)</P>
              <P>(3) If I have a release in an elementary school, can the school district apply for reimbursement?</P>

              <P>No, for purposes of the regulation in this part, a school district is considered a special purpose district of local government and therefore not eligible for reimbursement. The county or city where the incident happened may apply for reimbursement on behalf of the school district. (§§ 310.03(e) and 310.05)<PRTPAGE P="422"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Why are incidents that involve a release of petroleum not eligible?</P>
              <P>Because this program is authorized under CERCLA, and petroleum is excluded under CERCLA, we can't reimburse you for response to releases involving only petroleum. If, however, some hazardous substances are also involved, your incident may be reimbursed. (§ 310.03(f))</P>
              <P>(5) Can I be reimbursed for laying water lines to a community whose drinking water is affected by a release?</P>
              <P>No, laying water lines doesn't fall within the definition of temporary emergency measures. Providing bottled water on a temporary emergency basis is reimbursable. (§ 310.10(a))</P>
              <P>(6) What if EPA gets too many applications in one year?</P>
              <P>In the beginning of the program, there was a statutory limitation on the amount of the Superfund that could be used for reimbursements. That limitation was approximately $1,000,000. The limitation has expired, and EPA has only reimbursed slightly over $1,000,000 in ten years. There has not been a year where we received too many applications.</P>
              <P>(7) If I incur significant costs trying to recover from the PRP, can I be reimbursed by EPA for those costs?</P>
              <P>No, legal expenses are not allowable costs. (§ 310.12(b)(7)).</P>
              <P>(8) Can I add attachments to the Application Form?</P>
              <P>Yes, attach any additional information that you feel is necessary. EPA will review all the information that you send.</P>
              <P>(9) Do I have to notify EPA before I send an application in, or before I take a response action?</P>
              <P>No, you aren't required to notify EPA in either case. We do suggest that you call the National Response Center to report the hazardous substance release, or if you use other response reporting channels, use them. If you need some help before submitting your application, we do suggest you call the LGR Help line (800-431-9209).</P>
              <P>(10) If two incidents happen in my town, within hours of each other, do I have to submit two separate applications?</P>
              <P>You aren't required to submit separate applications in this case, but if your total response costs are more than $25,000, it may be in your interest to submit separate applications for each single response. (§ 310.9)</P>

              <P>(b) Persons conducting site characterization and assessments using a grant awarded under CERCLA section 104(k)(2)(B) must include in the inquiries referenced in § 312.27(a) visual inspections of areas where hazardous substances, and may include, as applicable per the terms and conditions of the grant or cooperative agreement, pollutants and contaminants, petroleum and petroleum products, and controlled substances as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802 may be or may have been used, stored, treated, handled or disposed at the subject property and adjoining properties.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as noted in this subsection, a visual on-site inspection of the subject property must be conducted. In the unusual circumstance where an on-site visual inspection of the subject property cannot be performed because of physical limitations, remote and inaccessible location, or other inability to obtain access to the property, provided good faith (as defined in § 312.10) efforts have been taken to obtain such access, an on-site inspection will not be required. The mere refusal of a voluntary seller to provide access to the subject property does not constitute an unusual circumstance. In such unusual circumstances, the inquiry of the environmental professional must include:</P>
              <P>(1) Visually inspecting the subject property via another method (such as aerial imagery for large properties), or visually inspecting the subject property from the nearest accessible vantage point (such as the property line or public road for small properties);</P>
              <P>(2) Documentation of efforts undertaken to obtain access and an explanation of why such efforts were unsuccessful; and</P>
              <P>(3) Documentation of other sources of information regarding releases or threatened releases at the subject property that were consulted in accordance with § 312.20(e). Such documentation should include comments by the environmental professional on the significance of the failure to conduct a visual on-site inspection of the subject property with regard to the ability to identify conditions indicative of releases or threatened releases on, at, in, or to the subject property, if any.</P>

              <P>(2) To assert a claim the submitter shall submit to EPA the following:</P>
              <P>(i) An unsanitized copy of the Tier II emergency and hazardous chemical inventory form under section 312. (The Tier I emergency and hazardous chemical inventory form does not require the reporting of specific chemical identity and therefore no trade secrecy claims may be made with respect to that form.) The submitter shall clearly indicate the specific chemical identity claimed as trade secret by checking the box marked “trade secret” next to the claimed chemical identity.</P>
              <P>(ii) A sanitized copy of the Tier II emergency and hazardous chemical inventory form. This copy shall be identical to the document in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section except that the submitter shall delete the chemical identity or identities claimed as trade secret and include instead the generic class or category of the chemical claimed as trade secret. The method of choosing generic class or category is set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.

              <SUBJECT>Substantiating claims of trade secrecy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Claims of trade secrecy must be substantiated by providing a specific answer including, where applicable, specific facts, to each of the following questions with the submission to which the trade secrecy claim pertains. Submitters must answer these questions on the form entitled “Substantiation to Accompany Claims of Trade Secrecy” in § 350.27 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) Describe the specific measures you have taken to safeguard the confidentiality of the chemical identity claimed as trade secret, and indicate whether these measures will continue in the future.</P>
              <P>(2) Have you disclosed the information claimed as trade secret to any other person (other than a member of a local emergency planning committee, officer or employee of the United States or a State or local government, or your employee) who is not bound by a confidentiality agreement to refrain from disclosing this trade secret information to others?</P>
              <P>(3) List all local, State, and Federal government entities to which you have disclosed the specific chemical identity. For each, indicate whether you asserted a confidentiality claim for the chemical identity and whether the government entity denied that claim.</P>
              <P>(4) In order to show the validity of a trade secrecy claim, you must identify your specific use of the chemical claimed as trade secret and explain why it is a secret of interest to competitors. Therefore:</P>
              <P>(i) Describe the specific use of the chemical claimed as trade secret, identifying the product or process in which it is used. (If you use the chemical other than as a component of a product or in a manufacturing process, identify the activity where the chemical is used.)</P>
              <P>(ii) Has your company or facility identity been linked to the specific chemical identity claimed as trade secret in a patent, or in publications or other information sources available to the public or your competitors (of which you are aware)? If so, explain why this knowledge does not eliminate the justification for trade secrecy.</P>
              <P>(iii) If this use of the chemical claimed as trade secret is unknown outside your company, explain how your competitors could deduce this use from disclosure of the chemical identity together with other information on the Title III submittal form.</P>
              <P>(iv) Explain why your use of the chemical claimed as trade secret would be valuable information to your competitors.</P>
              <P>(5) Indicate the nature of the harm to your competitive position that would likely result from disclosure of the specific chemical identity, and indicate why such harm would be substantial.</P>
              <P>(6)(i) To what extent is the chemical claimed as trade secret available to the public or your competitors in products, articles, or environmental releases?</P>
              <P>(ii) Describe the factors which influence the cost of determining the identity of the chemical claimed as trade secret by chemical analysis of the product, article, or waste which contains the chemical (e.g., whether the chemical is in pure form or is mixed with other substances).</P>
              <P>(b) The answers to the substantiation questions listed in paragraph (a) of this section are to be submitted on the form in § 350.27 of this subpart, and included with a submitter's trade secret claim.</P>
              <P>(c) An owner, operator or senior official with management responsibility shall sign the certification at the end of the form contained in § 350.27. The certification in both the sanitized and unsanitized versions of the substantiation must bear an original signature.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Claims of confidentiality in the substantiation.</E> (1) The submitter may claim as confidential any trade secret or confidential business information contained in the substantiation. Such <PRTPAGE P="443"/>claims for material in the substantiation are not limited to claims of trade secrecy for specific chemical identity, but may also include claims of confidentiality for any confidential business information. To claim this material as confidential, the submitter shall clearly designate those portions of the substantiation to be claimed as confidential by marking those portions “Confidential,” or “Trade Secret.” Information not so marked will be treated as public and may be disclosed without notice to the submitter.</P>
              <P>(2) An owner, operator, or senior official with management responsibility shall sign the certification stating that those portions of the substantiation claimed as confidential would, if disclosed, reveal the chemical identity being claimed as a trade secret, or would reveal other confidential business or trade secret information. This certification is combined on the substantiation form in § 350.27 with the certification described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The submitter shall submit to EPA two copies of the substantiation, one of which shall be the unsanitized version, and the other shall be the sanitized version.</P>
              <P>(i) The unsanitized copy shall contain all of the information claimed as trade secret or business confidential, marked as indicated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The second copy shall be identical to the unsanitized substantiation except that it will be a sanitized version, in which all of the information claimed as trade secret or confidential shall be deleted. If any of the information claimed as trade secret in the substantiation is the chemical identity which is the subject of the substantiation, the submitter shall include the appropriate generic class or category of the chemical claimed as trade secret. This sanitized copy shall be submitted to the State emergency response commission, a designated State agency, the local emergency planning committee and the local fire department, as appropriate, and made publicly available.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Supplemental information.</E> (1) EPA may request supplemental information from the submitter in support of its trade secret claim, pursuant to § 350.11(a)(1). EPA may specify the kind of information to be submitted, or the submitter may submit any additional detailed information which further supports the truth of the information previously supplied to EPA in its initial substantiation, under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The submitter may claim as confidential any trade secret or confidential business information contained in the supplemental information. To claim this material as confidential, the submitter shall clearly designate those portions of the supplemental information to be claimed as confidential by marking those portions “Confidential,” or “Trade Secret.” Information not so marked will be treated as public and may be disclosed without notice to the submitter.</P>
              <P>(3) If portions of the supplementary information are claimed confidential, an owner, operator, or senior official with management responsibility of the submitter shall certify that those portions of the supplemental information claimed as confidential would, if disclosed, reveal the chemical identity being claimed as confidential or would reveal other confidential business or trade secret information.</P>
              <P>(4) If supplemental information is requested by EPA and the submitter claims portions of it as trade secret or confidential, then the submitter shall submit to EPA two copies of the supplemental information, an unsanitized and a sanitized version.</P>
              <P>(i) The unsanitized version shall contain all of the information claimed as trade secret or business confidential, marked as indicated above in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The second copy shall be identical to the unsanitized substantiation except that it will be a sanitized version, in which all of the information claimed as trade secret or confidential shall be deleted. If any of the information claimed as trade secret in the supplemental information is the chemical identity which is the subject of the substantiation, the submitter shall include the appropriate generic class or category of the chemical claimed as trade secret.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Initial action by EPA.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When a claim of trade secrecy, made in accordance with § 350.5 of this part, is received by EPA, that information is treated as confidential until a contrary determination is made.</P>
              <P>(b) A determination as to the validity of a trade secrecy claim shall be initiated upon receipt by EPA of a petition under § 350.15 or may be initiated at any time by EPA if EPA desires to determine whether chemical identity information claimed as trade secret is entitled to trade secret treatment, even though no request for release of the information has been received.</P>
              <P>(c) If EPA initiates a determination as to the validity of a trade secrecy claim, the procedures set forth in §§ 350.11, 350.15, and 350.17 shall be followed in making the determination.</P>
              <P>(d) When EPA receives a petition requesting disclosure of trade secret chemical identity or if EPA decides to initiate a determination of the validity of a trade secrecy claim for chemical identity, EPA shall first make a determination that the chemical identity claimed as trade secret is not the subject of a prior trade secret determination by EPA concerning the same submitter and facility, or if it is, that the prior determination upheld the submitter's claim of trade secrecy for that chemical identity at that facility.</P>
              <P>(1) If EPA determines that the chemical identity claimed as trade secret is not the subject of a prior trade secret determination by EPA concerning the same submitter and the same facility, or if it is, that the prior determination upheld the submitter's claim of trade secrecy, then EPA shall review the submitter's claim according to § 350.1l.</P>
              <P>(2) If such a prior determination held that the submitter's claim for that chemical identity is invalid, and such determination was not challenged by appeal to the General Counsel, or by review in the District Court, or, if challenged, was upheld, EPA shall notify the submitter by certified mail (return receipt requested) that the chemical identity claimed as trade secret is the subject of a prior, final Agency determination concerning the same facility in which it was held that such a claim was invalid. In this notification EPA shall include notice of intent to disclose chemical identity within 10 days pursuant to § 350.18(c) of this subpart. EPA shall also notify the petitioner by regular mail of the action taken pursuant to this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Review of claim.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determination of sufficiency.</E> When EPA receives a petition submitted pursuant to § 350.15, or if EPA initiates a determination of the validity of a trade secrecy claim for chemical identity, and EPA has made a determination, as required in paragraph (d)(1) of § 350.9, then EPA shall determine whether the submitter has presented sufficient support for its claim of trade secrecy in its substantiation. EPA must make such a determination within 30 days of receipt of a petition. A claim of trade secrecy for chemical identity will be considered sufficient if, assuming all of the information presented in the substantiation is true, this supporting information could support a valid claim of trade secrecy. A claim is sufficient if it meets the criteria set forth in § 350.13.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sufficient claim.</E> If the claim meets the criteria of sufficiency set forth in § 350.13, EPA shall notify the submitter in writing, by certified mail (return receipt requested), that it has 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice to submit supplemental information in writing in accordance with § 350.7(e), to support the truth of the facts asserted in the substantiation. EPA will not accept any supplemental information, in response to this notice, submitted after the 30 day period has expired. The notice required by this section shall include the address to which supplemental information must be sent. The notice may specifically request supplemental information in particular areas relating to the submitter's claim. The notice must also inform the submitter of his right to claim any trade secret or confidential business information as confidential, and shall include a reference to § 350.7(e) of this regulation as the source for the proper procedure for claiming trade secrecy for trade secret or confidential business information submitted in the supplemental information requested by EPA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Insufficient claim.</E> If the claim does not meet the criteria of sufficiency set forth in § 350.13, EPA shall notify the <PRTPAGE P="445"/>submitter in writing of this fact by certified mail (return receipt requested). Upon receipt of this notice, the submitter may either file an appeal of the matter to the General Counsel under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or, for good cause shown, submit additional material in support of its claim of trade secrecy to EPA under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. The notice required by this section shall include the reasons for EPA's decision that the submitter's claim is insufficient, and shall inform the submitter of its rights within 30 days of receiving notice to file an appeal with EPA's General Counsel or to amend its original substantiation for good cause shown. The notice shall include the address of the General Counsel, and the address of the office to which an amendment for good cause shown should be sent. The notice shall also include a reference to § 350.11(a)(2)(i)-(iv) of this subpart as the source on the proper procedures for filing an appeal or for amending the original substantiation.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> The submitter may file an appeal of a determination of insufficiency with the General Counsel within 30 days of receipt of the notice of insufficiency, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 350.17.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Good Cause.</E> In lieu of an appeal to the General Counsel, the submitter may send additional material in support of its trade secrecy claim, for good cause shown, within 30 days of receipt of the notice of insufficiency. To do so, the submitter shall notify EPA by letter of its contentions as to good cause, and shall include in that letter the additional supporting material.</P>
              <P>(iii) Good cause is limited to one or more of the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(A) The submitter was not aware of the facts underlying the additional information at the time the substantiation was submitted, and could not reasonably have known the facts at that time; or</P>
              <P>(B) EPA regulations and other EPA guidance did not call for such information at the time the substantiation was submitted; or</P>
              <P>(C) The submitter had made a good faith effort to submit a complete substantiation, but failed to do so due to an inadvertent omission or clerical error.</P>
              <P>(iv) If EPA determines that the submitter has met the standard for good cause, then EPA shall decide, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, whether the submitter's claim meets the Agency's standards of sufficiency set forth in § 350.13.</P>
              <P>(A) If after receipt of additional material for good cause, EPA decides the claim is sufficient, EPA will determine whether the claim presents a valid claim of trade secrecy according to the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) If after receipt of additional material for good cause, EPA decides the claim is insufficient, EPA will notify the submitter by certified mail (return receipt requested) and the submitter may seek review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. The notice required by this paragraph shall include EPA's reasons for its determination, and shall inform the submitter of its right to seek review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. The petitioner shall be notified of EPA's decision by regular mail.</P>
              <P>(v) If EPA determines that the submitter has not met the standard for good cause, then EPA shall notify the submitter by certified mail (return receipt requested). The submitter may seek review of EPA's decision in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. The notice required in this paragraph shall include EPA's reasons for its determination, and shall inform the submitter of its right to seek review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. The petitioner shall be notified of EPA's decision by regular mail.</P>
              <P>(b) Determination of trade secrecy. Once a claim has been determined to be sufficient under paragraph (a) of this section, EPA must decide whether the claim is entitled to trade secrecy.</P>

              <P>(1) If EPA determines that the information submitted in support of the trade secrecy claim is true and that the chemical identity is a trade secret, the petitioner shall be notified by certified mail (return receipt requested) of EPA's determination and may bring an action in U.S. District Court within 30 <PRTPAGE P="446"/>days of receipt of such notice. The notice required in this paragraph shall include the reasons why EPA has determined that the chemical identity is a trade secret and shall inform the petitioner of its right to seek review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of the notice. The submitter shall be notified of EPA's decision by regular mail.</P>
              <P>(2) If EPA decides that the information submitted in support of the trade secrecy claim is not true and that the chemical identity is not a trade secret:</P>
              <P>(i) The submitter shall be notified by certified mail (return receipt requested) of EPA's determination and may appeal to the General Counsel within 30 days of receipt of such notice, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 350.17. The notice required by this paragraph shall include the reasons why EPA has determined that the chemical identity is not a trade secret and shall inform the submitter of its appeal rights to EPA's General Counsel. The notice shall include the address to which an appeal should be sent and the procedure for filing an appeal, as set forth in § 350.17(a) of this subpart. The petitioner shall be notified of EPA's decision by regular mail.</P>
              <P>(ii) The General Counsel shall notify the submitter by certified mail (return receipt requested) of its decision on appeal pursuant to the requirements in § 350.17. The notice required by this paragraph shall include the reasons for EPA's determination. If the General Counsel affirms the decision that the chemical identity is not a trade secret, then the submitter shall have 30 days from the date it receives notice of the General Counsel's decision to bring an action in U.S. District Court. If the General Counsel decides that the chemical identity is a trade secret, then EPA shall follow the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) A substantiation submitted under § 350.7 will be determined to be insufficient to support a claim of trade secrecy unless the answers to the questions in the substantiation submitted under § 350.7 support all of the following conclusions. This substantiation must include, where applicable, specific facts.</P>
              <P>(1) The submitter has not disclosed the information to any other person, other than a member of a local emergency planning committee, an officer or employee of the United States or a State or local government, an employee of such person, or a person who is bound by a confidentiality agreement, and such person has taken reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of such information and intends to continue to take such measures. To support this conclusion, the facts asserted must show all of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The submitter has taken reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the specific chemical identity and will continue to take such measures.</P>
              <P>(ii) The submitter has not disclosed the specific chemical identity to any person who is not bound by an agreement to refrain from disclosing the information.</P>
              <P>(iii) The submitter has not previously disclosed the specific chemical identity to a local, State, or Federal government entity without asserting a confidentiality claim.</P>
              <P>(2) The information is not required to be disclosed, or otherwise made available, to the public under any other Federal or State law.</P>
              <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of such person. To support this conclusion, the facts asserted must show all of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Either:</E> (A) Competitors do not know or the submitter is not aware that competitors know that the chemical whose identity is being claimed trade secret can be used in the fashion that the submitter uses it, and competitors cannot easily duplicate the specific use of this chemical through their own research and development activities; or</P>
              <P>(B) Competitors are not aware or the submitter does not know whether competitors are aware that the submitter is using this chemical in this fashion.</P>

              <P>(ii) The fact that the submitter manufactures, imports or otherwise uses this chemical in a particular fashion is not contained in any publication or <PRTPAGE P="447"/>other information source (of which the submitter is aware) available to competitors or the public.</P>
              <P>(iii) The non-confidential version of the submission under this title does not contain sufficient information to enable competitors to determine the specific chemical identity withheld therefrom.</P>
              <P>(iv) The information referred to in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, is of value to competitors.</P>
              <P>(v) Competitors are likely to use this information to the economic detriment of the submitter and are not precluded from doing so by a United States patent.</P>
              <P>(vi) The resulting harm to submitter's competitive position would be substantial.</P>
              <P>(4) The chemical identity is not readily discoverable through reverse engineering. To support this conclusion, the facts asserted must show that competitors cannot readily discover the specific chemical identity by analysis of the submitter's products or environmental releases.</P>
              <P>(b) The sufficiency of the trade secrecy claim shall be decided entirely upon the information submitted under § 350.7, or § 350.11(a)(2)(ii).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedure for filing appeal.</E> A submitter may appeal an EPA determination under § 350.11(a)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(i), by filing an appeal with the General Counsel. The appeal shall be addressed to: The Office of General Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Mailcode 2310A, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington DC 20460.</P>
              <FP>The appeal shall contain the following:</FP>
              <P>(1) A letter requesting review of the appealed decision; and</P>
              <P>(2) A copy of the letter containing EPA's decision upon which appeal is requested.</P>
              <P>(b) Appeal of determination of insufficient claim.</P>

              <P>(1) Where a submitter appeals a determination by EPA under <PRTPAGE P="448"/>§ 350.11(a)(2)(i) that the trade secrecy claim presents insufficient support for a finding of trade secrecy, the General Counsel shall make one of the following determinations:</P>
              <P>(i) The trade secrecy claim at issue meets the standards of sufficiency set forth in § 350.13; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The trade secrecy claim at issue does not meet the standards of sufficiency set forth in § 350.13.</P>
              <P>(2) If the General Counsel reverses the decision made by the EPA office handling the claim, the claim shall be processed according to § 350.11(a)(1). The General Counsel shall notify the submitter of the determination on appeal in writing, by certified mail (return receipt requested). The appeal determination shall include the date the appeal was received by the General Counsel, a statement of the decision appealed from, a statement of the decision on appeal and the reasons for such decision.</P>
              <P>(3) If the General Counsel upholds the determination of insufficiency made by the EPA office handling the claim, the submitter may seek review in U.S. District Court within 30 days after receipt of notice of the General Counsel's determination. The General Counsel shall notify the submitter of its determination on appeal in writing, by certified mail (return receipt requested). The appeal determination shall include the date the appeal was received by the General Counsel, a statement of the decision appealed from, a statement of the decision on appeal and the reasons for such decision, and a statement of the submitter's right to seek review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of receipt of such notice. The petitioner shall be notified by regular mail.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeal of determination of no trade secret.</E> (1) If a submitter appeals from a determination by EPA under § 350.11(b)(2) that the specific chemical identity at issue is not a trade secret, the General Counsel shall make one of the following determinations:</P>
              <P>(i) The assertions supporting the claim of trade secrecy are true and the chemical identity is a trade secret; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The assertions supporting the claim of trade secrecy are not true and the chemical identity is not a trade secret.</P>
              <P>(2) If the General Counsel reverses the decision made by the EPA office handling the claim, the General Counsel shall notify the submitter of its determination on appeal in writing, by certified mail (return receipt requested).

              <P>(d) EPA shall furnish notice of its intent to release chemical identity claimed as trade secret by sending the following notification to submitters, under the circumstances set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. The notice shall state that EPA will make the chemical identity available to the petitioner and the public on the tenth working day after the date of the submitter's receipt of written notice (or on such later date as the Office of General Counsel may establish), unless the Office of General Counsel has first been notified of the submitter's commencement of an action in Federal court to obtain judicial review of the determination at issue, and to obtain preliminary injunctive relief against disclosure, or, where applicable, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, of commencement of an appeal to the General Counsel. The notice shall further state that if Federal court action is timely commenced, EPA may nonetheless make the information available to the petitioner and the public (in the absence of an order by the court to the contrary), once the court has denied a motion for a preliminary injunction in the action or has otherwise upheld the EPA determination, or, that if Federal court action or appeal to the General Counsel is timely commenced, EPA may nonetheless make the information available to the petitioner and the public whenever it appears to the General Counsel, after reasonable notice to the submitter, that the submitter is not taking appropriate measures to obtain a speedy resolution of the action.</P>

              <P>(i) That the contractor, subcontractor or the grantee and the contractor's, subcontractor's, or grantee's employees shall use the information only for the purpose of carrying out the work required by the contract, subcontract, or grant, and shall refrain from disclosing the information to anyone other than EPA without the prior written approval of each affected submitter or of an EPA legal office, and shall return to EPA all copies of the information (and any abstracts or extracts therefrom) upon request by the EPA program office, whenever the information is no longer required by the contractor, subcontractor or grantee for the performance of the work required under the contract, subcontract or grant, or upon completion of the contract, subcontract or grant;</P>
              <P>(ii) That the contractor, subcontractor or grantee shall obtain a written agreement to honor such terms of the contract or subcontract from each of the contractor's, subcontractor's or grantee's employees who will have access to the information, before such employee is allowed such access; and</P>
              <P>(iii) That the contractor, subcontractor or grantee acknowledges and agrees that the contract, subcontract or grant provisions concerning the use and disclosure of confidential business information are included for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, both EPA and any covered facility having an interest in information concerning it supplied to the contractor, subcontractor or grantee by EPA under the contract or subcontract or grant.</P>

              <P>(3) No information shall be disclosed under this § 350.23(b) until each affected submitter has been furnished notice of the contemplated disclosure by the EPA program office and has been afforded a period found reasonable by that office (not less than 5 working days) to submit its comments. Such notice shall include a description of the information to be disclosed, the identity of the contractor, subcontractor or grantee, the contract, subcontract or grant number, if any, and the purposes to be served by the disclosure.

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Instructions for Completing the EPA Trade Secret Substantiation Form</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">General Information</HD>

              <P>EPA requires that the information requested in a trade secret substantiation be completed using this substantiation form in order to ensure that all facility and chemical identifier information, substantiation questions, and certification statements are completed. Submitter-devised forms will not be accepted. Incomplete substantiations will in all likelihood be found insufficient to support the claim, and the claim will be denied. <E T="03">Moreover, the statute provides that a submitter who fails to provide information required will be subject to a $10,000 fine.</E> For the submitter's own protection, therefore, the EPA form must be used and completed in its entirety.</P>
              <P>The statute for section 322 establishes a two-phase process in which the submitter must do the following:</P>
              <P>1. At the time a report is submitted, the submitter must present a complete set of assertions that (if true) would be sufficient to justify the claim of trade secrecy; and</P>
              <P>2. If the claim is reviewed by EPA, the submitter will be asked to provide additional factual information sufficient to establish the truthfulness of the assertions made at the time the claim was made.</P>
              <P>In making its assertions of trade secrecy, a submitter should provide, where applicable, descriptive factual statements. Conclusory statements of compliance (such as positive or negative restatements of the questions) may not provide EPA with enough information to make a determination and may be found insufficient to support a claim.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">What May Be Withheld</HD>
              <P>Only the specific chemical identity required to be disclosed in sections 303, 311, 312, and 313 submissions may be claimed trade secret on the Title III submittal itself. (Other trade secret or confidential business information included in answer to a question on the substantiation may be claimed trade secret or confidential, as described below.)</P>

              <P>Location information claimed as confidential under section 312(d)(2)(F) should <E T="03">not</E> be sent to EPA; this should only be sent to the SERC, LEPC, and the fire department, as requested.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Sanitized and Unsanitized Copies</HD>

              <P>You must submit this form to EPA in sanitized and unsanitized versions, along with the sanitized and unsanitized copies of the submittal that gives rise to this trade secrecy claim (except for the section 303 submittal, and for MSDSs under section 311). The <E T="03">unsanitized</E> version of this form contains specific chemical identity and CAS number and may contain other trade secret or confidential business information, which should be clearly labeled as such. Failure to claim other information trade secret or confidential will make that information publicly available. In the <E T="03">sanitized</E> version of this form, the specific chemical identity and CAS number must be replaced with the chemical's generic class or category and any other trade secret or confidential business information should be deleted. <E T="03">You should also send sanitized copies of the submittal and this form to relevant State and local authorities.</E>
              </P>
              <P>Each question on this form must be answered. <E T="03">Submitters are encouraged to answer in the space provided.</E> If you need more space to answer a particular question, please use additional sheets. If you use additional sheets, be sure to include the number (and if applicable, the subpart) of the question being answered and write your facility's Dun and Bradstreet Number on the lower right-hand corner of each sheet.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">When the Forms Must be Submitted</HD>
              <P>The sanitized and unsanitized report forms and trade secret substantiations must be submitted to EPA by the normal reporting deadline for that section (e.g., section 313 submissions for any calendar year must be submitted on or before July 1 of the following year).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Where To Send the Trade Secrecy Claim</HD>

              <P>The address to send all trade secrecy claims is posted on the following EPA Program Web sites, <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/<PRTPAGE P="457"/>ceppo</E> and <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/tri.</E> This information can also be obtained by contacting the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Hotline at (800) 424-9346 or (703) 412-9810, TDD (800) 553-7672, <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hotline/.</E>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Packaging of Claim(s)</HD>
              <P>A completed section 322 claim package must include four items, packaged in the following order:</P>
              <P>1. An unsanitized trade secret substantiation form.</P>
              <P>2. A sanitized trade secret substantiation form.</P>
              <P>3. An unsanitized 312 or 313 report (it is not necessary to create an unsanitized section 303 submittal or MSDS for submission under section 311).</P>
              <P>4. A sanitized (public) section 303, 311, 312, or 313 or report.</P>
              <P>It is important to securely fasten together (binder clip or rubber band) each of the reporting forms and substantiations for the particular chemical being claimed trade secret. This process will make it clear that a claim is physically complete when submitted. When submitters submit claims for more than one chemical, EPA requests that the four parts associated with each chemical be assembled as a set and each set for different chemicals be kept separate within the package sent to EPA. Following these guidelines permits the Agency to make the appropriate determinations of trade secrecy, and to make public only those portions of each submittal required to be disclosed.</P>

              <P>b. Definition of trade secret. A trade secret may consist of any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one's business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. It may be a formula for a chemical compound, a process of manufacturing, treating or preserving materials, a pattern for a machine or other device, or a list of customers. It differs from other secret information in a business (see section 759) in that it is not simply information as to single or ephemeral events in the conduct of the business, as, for example, the amount or other terms of a secret bid for a contract or the salary of certain employees, or the security investments made or contemplated, or the date fixed for the announcement of a new policy or for bringing out a new model or the like. A trade secret is a process or device for continuous use in the operation of the business. Generally it relates to the production of goods, as, for example, a machine or formula for the production of an article. It may, however, relate to the sale of goods or to other operations in the business, such as a code for determining discounts, rebates or other concessions in a price list or catalogue, or a list of specialized customers, or a method of bookkeeping or other office management.</P>

              <P>Secrecy. The subject matter of a trade secret must be secret. Matters of public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry cannot be appropriated by one as his secret. Matters which are completely disclosed by the goods which one markets cannot be his secret. Substantially, a trade secret is known only in the particular business in which it is used. It is not requisite that only the proprietor of the business know it. He may, without losing his protection, communicate it to employees involved in its use. He may likewise communicate it to others pledged to secrecy. Others may also know of it independently, as, for example, when they have discovered the process or formula by independent invention and are keeping it secret. Nevertheless, a substantial element of secrecy must exist, so that, except by the use of improper means, there would be difficulty in acquiring the information. An exact definition of a trade secret is not possible. Some factors to be considered in determining whether given information is one's trade secret are: (1) The extent to which the information is known outside of his business; (2) the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in his business; (3) the extent of measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information; (4) the value of the information to him and to his competitors; (5) the amount of effort or <PRTPAGE P="459"/>money expended by him in developing the information; (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others.</P>
              <P>Novelty and prior art. A trade secret may be a device or process which is patentable; but it need not be that. It may be a device or process which is clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which is merely a mechanical improvement that a good mechanic can make. Novelty and invention are not requisite for a trade secret as they are for patentability. These requirements are essential to patentability because a patent protects against unlicensed use of the patented device or process even by one who discovers it properly through independent research. The patent monopoly is a reward to the inventor. But such is not the case with a trade secret. Its protection is not based on a policy of rewarding or otherwise encouraging the development of secret processes or devices. The protection is merely against breach of faith and reprehensible means of learning another's secret. For this limited protection it is not appropriate to require also the kind of novelty and invention which is a requisite of patentability. The nature of the secret is, however, an important factor in determining the kind of relief that is appropriate against one who is subject to liability under the rule stated in this section. Thus, if the secret consists of a device or process which is a novel invention, one who acquires the secret wrongfully is ordinarily enjoined from further use of it and is required to account for the profits derived from his past use. If, on the other hand, the secret consists of mechanical improvements that a good mechanic can make without resort to the secret, the wrongdoer's liability may be limited to damages, and an injunction against future use of the improvements made with the aid of the secret may be inappropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How do I calculate the quantity of an extremely hazardous substance present in mixtures?</SUBJECT>

                <P>If an EHS is present in a mixture in a particular container, determine the quantity (in pounds) of the EHS in that container by multiplying the concentration of the EHS (in weight percent) by the weight (in pounds) of the mixture in the container. If the concentration of an EHS is less than or equal to one percent in the mixture, you do not have to count that EHS. Here is an example calculation:

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>

                  <P>You have 150 pounds of a mixture that contains 20 weight percent of a certain EHS. The quantity of EHS present in the mixture is:

                <SUBJECT>Do I have to aggregate extremely hazardous substances to determine the total quantity present?</SUBJECT>
                <P>You must aggregate (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, add together) the amounts of each EHS at your facility to determine if a TPQ is present. This means that, for a particular EHS, you must determine the total amount present at any one time at your facility by adding together the quantity of pure EHS and the quantity contained in all mixtures, regardless of location, number of containers, or method of storage. You do not have to count an EHS in a mixture if the concentration of that EHS is less than or equal to one percent.</P>

                <P>(a) Use the lower TPQ from Appendices A and B of this part if the solid:</P>
                <P>(1) Is in powdered form and has a particle size less than 100 microns;</P>
                <P>(2) Is in solution;</P>

                <TNOTE>a. This material is a reactive solid. The TPQ does not default to 10,000 pounds for non-powder, non-molten, non-solution form.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>b. The calculated TPQ changed after technical review as described in a technical support document for the final rule, April 22, 1987.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>c. Chemicals added by final rule, April 22, 1987.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>d. Revised TPQ based on new or re-evaluated toxicity data, April 22, 1987.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>e. The TPQ was revised due to calculation error, April 22, 1987.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>f. Chemicals on the original list that do not meet toxicity criteria but because of their acute lethality, high production volume and known risk are considered chemicals of concern (“Other chemicals”), November 17, 1986 and February 15, 1990.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>g. The TPQ was recalculated (September 8, 2003) since it was mistakenly calculated in the April 22, 1987 final rule under the wrong assumption that this chemical is a reactive solid, when in fact it is a liquid. RQ for this chemical was adjusted on September 11, 2006.</TNOTE>

                <TNOTE>a. This material is a reactive solid. The TPQ does not default to 10,000 pounds for non-powder, non-molten, non-solution form.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>b. The calculated TPQ changed after technical review as described in a technical support document for the final rule, April 22, 1987.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>c. Chemicals added by final rule, April 22, 1987.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>d. Revised TPQ based on new or re-evaluated toxicity data, April 22, 1987.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>e. The TPQ was revised due to calculation error, April 22, 1987.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>f. Chemicals on the original list that do not meet toxicity criteria but because of their acute lethality, high production volume and known risk are considered chemicals of concern (“Other chemicals”). (November 17, 1986, and February 15, 1990.)</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>g. The TPQ was recalculated (September 8, 2003) since it was mistakenly calculated in the April 22, 1987, final rule under the wrong assumption that this chemical is a reactive solid, when in fact it is a liquid. RQ for this chemical was adjusted on September 11, 2006.</TNOTE>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this part?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part (40 CFR part 370) establishes reporting requirements for providing the public with important information on the hazardous chemicals in their communities. Reporting raises community awareness of chemical hazards and aids in the development of State and local emergency response plans. The reporting requirements established under this part consist of Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or Safety Data Sheet (SDS) reporting and inventory reporting.</P>
              <P>(b) This part is written in a special format to make it easier to understand the regulatory requirements. Like other Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, this part establishes enforceable legal requirements. Information considered non-binding guidance under EPCRA is indicated in this regulation by the word “note” and a smaller typeface. Such notes are provided for information purposes only and are not considered legally binding under this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 370.10</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Who must comply with the hazardous chemical reporting requirements of this part?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You must comply with the reporting requirements of this part if the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) require your facility to prepare or have available a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) (or Safety Data Sheet (SDS)) for a hazardous chemical and if either of the following conditions is met:</P>
              <P>(1) A hazardous chemical that is an Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) is present at your facility at any one time in an amount equal to or greater than 500 pounds (227 kg—approximately 55 gallons) or the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ), whichever is lower. EHSs and their TPQs are listed in Appendices A and B of 40 CFR part 355.</P>
              <P>(2) A hazardous chemical that is not an EHS is present at your facility at any one time in an amount equal to or greater than the threshold level for that hazardous chemical. Threshold levels for such hazardous chemicals are:</P>
              <P>(i) For any hazardous chemical that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section, the threshold level is 10,000 pounds (or 4,540 kg).</P>

                <P>Tier II information provides State and local officials and the public with specific information on the amounts and locations of hazardous chemicals present at your facility during the previous calendar year. Some states may require you to use a state reporting format including electronic reporting and certification for submitting your hazardous chemical inventory. Contact your state for the specific requirements in that state. Tier II inventory form includes the following data elements:</P>

                <P>(a) Certification. The owner or operator or the officially designated representative of the owner or operator must certify that all information included in the Tier II submission is true, accurate, and complete as follows: “I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information and that based on my inquiry of those individuals responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate, and complete.” This certification must be accompanied by your full name, official title, signature, date signed, and total number of pages in the submission including all Confidential and Non-Confidential Information Sheets and all attachments. All other pages must also contain your signature or signature stamp, the date you signed the certification, and the total number of pages in the submission.

              <SUBJECT>What information can I claim as trade secret or confidential?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Trade secrets.</E> You may be able to withhold the name of a specific chemical when submitting MSDS (or SDS) reporting or inventory reporting information if that chemical name is claimed as a trade secret. The requirements for withholding trade secret information are set forth in EPCRA section 322 and implemented in 40 CFR part 350. If you are withholding the name of a specific chemical as a trade secret in accordance with trade secrecy requirements, you must report the generic class or category that is structurally descriptive of the chemical along with all other required information. You must also submit the withheld information to EPA and must adequately substantiate your claim. A Form for substantiating trade secret claims is available at the Agency Web site at <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/epcra</E>.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Confidential location information.</E> You may request that the SERC or the LEPC not disclose to the public the location of any specific chemical required to be submitted in Tier II information. If you make such a request, the SERC or LEPC must not disclose the location of the specific chemical. If you use the Tier II Form to report your inventory information, you can choose to report confidential location information for a specific chemical on the Confidential Location Information Sheet, which must be attached to the other Tier II information you are reporting. Although you may request that location information with respect to a specific chemical be withheld from the public, you may not withhold this information from the SERC, the LEPC, or the local fire department. The Confidential Location Information Sheet is available on the Agency Web site at <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/epcra</E>.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Thresholds for reporting.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Except as provided in §§ 372.27 and 372.28, the threshold amounts for purposes of reporting under § 372.30 for toxic chemicals are as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) With respect to a toxic chemical manufactured (including imported) or processed at a facility during the following calendar years:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">1987—75,000 pounds of the chemical manufactured or processed for the year.</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">1988—50,000 pounds of the chemical manufactured or processed for the year.</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">1989 and thereafter—25,000 pounds of the chemical manufactured or processed for the year.</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(b) With respect to a chemical otherwise used at a facility, 10,000 pounds of the chemical used for the applicable calendar year.</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to activities involving a toxic chemical at a facility, when more than one threshold applies to the activities, the owner or operator of the facility must report if it exceeds any applicable threshold and must report on all activities at the facility involving the chemical, except as provided in § 372.38.</P>
              <P>(d) When a facility manufactures, processes, or otherwise uses more than one member of a chemical category listed in § 372.65(c), the owner or operator of the facility must report if it exceeds any applicable threshold for the total volume of all the members of the category involved in the applicable activity. Any such report must cover all activities at the facility involving members of the category.</P>
              <P>(e) A facility may process or otherwise use a toxic chemical in a recycle/reuse operation. To determine whether the facility has processed or used more than an applicable threshold of the chemical, the owner or operator of the facility shall count the amount of the chemical added to the recycle/reuse operation during the calendar year. In particular, if the facility starts up such an operation during a calendar year, or in the event that the contents of the whole recycle/reuse operation are replaced in a calendar year, the owner or operator of the facility shall also count the amount of the chemical placed into the system at these times.</P>

              <P>(f) A toxic chemical may be listed in § 372.65 with the notation that only persons who manufacture the chemical, or manufacture it by a certain method, are required to report. In that case, only owners or operators of facilities that manufacture that chemical as described in § 372.65 in excess of the threshold applicable to such manufacture in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 are required to report. In completing the reporting form, the owner or operator is only required to account for the quantity of the chemical so manufactured and releases associated with such manufacturing, but not releases associated with subsequent processing or use of <PRTPAGE P="502"/>the chemical at that facility. Owners and operators of facilities that solely process or use such a chemical are not required to report for that chemical.</P>
              <P>(g) A toxic chemical may be listed in § 372.65 with the notation that it is in a specific form (e.g., fume or dust, solution, or friable) or of a specific color (e.g., yellow or white). In that case, only owners or operators of facilities that manufacture, process, or use that chemical in the form or of the color, specified in § 372.65 in excess of the threshold applicable to such activity in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 are required to report. In completing the reporting form, the owner or operator is only required to account for the quantity of the chemical manufactured, processed, or used in the form or color specified in § 372.65 and for releases associated with the chemical in that form or color. Owners or operators of facilities that solely manufacture, process, or use such a chemical in a form or color other than those specified by § 372.65 are not required to report for that chemical.</P>
              <P>(h) Metal compound categories are listed in § 372.65(c). For purposes of determining whether any of the thresholds specified in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 are met for metal compound category, the owner or operator of a facility must make the threshold determination based on the total amount of all members of the metal compound category manufactured, processed, or used at the facility. In completing the release portion of the reporting form for releases of the metal compounds, the owner or operator is only required to account for the weight of the parent metal released. Any contribution to the mass of the release attributable to other portions of each compound in the category is excluded.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Alternate threshold and certification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, with respect to the manufacture, process, or otherwise use of a toxic chemical, the owner or operator of a facility may apply an alternate threshold of 1 million pounds per year to that chemical if the owner or operator calculates that the facility would have an annual reportable amount of that toxic chemical not exceeding 500 pounds for the combined total quantities released at the facility, disposed within the facility, treated at the facility (as represented by amounts destroyed or converted by treatment processes), recovered at the facility as a result of recycle operations, combusted for the purpose of energy recovery at the facility, and amounts transferred from the facility to off-site locations for the purpose of recycle, energy recovery, treatment, and/or disposal. These volumes correspond to the sum of amounts reportable for data elements on EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1; Rev. 12/4/93) as Part II column B or sections 8.1 (quantity released), 8.2 (quantity used for energy recovery on-site), 8.3 (quantity used for energy recovery off-site), 8.4 (quantity recycled on-site), 8.5 (quantity recycled off-site), 8.6 (quantity treated on-site), and 8.7 (quantity treated off-site).</P>
              <P>(b) If an owner or operator of a facility determines that the owner or operator may apply the alternate reporting threshold specified in paragraph (a) of this section for a specific toxic chemical, the owner or operator is not required to submit a report for that chemical under § 372.30, but must submit a certification statement that contains the information required in § 372.95. The owner or operator of the facility must also keep records as specified in § 372.10(d).</P>
              <P>(c) Threshold determination provisions of § 372.25 and exemptions pertaining to threshold determinations in § 372.38 are applicable to the determination of whether the alternate threshold has been met.</P>

              <P>(d) Each certification statement under this section for activities involving a toxic chemical that occurred during a calendar year at a facility must be submitted to EPA and to the State in which the facility is located on or before July 1 of the next year. If the covered facility is located in Indian country, the facility shall submit the certification statement as described above to EPA and to the official designated by the Tribal Chairperson or <PRTPAGE P="503"/>equivalent elected official of the relevant Indian Tribe, instead of to the State.</P>
              <P>(e) The provisions of this section do not apply to any chemicals listed in § 372.28.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reporting requirements and schedule for reporting.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For each toxic chemical known by the owner or operator to be manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used in excess of an applicable threshold quantity in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 at its covered facility described in § 372.22 for a calendar year, the owner or operator must submit to EPA and to the State in which the facility is located a completed EPA Form R (EPA Form 9350-1), EPA Form A (EPA Form 9350-2), and, for the dioxin and dioxin-like compounds category, EPA Form R Schedule 1 (EPA Form 9350-3) in accordance with the instructions referred to in subpart E of this part. If the covered facility is located in Indian country, the facility shall submit (to the extent applicable) a completed EPA Form R, Form A, and Form R Schedule 1 as described above to EPA and to the official designated by the Tribal Chairperson or equivalent elected official of the relevant Indian Tribe, instead of to the State.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The owner or operator of a covered facility is required to report as described in paragraph (a) of this section on a toxic chemical that the owner or operator knows is present as a component of a mixture or trade name product which the owner or operator receives from another person, if that chemical is imported, processed, or otherwise used by the owner or operator in excess of an applicable threshold quantity in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 at the facility as part of that mixture or trade name product.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator knows that a toxic chemical is present as a component of a mixture or trade name product (i) if the owner or operator knows or has been told the chemical identity or Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number of the chemical and the identity or Number corresponds to an identity or Number in § 372.65, or (ii) if the owner or operator has been told by the supplier of the mixture or trade name product that the mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical subject to section 313 of the Act or this part.</P>

              <P>(3) To determine whether a toxic chemical which is a component of a mixture or trade name product has been imported, processed, or otherwise <PRTPAGE P="505"/>used in excess of an applicable threshold in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 at the facility, the owner or operator shall consider only the portion of the mixture or trade name product that consists of the toxic chemical and that is imported, processed, or otherwise used at the facility, together with any other amounts of the same toxic chemical that the owner or operator manufactures, imports, processes, or otherwise uses at the facility as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity of the toxic chemical and the specific concentration at which it is present in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall determine the weight of the chemical imported, processed, or otherwise used as part of the mixture or trade name product at the facility and shall combine that with the weight of the toxic chemical manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used at the facility other than as part of the mixture or trade name product. After combining these amounts, if the owner or operator determines that the toxic chemical was manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in excess of an applicable threshold in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28, the owner or operator shall report the specific chemical identity and all releases of the toxic chemical on EPA Form R in accordance with the instructions referred to in subpart E of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity of the toxic chemical and does not know the specific concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, but has been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall assume that the toxic chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product at the upper bound concentration, shall determine whether the chemical has been manufactured, processed, or otherwise used at the facility in excess of an applicable threshold as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and shall report as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the owner or operator knows the specific chemical identity of the toxic chemical, does not know the specific concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, has not been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, and has not otherwise developed information on the composition of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, then the owner or operator is not required to factor that chemical in that mixture or trade name product into threshold and release calculations for that chemical.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific chemical identity of the chemical and knows the specific concentration at which it is present in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall determine the weight of the chemical imported, processed, or otherwise used as part of the mixture or trade name product at the facility. Since the owner or operator does not know the specific identity of the toxic chemical, the owner or operator shall make the threshold determination only for the weight of the toxic chemical in the mixture or trade name product. If the owner or operator determines that the toxic chemical was imported, processed, or otherwise used as part of the mixture or trade name product in excess of an applicable threshold in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28, the owner or operator shall report the generic chemical name of the toxic chemical, or a trade name if the generic chemical name is not known, and all releases of the toxic chemical on EPA Form R in accordance with the instructions referred to in subpart E of this part.</P>

              <P>(v) If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific chemical identity of the chemical, and does not know the specific concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, but has been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator shall assume that the toxic chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product at the upper bound concentration, shall determine whether <PRTPAGE P="506"/>the chemical has been imported, processed, or otherwise used at the facility in excess of an applicable threshold as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, and shall report as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the owner or operator has been told that a mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical, does not know the specific chemical identity of the chemical, does not know the specific concentration at which the chemical is present in the mixture or trade name product, including information they have themselves developed, and has not been told the upper bound concentration of the chemical in the mixture or trade name product, the owner or operator is not required to report with respect to that toxic chemical.</P>
              <P>(c) A covered facility may consist of more than one establishment. The owner or operator of such a facility at which a toxic chemical was manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used in excess of an applicable threshold may submit a separate Form R for each establishment or for each group of establishments within the facility to report the activities involving the toxic chemical at each establishment or group of establishments, provided that activities involving that toxic chemical at all the establishments within the covered facility are reported. If each establishment or group of establishments files separate reports then for all other chemicals subject to reporting at that facility they must also submit separate reports. However, an establishment or group of establishments does not have to submit a report for a chemical that is not manufactured (including imported), processed, otherwise used, or released at that establishment or group of establishments.</P>
              <P>(d) Each report under this section for activities involving a toxic chemical that occurred during a calendar year at a covered facility must be submitted on or before July 1 of the next year. The first such report for calendar year 1987 activities must be submitted on or before July 1, 1988.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">De minimis concentrations of a toxic chemical in a mixture.</E> If a toxic chemical is present in a mixture of chemicals at a covered facility and the toxic chemical is in a concentration in the mixture which is below 1 percent of the mixture, or 0.1 percent of the mixture in the case of a toxic chemical which is a carcinogen as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4), a person is not required to consider the quantity of the toxic chemical present in such mixture when determining whether an applicable threshold has been met under § 372.25 or determining the amount of release to be reported under § 372.30. This exemption applies whether the person received the mixture from another person or the person produced the mixture, either by mixing the chemicals involved or by causing a chemical reaction which resulted in the creation of the toxic chemical in the mixture. However, this exemption applies only to the quantity of the toxic chemical present in the mixture. If the toxic chemical is also manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used at the covered facility other than as part of the mixture or in a mixture at higher concentrations, in excess of an applicable threshold quantity set forth in § 372.25, the person is required to report under § 372.30. This exemption does not apply to toxic chemicals listed in § 372.28, except for purposes of § 372.45(d)(1).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Articles.</E> If a toxic chemical is present in an article at a covered facility, a person is not required to consider the quantity of the toxic chemical present in such article when determining whether an applicable threshold has been met under § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 or determining the amount of release to be reported under § 372.30. This exemption applies whether the person received the article from another person or the person produced the article. However, this exemption applies only to the quantity of the <PRTPAGE P="507"/>toxic chemical present in the article. If the toxic chemical is manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used at the covered facility other than as part of the article, in excess of an applicable threshold quantity set forth in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28, the person is required to report under § 372.30. Persons potentially subject to this exemption should carefully review the definitions of <E T="03">article</E> and <E T="03">release</E> in § 372.3. If a release of a toxic chemical occurs as a result of the processing or use of an item at the facility, that item does not meet the definition of <E T="03">article.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Uses.</E> If a toxic chemical is used at a covered facility for a purpose described in this paragraph (c), a person is not required to consider the quantity of the toxic chemical used for such purpose when determining whether an applicable threshold has been met under § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 or determining the amount of releases to be reported under § 372.30. However, this exemption only applies to the quantity of the toxic chemical used for the purpose described in this paragraph (c). If the toxic chemical is also manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used at the covered facility other than as described in this paragraph (c), in excess of an applicable threshold quantity set forth in § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28, the person is required to report under § 372.30.</P>
              <P>(1) Use as a structural component of the facility.</P>
              <P>(2) Use of products for routine janitorial or facility grounds maintenance. Examples include use of janitorial cleaning supplies, fertilizers, and pesticides similar in type or concentration to consumer products.</P>
              <P>(3) Personal use by employees or other persons at the facility of foods, drugs, cosmetics, or other personal items containing toxic chemicals, including supplies of such products within the facility such as in a facility operated cafeteria, store, or infirmary.</P>
              <P>(4) Use of products containing toxic chemicals for the purpose of maintaining motor vehicles operated by the facility.</P>
              <P>(5) Use of toxic chemicals present in process water and non-contact cooling water as drawn from the environment or from municipal sources, or toxic chemicals present in air used either as compressed air or as part of combustion.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Activities in laboratories.</E> If a toxic chemical is manufactured, processed, or used in a laboratory at a covered facility under the supervision of a technically qualified individual as defined in § 720.3(ee) of this title, a person is not required to consider the quantity so manufactured, processed, or used when determining whether an applicable threshold has been met under § 372.25, § 372.27, or § 372.28 or determining the amount of release to be reported under § 372.30. This exemption does not apply in the following cases:</P>
              <P>(1) Specialty chemical production.</P>
              <P>(2) Manufacture, processing, or use of toxic chemicals in pilot plant scale operations.</P>
              <P>(3) Activities conducted outside the laboratory.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Certain owners of leased property.</E> The owner of a covered facility is not subject to reporting under § 372.30 if such owner's only interest in the facility is ownership of the real estate upon which the facility is operated. This exemption applies to owners of facilities such as industrial parks, all or part of which are leased to persons who operate establishments in any SIC code or NAICS code in § 372.23 that is subject to the requirements of this part, where the owner has no other business interest in the operation of the covered facility.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reporting by certain operators of establishments on leased property such as industrial parks.</E> If two or more persons, who do not have any common corporate or business interest (including common ownership or control), operate separate establishments within a single facility, each such person shall treat the establishments it operates as a facility for purposes of this part. The determinations in §§ 372.22 and 372.25 shall be made for those establishments. If any such operator determines that its establishment is a covered facility under § 372.22 and that a toxic chemical has been manufactured (including imported), processed, or otherwise used at the establishment in excess of an applicable threshold in § 372.25, § 372.27, or <PRTPAGE P="508"/>§ 372.28 for a calendar year, the operator shall submit a report in accordance with § 372.30 for the establishment. For purposes of this paragraph (f), a common corporate or business interest includes ownership, partnership, joint ventures, ownership of a controlling interest in one person by the other, or ownership of a controlling interest in both persons by a third person.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notification about toxic chemicals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section and § 372.65, a person who owns or operates a facility or establishment which:</P>
              <P>(1) Is in SIC codes 20 through 39 or a NAICS code that corresponds to SIC codes 20 through 39 as set forth in § 372.23(b),</P>
              <P>(2) Manufactures (including imports) or processes a toxic chemical, and</P>
              <P>(3) Sells or otherwise distributes a mixture or trade name product containing the toxic chemical, to (i) a facility described in § 372.22, or (ii) to a person who in turn may sell or otherwise distributes such mixture or trade name product to a facility described in § 372.22(b), must notify each person to whom the mixture or trade name product is sold or otherwise distributed from the facility or establishment in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The notification required in paragraph (a) of this section shall be in writing and shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement that the mixture or trade name product contains a toxic chemical or chemicals subject to the reporting requirements of section 313 of Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 and 40 CFR part 372.</P>
              <P>(2) The name of each toxic chemical, and the associated Chemical Abstracts Service registry number of each chemical if applicable, as set forth in § 372.65.</P>
              <P>(3) The percent by weight of each toxic chemical in the mixture or trade name product.</P>
              <P>(c) Notification under this section shall be provided as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For a mixture or trade name product containing a toxic chemical listed in § 373.65 with an effective date of January 1, 1987, the person shall provide the written notice described in paragraph (b) of this section to each recipient of the mixture or trade name product with at least the first shipment of each mixture or trade name product to each recipient in each calendar year beginning January 1, 1989.</P>
              <P>(2) For a mixture or trade name product containing a toxic chemical listed in § 372.65 with an effective date of January 1, 1989 or later, the person shall provide the written notice described in paragraph (b) of this section to each recipient of the mixture or trade name product with at least the first shipment of the mixture or trade name product to each recipient in each calendar year beginning with the applicable effective date.</P>

              <P>(3) If a person changes a mixture or trade name product for which notification was previously provided under paragraph (b) of this section by adding a toxic chemical, removing a toxic chemical, or changing the percent by weight of a toxic chemical in the mixture or trade name product, the person <PRTPAGE P="509"/>shall provide each recipient of the changed mixture or trade name product a revised notification reflecting the change with the first shipment of the changed mixture or trade name product to the recipient.</P>
              <P>(4) If a person discovers (i) that a mixture or trade name product previously sold or otherwise distributed to another person during the calendar year of the discovery contains one or more toxic chemicals and (ii), that any notification provided to such other persons in that calendar year for the mixture or trade name product either did not properly identify any of the toxic chemicals or did not accurately present the percent by weight of any of the toxic chemicals in the mixture or trade name product, the person shall provide a new notification to the recipient within 30 days of the discovery which contains the information described in paragraph (b) of this section and identifies the prior shipments of the mixture or product in that calendar year to which the new notification applies.</P>
              <P>(5) If a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) is required to be prepared and distributed for the mixture or trade name product in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1200, the notification must be attached to or otherwise incorporated into such MSDS. When the notification is attached to the MSDS, the notice must contain clear instructions that the notifications must not be detached from the MSDS and that any copying and redistribution of the MSDS shall include copying and redistribution of the notice attached to copies of the MSDS subsequently redistributed.</P>
              <P>(d) Notifications are not required in the following instances:</P>
              <P>(1) If a mixture or trade name product contains no toxic chemical in excess of the applicable de minimis concentration as specified in § 372.38(a).</P>
              <P>(2) If a mixture or trade name product is one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) An <E T="03">article</E> as defined in § 372.3</P>
              <P>(ii) Foods, drugs, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or tobacco products packaged for distribution to the general public.</P>

              <P>(iii) Any consumer product as the term is defined in the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1251 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) packaged for distribution to the general public.</P>
              <P>(e) If the person considers the specific identity of a toxic chemical in a mixture or trade name product to be a trade secret under provisions of 29 CFR 1910.1200, the notice shall contain a generic chemical name that is descriptive of that toxic chemical.</P>
              <P>(f) If the person considers the specific percent by weight composition of a toxic chemical in the mixture or trade name product to be a trade secret under applicable State law or under the Restatement of Torts section 757, comment b, the notice must contain a statement that the chemical is present at a concentration that does not exceed a specified upper bound concentration value. For example, a mixture contains 12 percent of a toxic chemical. However, the supplier considers the specific concentration of the toxic chemical in the product to be a trade secret. The notice would indicate that the toxic chemical is present in the mixture in a concentration of no more than 15 percent by weight. The upper bound value chosen must be no larger than necessary to adequately protect the trade secret.</P>
              <P>(g) A person is not subject to the requirements of this section to the extent the person does not know that the facility or establishment(s) is selling or otherwise distributing a toxic chemical to another person in a mixture or trade name product. However, for purposes of this section, a person has such knowledge if the person receives a notice under this section from a supplier of a mixture or trade name product and the person in turn sells or otherwise distributes that mixture or trade name product to another person.</P>
              <P>(h) If two or more persons, who do not have any common corporate or business interest (including common ownership or control), as described in § 372.38(f), operate separate establishments within a single facility, each such persons shall treat the establishment(s) it operates as a facility for purposes of this section. The determination under paragraph (a) of this section shall be made for those establishments.</P>
