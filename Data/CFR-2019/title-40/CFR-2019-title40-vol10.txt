      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 61.02
              Definitions.
              The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this section as follows:
              
                Act means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.).
              
                Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or his authorized representative.
              
                Alternative method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant which is not a reference method but which has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination of compliance.
              
                Approved permit program means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
              
                Capital expenditure means an expenditure for a physical or operational change to a stationary source which exceeds the product of the applicable “annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage” specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 534 and the stationary source's basis, as defined by section 1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a physical or operational change to a stationary source must not be reduced by any “excluded additions” as defined for stationary sources constructed after December 31, 1981, in IRS Publication 534, as would be done for tax purposes. In addition, “annual asset guideline repair allowance” may be used even though it is excluded for tax purposes in IRS Publication 534.
              
                Commenced means, with respect to the definition of “new source” in section 111(a)(2) of the Act, that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or modification or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or modification.
              
                Compliance schedule means the date or dates by which a source or category of sources is required to comply with the standards of this part and with any steps toward such compliance which are set forth in a waiver of compliance under § 61.11.
              
                Construction means fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected facility.
              
                Effective date is the date of promulgation in the Federal Register of an applicable standard or other regulation under this part.
              
                Existing source means any stationary source which is not a new source.
              
                Force majeure means, for purposes of § 61.13, an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying with the regulatory requirement to conduct performance tests within the specified timeframe despite the affected facility's best efforts to fulfill the obligation. Examples of such events are acts of nature, acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility.
              
                Issuance of a part 70 permit will occur, if the State is the permitting authority, in accordance with the requirements of part 70 of this chapter and the applicable, approved State permit program. When the EPA is the permitting authority, issuance of a title V permit occurs immediately after the EPA takes final action on the final permit.
              
                Monitoring system means any system, required under the monitoring sections in applicable subparts, used to sample and condition (if applicable), to analyze, and to provide a record of emissions or process parameters.

                of proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants which will be applicable to such source.
              
                Owner or operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a stationary source.
              
                Part 70 permit means any permit issued, renewed, or revised pursuant to part 70 of this chapter.
              
                Permit program means a comprehensive State operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661) and regulations codified in part 70 of this chapter and applicable State regulations, or a comprehensive Federal operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act and regulations codified in this chapter.
              
                Permitting authority means:
              (1) The State air pollution control agency, local agency, other State agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator to carry out a permit program under part 70 of this chapter; or
              (2) The Administrator, in the case of EPA-implemented permit programs under title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).

                Run means the net period of time during which an emission sample is collected. Unless otherwise specified, a run may be either intermittent or continuous within the limits of good engineering practice.
              
                Standard means a national emission standard including a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard for a hazardous air pollutant proposed or promulgated under this part.
              
                Startup means the setting in operation of a stationary source for any purpose.
              
                State means all non-Federal authorities, including local agencies, interstate associations, and State-wide programs, that have delegated authority to implement:
              (1) The provisions of this part; and/or
              (2) The permit program established under part 70 of this chapter. The term State shall have its conventional meaning where clear from the context.
              
                Stationary source means any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant which has been designated as hazardous by the Administrator.
              
                Title V permit means any permit issued, renewed, or revised pursuant to Federal or State regulations established to implement title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661). A title V permit issued by a State permitting authority is called a part 70 permit in this part.

              Application for approval of construction or modification.
              (a) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator an application for approval of the construction of any new source or modification of any existing source. The application shall be submitted before the construction or modification is planned to commence, or within 30 days after the effective date if the construction or modification had commenced before the effective date and initial startup has not occurred. A separate application shall be submitted for each stationary source.
              (b) Each application for approval of construction shall include—
              (1) The name and address of the applicant;
              (2) The location or proposed location of the source; and
              (3) Technical information describing the proposed nature, size, design, operating design capacity, and method of operation of the source, including a description of any equipment to be used for control of emissions. Such technical information shall include calculations of emission estimates in sufficient detail to permit assessment of the validity of the calculations.
              (c) Each application for approval of modification shall include, in addition to the information required in paragraph (b) of this section—
              (1) The precise nature of the proposed changes;
              (2) The productive capacity of the source before and after the changes are completed; and
              (3) Calculations of estimates of emissions before and after the changes are completed, in sufficient detail to permit assessment of the validity of the calculations.

              § 61.08
              Approval of construction or modification.
              (a) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of approval or intention to deny approval of construction or modification within 60 days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate an application under § 61.07.

              (b) If the Administrator determines that a stationary source for which an application under § 61.07 was submitted will not cause emissions in violation of a standard if properly operated, the Administrator will approve the construction or modification.
              
              (c) Before denying any application for approval of construction or modification, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial together with—
              (1) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
              (2) Notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, within such time limit as the Administrator shall specify, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before final action on the application.
              (d) A final determination to deny any application for approval will be in writing and will specify the grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 60 days of presentation of additional information or arguments, or 60 days after the final date specified for presentation if no presentation is made.
              (e) Neither the submission of an application for approval nor the Administrator's approval of construction or modification shall—
              (1) Relieve an owner or operator of legal responsibility for compliance with any applicable provisions of this part or of any other applicable Federal, State, or local requirement; or
              (2) Prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing this part or taking any other action under the Act.

              (a) The owner or operator of each existing source or each new source which had an initial startup before the effective date shall provide the following information in writing to the Administrator within 90 days after the effective date:
              (1) Name and address of the owner or operator.
              (2) The location of the source.
              (3) The type of hazardous pollutants emitted by the stationary source.
              (4) A brief description of the nature, size, design, and method of operation of the stationary source including the operating design capacity of the source. Identify each point of emission for each hazardous pollutant.
              (5) The average weight per month of the hazardous materials being processed by the source, over the last 12 months preceding the date of the report.
              (6) A description of the existing control equipment for each emission point including—
              (i) Each control device for each hazardous pollutant; and
              (ii) Estimated control efficiency (percent) for each control device.
              (7) A statement by the owner or operator of the source as to whether the source can comply with the standards within 90 days after the effective date.
              (b) The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with an applicable standard may request a waiver of compliance with that standard for a period not exceeding 2 years after the effective date. Any request shall be in writing and shall include the following information:
              (1) A description of the controls to be installed to comply with the standard.
              (2) A compliance schedule, including the date each step toward compliance will be reached. The list shall include as a minimum the following dates:

              (i) Date by which contracts for emission control systems or process changes for emission control will be awarded, or date by which orders will be issued for the purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control or process changes;
              (ii) Date of initiation of onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process change;
              (iii) Date by which onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process change is to be completed; and
              (iv) Date by which final compliance is to be achieved.
              (3) A description of interim emission control steps which will be taken during the waiver period.
              (c) Any change in the information provided under paragraph (a) of this section or § 61.07(b) shall be provided to the Administrator within 30 days after the change. However, if any change will result from modification of the source, §§ 61.07(c) and 61.08 apply.
              (d) A possible format for reporting under this section is included as appendix A of this part. Advice on reporting the status of compliance may be obtained from the Administrator.
              (e) For the purposes of this part, time periods specified in days shall be measured in calendar days, even if the word “calendar” is absent, unless otherwise specified in an applicable requirement.
              (f) For the purposes of this part, if an explicit postmark deadline is not specified in an applicable requirement for the submittal of a notification, application, report, or other written communication to the Administrator, the owner or operator shall postmark the submittal on or before the number of days specified in the applicable requirement. For example, if a notification must be submitted 15 days before a particular event is scheduled to take place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days preceding the event; likewise, if a notification must be submitted 15 days after a particular event takes place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days following the end of the event. The use of reliable non-Government mail carriers that provide indications of verifiable delivery of information required to be submitted to the Administrator, similar to the postmark provided by the U.S. Postal Service, or alternative means of delivery agreed to by the permitting authority, is acceptable.
              (g) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
              (h) If an owner or operator of a stationary source in a State with delegated authority is required to submit reports under this part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the submission of reports that is consistent with the reporting frequency(ies) specified for such source under this part, the owner or operator may change the dates by which reports under this part shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the State. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

              (i) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary sources affected by standards set under this part and standards set under part 60, part 63, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a common schedule on which reports required by each applicable standard shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part, or 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable part 60 or part 63 standard, whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
              (j)(1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
              (ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for in paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section each time he or she wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline specified in this part.
              (2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
              (3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request.
              (4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.

              Waiver of compliance.
              (a) Based on the information provided in any request under § 61.10, or other information, the Administrator may grant a waiver of compliance with a standard for a period not exceeding 2 years after the effective date of the standard.
              (b) The waiver will be in writing and will—
              (1) Identify the stationary source covered;
              (2) Specify the termination date of the waiver;
              (3) Specify dates by which steps toward compliance are to be taken; and
              (4) Specify any additional conditions which the Administrator determines necessary to assure installation of the necessary controls within the waiver period and to assure protection of the health of persons during the waiver period.
              (c) The Administrator may terminate the waiver at an earlier date than specified if any specification under paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section are not met.
              (d) Before denying any request for a waiver, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator making the request of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with—
              (1) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
              (2) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present, within the time limit the Administrator specifies, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before final action on the request.
              (e) A final determination to deny any request for a waiver will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 60 days after presentation of additional information or argument; or within 60 days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
              (f) The granting of a waiver under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Act.

              § 61.12
              Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.
              (a) Compliance with numerical emission limits shall be determined in accordance with emission tests established in § 61.13 or as otherwise specified in an individual subpart.
              (b) Compliance with design, equipment, work practice or operational standards shall be determined as specified in an individual subpart.
              (c) The owner or operator of each stationary source shall maintain and operate the source, including associated equipment for air pollution control, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the source.

              (d)(1) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of a pollutant from a source at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of that pollutant from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with the standard. The notice will restrict the permission to the source(s) or category(ies) of sources on which the alternative means will achieve equivalent emission reductions. The notice may condition permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
              (2) Any notice under paragraph (d)(1) shall be published only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
              (3) Any person seeking permission under this subsection shall, unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, submit a proposed test plan or the results of testing and monitoring, a description of the procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring.
              (e) For the purpose of submitting compliance certifications or establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any standard in this part, nothing in this part shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed.

              § 61.13
              Emission tests and waiver of emission tests.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section, if required to do emission testing by an applicable subpart and unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under this section, the owner or operator shall test emissions from the source:
              (1) Within 90 days after the effective date, for an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date before the effective date.
              (2) Within 90 days after initial startup, for a new source which has an initial startup date after the effective date.
              (3) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section or beyond a deadline established pursuant to the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.

              (4) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.
              (5) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.
              (6) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
              (b) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to test emissions from the source at any other time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.
              (c) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the emission test at least 30 days before the emission test to allow the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.
              (d) If required to do emission testing, the owner or operator of each new source and, at the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of each existing source shall provide emission testing facilities as follows:
              (1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to each source.
              (2) Safe sampling platform(s).
              (3) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
              (4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
              (5) Any other facilities that the Administrator needs to safely and properly test a source.
              (e) Each emission test shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify based on design and operational characteristics of the source.

              (1) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.

              (i) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60 of this chapter; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix A-4 of part 60; Method 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60; Methods 30A and 30B of appendix A-8 of part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request, and the compliance authority may grant, a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.
              (ii) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
              (A) Preparing the sample;
              
              (B) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;
              (C) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;
              (D) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;
              (E) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;
              (F) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;
              (G) Reporting the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and to the source owner, operator, or representative by the AASP. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.
              (H) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in consultation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed;
              (I) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.
              (iii) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit or samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
              (A) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP.
              (B) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years.
              (C) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.

              (iv) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm. The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.
              
              (2) [Reserved]
              (f) Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart, samples shall be analyzed and emissions determined within 30 days after each emission test has been completed. The owner or operator shall report the determinations of the emission test to the Administrator by a registered letter sent before the close of business on the 31st day following the completion of the emission test.
              (g) The owner or operator shall retain at the source and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 years, records of emission test results and other data needed to determine emissions.
              (h)(1) Emission tests shall be conducted as set forth in this section, the applicable subpart and appendix B unless the Administrator—
              (i) Specifies or approves the use of a reference method with minor changes in methodology; or
              (ii) Approves the use of an alternative method; or
              (iii) Waives the requirement for emission testing because the owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the source is in compliance with the standard.
              (2) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail.
              (3) The owner or operator may request approval for the use of an alternative method at any time, except—
              (i) For an existing source or a new source that had an initial startup before the effective date, any request for use of an alternative method during the initial emission test shall be submitted to the Administrator within 30 days after the effective date, or with the request for a waiver of compliance if one is submitted under § 60.10(b); or
              (ii) For a new source that has an initial startup after the effective date, any request for use of an alternative method during the initial emission test shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than with the notification of anticipated startup required under § 60.09.
              (i)(1) Emission tests may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the standard, or the source is being operated under a waiver or compliance, or the owner or operator has requested a waiver of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
              (2) If application for waiver of the emission test is made, the application shall accompany the information required by § 61.10 or the notification of startup required by § 61.09, whichever is applicable. A possible format is contained in appendix A to this part.
              (3) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later cancelling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the source.

              § 61.14
              Monitoring requirements.
              (a) Unless otherwise specified, this section applies to each monitoring system required under each subpart which requires monitoring.

              (b) Each owner or operator shall maintain and operate each monitoring system as specified in the applicable subpart and in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Any unavoidable breakdown or malfunction of the monitoring system should be repaired or adjusted as soon as practicable after its occurrence. The Administrator's determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information which may include, but not be limited to, review of operating and maintenance procedures, manufacturer recommendations and specifications, and inspection of the monitoring system.
              (c) When required by the applicable subpart, and at any other time the Administrator may require, the owner or operator of a source being monitored shall conduct a performance evaluation of the monitoring system and furnish the Administrator with a copy of a written report of the results within 60 days of the evaluation. Such a performance evaluation shall be conducted according to the applicable specifications and procedures described in the applicable subpart. The owner or operator of the source shall furnish the Administrator with written notification of the date of the performance evaluation at least 30 days before the evaluation is to begin.
              (d) When the effluents from a single source, or from two or more sources subject to the same emission standards, are combined before being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall install a monitoring system on each effluent or on the combined effluent. If two or more sources are not subject to the same emission standards, the owner or operator shall install a separate monitoring system on each effluent, unless otherwise specified. If the applicable standard is a mass emission standard and the effluent from one source is released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the owner or operator shall install a monitoring system at each emission point unless the installation of fewer systems is approved by the Administrator.
              (e) The owner or operator of each monitoring system shall reduce the monitoring data as specified in each applicable subpart. Monitoring data recorded during periods of unavoidable monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments shall not be included in any data average.
              (f) The owner or operator shall maintain records of monitoring data, monitoring system calibration checks, and the occurrence and duration of any period during which the monitoring system is malfunctioning or inoperative. These records shall be maintained at the source for a minimum of 2 years and made available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator.
              (g)(1) Monitoring shall be conducted as set forth in this section and the applicable subpart unless the Administrator—
              (i) Specifies or approves the use of the specified monitoring requirements and procedures with minor changes in methodology; or
              (ii) Approves the use of alternatives to any monitoring requirements or procedures.
              (2) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator may require the monitoring requirements and procedures specified in this part.

              § 61.15
              Modification.
              (a) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, any physical or operational change to a stationary source which results in an increase in the rate of emission to the atmosphere of a hazardous pollutant to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification.
              (b) Upon modification, an existing source shall become a new source for each hazardous pollutant for which the rate of emission to the atmosphere increases and to which a standard applies.
              (c) Emission rate shall be expressed as kg/hr of any hazardous pollutant discharged into the atmosphere for which a standard is applicable. The Administrator shall use the following to determine the emission rate:

              (1) Emission factors as specified in the background information document (BID) for the applicable standard, or in the latest issue of “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,” EPA Publication No. AP-42, or other emission factors determined by the Administrator to be superior to AP-42 emission factors, in cases where use of emission factors demonstrates that the emission rate will clearly increase or clearly not increase as a result of the physical or operational change.
              
              (2) Material balances, monitoring data, or manual emission tests in cases where use of emission factors, as referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, does not demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the emission rate will clearly increase or clearly not increase as a result of the physical or operational change, or where an interested person demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds to dispute the result obtained by the Administrator using emission factors. When the emission rate is based on results from manual emission tests or monitoring data, the procedures specified in appendix C of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine whether an increase in emission rate has occurred. Tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to the owner or operator. At least three test runs must be conducted before and at least three after the physical or operational change. If the Administrator approves, the results of the emission tests required in § 61.13(a) may be used for the test runs to be conducted before the physical or operational change. All operating parameters which may affect emissions must be held constant to the maximum degree feasible for all test runs.
              (d) The following shall not, by themselves, be considered modifications under this part:
              (1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement which the Administrator determines to be routine for a source category.
              (2) An increase in production rate of a stationary source, if that increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on the stationary source.
              (3) An increase in the hours of operation.
              (4) Any conversion to coal that meets the requirements specified in section 111(a)(8) of the Act.
              (5) The relocation or change in ownership of a stationary source. However, such activities must be reported in accordance with § 61.10(c).

              (a) Emissions to the atmosphere from stationary sources subject to the provisions of this subpart shall not exceed 10 grams (0.022 lb) of beryllium over a 24-hour period, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

              (b) Rather than meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may request approval from the Administrator to meet an ambient concentration limit on beryllium in the vicinity of the stationary source of 0.01 µg/m 3 (4.37 × 10−6 gr/ft 3), averaged over a 30-day period.
              (1) Approval of such requests may be granted by the Administrator provided that:

              (i) At least 3 years of data is available which in the judgment of the Administrator demonstrates that the future ambient concentrations of beryllium in the vicinity of the stationary source will not exceed 0.01 µg/m 3 (4.37 × 10−6 gr/ft 3), averaged over a 30-day period. Such 3-year period shall be the 3 years ending 30 days before the effective date of this standard.

              (h) A description of data and procedures (methods or models) used to design the air sampling network (i.e., number and location of sampling sites).
              (i) Air sampling data indicating beryllium concentrations in the vicinity of the stationary source for the 3-year period specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This data shall be presented chronologically and include the beryllium concentration and location of each individual sample taken by the network and the corresponding 30-day average beryllium concentrations.
              (2) Within 60 days after receiving such report, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing whether approval is granted or denied. Prior to denying approval to comply with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will consult with representatives of the statutory source for which the demonstration report was submitted.
              (c) The burning of beryllium and/or beryllium-containing waste, except propellants, is prohibited except in incinerators, emissions from which must comply with the standard.

              Stack sampling.

              (a) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under § 61.13, each owner or operator required to comply with § 61.32(a) shall test emissions from the source according to Method 104 of appendix B to this part or according to Method 29 of appendix A to part 60. Method 103 of appendix B to this part is approved by the Administrator as an alternative method for sources subject to § 61.32(a). The emission test shall be performed:
              (1) By May 28, 2014 in the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding February 27, 2014; or
              (2) Within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source which did not have an initial startup date preceding February 27, 2014.
              (b) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test so that he may at his option observe the test.
              (c) Samples shall be taken over such a period or periods as are necessary to accurately determine the maximum emissions which will occur in any 24-hour period. Where emissions depend upon the relative frequency of operation of different types of processes, operating hours, operating capacities, or other factors, the calculation of maximum 24-hour-period emissions will be based on that combination of factors which is likely to occur during the subject period and which result in the maximum emissions. No changes in the operation shall be made, which would potentially increase emissions above that determined by the most recent source test, until a new emission level has been estimated by calculation and the results reported to the Administrator.
              (d) All samples shall be analyzed and beryllium emissions shall be determined within 30 days after the source test. All determinations shall be reported to the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched before the close of the next business day following such determination.
              (e) Records of emission test results and other data needed to determine total emissions shall be retained at the source and made available, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 years.

Parameter excursions will be considered unacceptable operation and maintenance of the emission control system. In addition, while compliance with the emission limits is determined primarily by conducting a performance test according to the procedures in § 61.53(b), reports of parameter excursions may be used as evidence in judging the duration of a violation that is determined by a performance test.
              (8) Semiannual reports required in paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator on September 15 and March 15 of each year. The first semiannual report is to be submitted following the first full 6 month reporting period. The semiannual report due on September 15 (March 15) shall include all excursions monitored through August 31 (February 28) of the same calendar year.
              (c) As an alternative to the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in paragraphs (b)(2) through (8) of this section, an owner or operator may develop and submit for the Administrator's review and approval a plant-specific monitoring plan. To be approved, such a plan must ensure not only compliance with the emission limits of § 61.52(a) but also proper operation and maintenance of emissions control systems. Any site-specific monitoring plan submitted must, at a minimum, include the following:
              (1) Identification of the critical parameter or parameters for the hydrogen stream and for the end-box ventilation stream that are to be monitored and an explanation of why the critical parameter(s) selected is the best indicator of proper control system performance and of mercury emission rates.
              (2) Identification of the maximum or minimum value of each parameter (e.g., degrees temperature, concentration of mercury) that is not to be exceeded. The level(s) is to be directly correlated to the results of a performance test, conducted no more than 180 days prior to submittal of the plan, when the facility was in compliance with the emission limits of § 61.52(a).
              (3) Designation of the frequency for recording the parameter measurements, with justification if the frequency is less than hourly. A longer recording frequency must be justified on the basis of the amount of time that could elapse during periods of process or control system upsets before the emission limits would be exceeded, and consideration is to be given to the time that would be necessary to repair the failure.
              (4) Designation of the immediate actions to be taken in the event of an excursion beyond the value of the parameter established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (5) Provisions for reporting, semiannually, parameter excursions and the corrective actions taken, and provisions for reporting within 10 days any significant excursion.
              (6) Identification of the accuracy of the monitoring device(s) or of the readings obtained.
              (7) Recordkeeping requirements for certifications and calibrations.
              (d) Mercury cell chlor-alkali plants—cell room ventilation system. (1) Stationary sources determining cell room emissions in accordance with § 61.53(c)(4) shall maintain daily records of all leaks or spills of mercury. The records shall indicate the amount, location, time, and date the leaks or spills occurred, identify the cause of the leak or spill, state the immediate steps taken to minimize mercury emissions and steps taken to prevent future occurrences, and provide the time and date on which corrective steps were taken.
              (2) The results of monitoring shall be recorded, retained at the source, and made available for inspection by the Administrator for a minimum of 2 years.

              Delegation of authority.
              (a) In delegating implementation and enforcement authority to a State under section 112(d) of the Act, the authorities contained in paragraph (b) of this section shall be retained by the Administrator and not transferred to a State.
              (b) Authorities which will not be delegated to States: Sections 61.53(c)(4) and 61.55(d). The authorities not delegated to States listed are in addition to the authorities in the General Provisions, subpart A of 40 CFR part 61, that will not be delegated to States (§§ 61.04(b), 61.12(d)(1), and 61.13(h)(1)(ii)).

This requirement does not apply to prepolymerization reactors in the bulk process. This requirement does apply to postpolymerization reactors in the bulk process, where the product means the gross product of prepolymerization and postpolymerization.
              (3) Manual vent valve discharge. Except for an emergency manual vent valve discharge, there is to be no discharge to the atmosphere from any manual vent valve on a polyvinyl chloride reactor in vinyl chloride service. An emergency manual vent valve discharge means a discharge to the atmosphere which could not have been avoided by taking measures to prevent the discharge. Within 10 days of any discharge to the atmosphere from any manual vent valve, the owner or operator of the source from which the discharge occurs shall submit to the Administrator a report in writing containing information on the source, nature and cause of the discharge, the date and time of the discharge, the approximate total vinyl chloride loss during the discharge, the method used for determining the vinyl chloride loss (the calculation of the vinyl chloride loss), the action that was taken to prevent the discharge, and measures adopted to prevent future discharges.

              § 61.65
              Emission standard for ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride and polyvinyl chloride plants.
              An owner or operator of an ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride, and/or polyvinyl chloride plant shall comply with the requirements of this section.
              (a) Relief valve discharge (RVD). Except for an emergency relief discharge, and except as provided in § 61.65(d), there is to be no discharge to the atmosphere from any relief valve on any equipment in vinyl chloride service. An emergency relief discharge means a discharge which could not have been avoided by taking measures to prevent the discharge. Within 10 days of any relief valve discharge, except for those subject to § 61.65(d), the owner or operator of the source from which the relief valve discharge occurs shall submit to the Administrator a report in writing containing information on the source, nature and cause of the discharge, the date and time of the discharge, the approximate total vinyl chloride loss during the discharge, the method used for determining the vinyl chloride loss (the calculation of the vinyl chloride loss), the action that was taken to prevent the discharge, and measures adopted to prevent future discharges.
              (b) Fugitive emission sources—(1) Loading and unloading lines. Vinyl chloride emissions from loading and unloading lines in vinyl chloride service which are opened to the atmosphere after each loading or unloading operation are to be minimized as follows:
              (i) After each loading or unloading operation and before opening a loading or unloading line to the atmosphere, the quantity of vinyl chloride in all parts of each loading or unloading line that are to be opened to the atmosphere is to be reduced so that the parts combined contain no greater than 0.0038 m 3 (0.13 ft 3) of vinyl chloride, at standard temperature and pressure; and
              (ii) Any vinyl chloride removed from a loading or unloading line in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is to be ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period), or equivalent as provided in § 61.66.
              (2) Slip gauges. During loading or unloading operations, the vinyl chloride emissions from each slip gauge in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by ducting any vinyl chloride discharged from the slip gauge through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period), or equivalent as provided in § 61.66.
              (3) Leakage from pump, compressor, and agitator seals:
              (i) Rotating pumps. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on all rotating pumps in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by installing sealless pumps, pumps with double mechanical seals or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. If double mechanical seals are used, vinyl chloride emissions from the seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure between the two seals so that any leak that occurs is into the pump; by ducting any vinyl chloride between the two seals through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. Compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V demonstrates compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
              (ii) Reciprocating pumps. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on all reciprocating pumps in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by installing double outboard seals, or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. If double outboard seals are used, vinyl chloride emissions from the seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure between the two seals so that any leak that occurs is into the pump; by ducting any vinyl chloride between the two seals through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. Compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V demonstrates compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
              (iii) Rotating compressor. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on all rotating compressors in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by installing compressors with double mechanical seals, or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. If double mechanical seals are used, vinyl chloride emissions from the seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure between the two seals so that any leak that occurs is into the compressor; by ducting any vinyl chloride between the two seals through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. Compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V demonstrates compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
              (iv) Reciprocating compressors. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on all reciprocating compressors in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by installing double outboard seals, or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. If double outboard seals are used, vinyl chloride emissions from the seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure between the two seals so that any leak that occurs is into the compressor; by ducting any vinyl chloride between the two seals through a control system from which concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. Compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V demonstrates compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
              (v) Agitator. Vinyl chloride emissions from seals on all agitators in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized by installing agitators with double mechanical seals, or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. If double mechanical seals are used, vinyl chloride emissions from the seals are to be minimized by maintaining the pressure between the two seals so that any leak that occurs is into the agitated vessel; by ducting any vinyl chloride between the two seals through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm; or equivalent as provided in § 61.66.
              (4) Leaks from relief valves. Vinyl chloride emissions due to leaks from each relief valve on equipment in vinyl chloride service shall comply with § 61.242-4 of subpart V of this part.
              (5) Manual venting of gases. Except as provided in § 61.64(a)(3), all gases which are manually vented from equipment in vinly chloride service are to be ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period); or equivalent as provided in § 61.66.
              (6) Opening of equipment. Vinyl chloride emissions from opening of equipment (excluding crude, intermediate, and final EDC storage tanks, but including prepolymerization reactors used in the manufacture of bulk resins and loading or unloading lines that are not opened to the atmosphere after each loading or unloading operation) are to be minimized follows:
              (i) Before opening any equipment for any reason, the quantity of vinyl chloride which is contained therein is to be reduced to an amount which occupies a volume of no more than 2.0 percent of the equipment's containment volume or 0.0950 cubic meters (25 gallons), whichever is larger, at standard temperature and pressure.
              (ii) Any vinyl chloride removed from the equipment in accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section is to be ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period); or equivalent as provided in § 61.66.
              (7) Samples. Unused portions of samples containing at least 10 percent by weight vinyl chloride are to be returned to the process or destroyed in a control device from which concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gas does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period) or equivalent as provided in § 61.66. Sampling techniques are to be such that sample containers in vinyl chloride service are purged into a closed process system. Compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 61 subpart V demonstrates compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.
              (8) Leak detection and elimination. Vinyl chloride emissions due to leaks from equipment in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized as follows:
              (i) A reliable and accurate vinyl chloride monitoring system shall be operated for detection of major leaks and identification of the general area of the plant where a leak is located. A vinyl chloride monitoring system means a device which obtains air samples from one or more points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples with gas chromatography or, if the owner or operator assumes that all hydrocarbons measured are vinyl chloride, with infrared spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an equivalent or alternative method. The vinyl chloride monitoring system shall be operated according to a program developed by the plant owner or operator. The owner or operator shall submit a description of the program to the Administrator within 45 days of the effective date of these regulations, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11, or the program has been approved and the Administrator does not request a review of the program. Approval of a program will be granted by the Administrator provided he finds:
              (A) The location and number of points to be monitored and the frequency of monitoring provided for in the program are acceptable when they are compared with the number of pieces of equipment in vinyl chloride service and size and physical layout of the plant.
              (B) It contains a definition of leak which is acceptable when compared with the background concentrations of vinyl chloride in the areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring system. Measurements of background concentrations of vinyl chloride in the areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring system are to be included with the description of the program. The definition of leak for a given plant may vary among the different areas within the plant and is also to change over time as background concentrations in the plant are reduced.
              (C) It contains an acceptable plan of action to be taken when a leak is detected.
              (D) It provides for an acceptable calibration and maintenance schedule for the vinyl chloride monitoring system and portable hydrocarbon detector. For the vinyl chloride monitoring system, a daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride equal to the concentration defined as a leak according to paragraph (b)(8)(i)(B) of this section. The calibration is to be done with either:
              (1) A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 and in accordance with section 10.1 of Method 106, or
              (2) A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration gas cylinder standard is to have been certified by the manufacturer. The manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. The date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf life must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas chromatograph is used as the vinyl chloride monitoring system, these gas mixtures may be directly used to prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Sections 8.1 and 9.2 of Method 106. The requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 of Method 106 for certification of cylinder standards and for establishment and verification of calibration standards are to be followed.

              (ii) For each process unit subject to this subpart, a formal leak detection and repair program shall be implemented consistent with subpart V of this part, except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section. This program is to be implemented within 90 days of the effective date of these regulations, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(E) of this section, an owner or operator shall be exempt from § 61.242-1(d), § 61.242-7 (a), (b), and (c), § 61.246, and § 61.247 of subpart V of this part for any process unit in which the percentage of leaking valves is demonstrated to be less than 2.0 percent, as determined in accordance with the following:
              (A) A performance test as specified in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B) of this section shall be conducted initially within 90 days of the effective date of these regulations, annually, and at times requested by the Administrator.
              (B) For each performance test, a minimum of 200 or 90 percent, whichever is less, of the total valves in VOC service (as defined in § 60.481 of subpart VV of part 60) within the process unit shall be randomly selected and monitored within 1 week by the methods specified in § 61.245(b) of this part. If an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured, a leak is detected. The leak percentage shall be determined by dividing the number of valves in VOC service for which leaks are detected by the number of tested valves in VOC service.
              (C) If a leak is detected, it shall be repaired in accordance with § 61.242-7 (d) and (e) of subpart V of this part.
              (D) The results of the performance test shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator in the first quarterly report following the performance test as part of the reporting requirements of § 61.70.
              (E) Any process unit in which the percentage of leaking valves is found to be greater than 2.0 percent according to the performance test prescribed in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B) of this section must comply with all provisions of subpart V of this part within 90 days.
              (iii) Open-ended valves or lines located on multiple service process lines which operate in vinyl chloride service less than 10 percent of the time are exempt from the requirements of § 61.242-6 of subpart V, provided the open-ended valves or lines are addressed in the monitoring system required by paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section. The Administrator may apply this exemption to other existing open-ended valves or lines that are demonstrated to require significant retrofit cost to comply with the requirements of § 61.242-6 of subpart V.
              (9) Inprocess wastewater. Vinyl chloride emissions to the atmosphere from inprocess wastewater are to be reduced as follows:
              (i) The concentration of vinyl chloride in each inprocess wastewater stream containing greater than 10 ppm vinyl chloride measured immediately as it leaves a piece of equipment and before being mixed with any other inprocess wastewater stream is to be reduced to no more than 10 ppm by weight before being mixed with any other inprocess wastewater stream which contains less than 10 ppm vinyl chloride; before being exposed to the atmosphere; before being discharged to a wastewater treatment process; or before being discharged untreated as a wastewater. This paragraph does apply to water which is used to displace vinyl chloride from equipment before it is opened to the atmosphere in accordance with § 61.64(a)(2) or paragraph (b)(6) of this section, but does not apply to water which is used to wash out equipment after the equipment has already been opened to the atmosphere in accordance with § 61.64(a)(2) or paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
              (ii) Any vinyl chloride removed from the inprocess wastewater in accordance with paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section is to be ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period); or equivalent as provided in § 61.66.

              (c) The requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section are to be incorporated into a standard operating procedure, and made available upon request for inspection by the Administrator. The standard operating procedure is to include provisions for measuring the vinyl chloride in equipment 4.75 m3 (1255 gal) in volume for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.65(b)(6)(i) after opening the equipment and using Method 106, a portable hydrocarbon detector, or an alternative method. The method of measurement is to meet the requirements in § 61.67(g)(5)(i)(A) or (g)(5)(i)(B).
              (d) A RVD that is ducted to a control device that is continually operating while emissions from the release are present at the device is subject to the following requirements:
              (1) A discharge from a control device other than a flare shall not exceed 10 ppm (average over a 3-hour period) as determined by the continuous emission monitor system required under § 61.68. Such a discharge is subject to the requirements of § 61.70.
              (2) For a discharge routed to a flare, the flare shall comply with the requirements of § 60.18.
              (i) Flare operations shall be monitored in accordance with the requirements of §§ 60.18(d) and 60.18(f)(2). For the purposes of § 60.18(d), the volume and component concentration of each relief valve discharge shall be estimated and calculation shall be made to verify ongoing compliance with the design and operating requirements of §§ 60.18 (c)(3) through (c)(6). If more than one relief valve is discharged simultaneously to a single flare, these calculations shall account for the cumulative effect of all such relief valve discharges. These calculations shall be made and reported quarterly for all discharges within the quarter. Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this paragraph will be a violation of § 61.65(d)(2). Monitoring for the presence of a flare pilot flame shall be conducted in accordance with § 60.18(f)(2). If the results of this monitoring or any other information shows that the pilot flame is not present 100 percent of the time during which a relief valve discharge is routed to the flare, the relief valve discharge is subject to the provisions of § 61.65(a).
              (ii) A report describing the flare design shall be provided to the Administrator not later than 90 days after the adoption of this provision or within 30 days of the installation of a flare system for control of relief valve discharge whichever is later. The flare design report shall include calculations based upon expected relief valve discharge component concentrations and net heating values (for PVC this calculation shall be based on values expected if a release occurred at the instant the polymerization starts); and estimated maximum exit velocities based upon the design throat capacity of the gas in the relief valve.

              Equivalent equipment and procedures.
              Upon written application from an owner or operator, the Administrator may approve use of equipment or procedures which have been demonstrated to his satisfaction to be equivalent in terms of reducing vinyl chloride emissions to the atmosphere to those prescribed for compliance with a specific paragraph of this subpart.

              § 61.67
              Emission tests.
              (a) Unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under § 61.13, the owner or operator of a source to which this subpart applies shall test emissions from the source,
              (1) Within 90 days of the effective date in the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the effective date, or
              (2) Within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source, initial startup of which occurs after the effective date.
              (b) The owner or operator shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of an emission test to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.
              (c) Any emission test is to be conducted while the equipment being tested is operating at the maximum production rate at which the equipment will be operated and under other relevant conditions as may be specified by the Administrator based on representative performance of the source.
              (d) [Reserved]

              (e) When at all possible, each sample is to be analyzed within 24 hours, but in no case in excess of 72 hours of sample collection. Vinyl chloride emissions are to be determined within 30 days after the emission test. The owner or operator shall report the determinations to the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched before the close of the next business day following the determination.
              (f) The owner or operator shall retain at the plant and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 3 years, records of emission test results and other data needed to determine emissions.
              (g) Unless otherwise specified, the owner or operator shall use the test methods in appendix B to this part for each test as required by paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), (g)(4), and (g)(5) of this section, unless an alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn. Whenever Method 107 is specified, and the conditions in Section 1.2, “Applicability” of Method 107A are met, Method 107A may be used.
              (1) Method 106 is to be used to determine the vinyl chloride emissions from any source for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.62(a) or (b), § 61.63(a), or § 61.64(a)(1), (b), (c), or (d), or from any control system to which reactor emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.65(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), or (b)(9)(ii).

              (i) For each run, one sample is to be collected. The sampling site is to be at least two stack or duct diameters downstream and one half diameter upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, contraction, or visible flame. For a rectangular cross section, an equivalent diameter is to be determined from the following equation:
              
              Equivalent diameter = 2(length)(width)/(length + width)
              
              The sampling point in the duct is to be at the centroid of the cross section. The sample is to be extracted at a rate proportional to the gas velocity at the sampling point. The sample is to contain a minimum volume of 50 liters (1.8 ft3) corrected to standard conditions and is to be taken over a period as close to 1 hour as practicable.
              (ii) Each emission test is to consist of three runs. For the purpose of determining emissions, the average of results of all runs is to apply. The average is to be computed on a time weighted basis.
              (iii) For gas streams containing more that 10 percent oxygen, the concentration of vinyl chloride as determined by Method 106 is to be corrected to 10 percent oxygen (dry basis) for determination of emissions by using the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.474
              
              
                Where:
                
                Cb(corrected) = The concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases, corrected to 10 percent oxygen.
                Cb = The concentration of vinyl chloride as measured by Method 106.

                10.9 = Percent oxygen in the ambient air at standard conditions, minus the 10.0 percent oxygen to which the correction is being made.
                Percent O2 = Percent oxygen in the exhaust gas as measured by Method 3 of appendix A of part 60 of this chapter.
              
              
              (iv) For those emission sources where the emission limit is prescribed in terms of mass rather than concentration, mass emissions are to be determined using the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.475
              
              
                Where:

              (2) Method 107 or Method 601 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 61.18) is to be used to determine the concentration of vinyl chloride in each inprocess wastewater stream for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.65(b)(9)(i).
              (3) When a stripping operation is used to attain the emission limits in § 61.64(e) and (f), emissions are to be determined using Method 107 as follows:
              (i) The number of strippers (or reactors used as strippers) and samples and the types and grades of resin to be sampled are to be determined by the Administrator for each individual plant at the time of the test based on the plant's operation.
              (ii) Each sample is to be taken immediately following the stripping operation.
              (iii) The corresponding quantity of material processed by each stripper (or reactor used as a stripper) is to be determined on a dry solids basis and by a method submitted to and approved by the Administrator.
              (iv) At the prior request of the Administrator, the owner or operator shall provide duplicates of the samples required in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.
              (4) Where control technology other than or in addition to a stripping operation is used to attain the emission limit in § 61.64(e), emissions are to be determined as follows:
              (i) Method 106 is to be used to determine atmospheric emissions from all of the process equipment simultaneously. The requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section are to be met.
              (ii) Method 107 is to be used to determine the concentration of vinyl chloride in each inprocess wastewater stream subject to the emission limit prescribed in § 61.64(e). Vinyl chloride mass emissions are to be determined using the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.476
              
              
                Where:

                K = Unit conversion factor, 1,000 g/kg (1 lb/lb).
                10−6 = Conversion factor for ppm.
                Z = Production rate, kg/hr (lb/hr), determined in accordance with a method which has been submitted to and approved by the Administrator.
              
              
              (5) The reactor opening loss for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.64(a)(2) is to be determined. The number of reactors for which the determination is to be made is to be specified by the Administrator for each individual plant at the time of the determination based on the plant's operation.
              (i) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, the reactor opening loss is to be determined using the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.477

              (A) If Method 106 is used to determine the concentration of vinyl chloride (Cb), the sample is to be withdrawn at a constant rate with a probe of sufficient length to reach the vessel bottom from the manhole. Samples are to be taken for 5 minutes within 6 inches of the vessel bottom, 5 minutes near the vessel center, and 5 minutes near the vessel top.
              

              (B) If a portable hydrocarbon detector is used to determine the concentration of vinyl chloride (Cb), a probe of sufficient length to reach the vessel bottom from the manhole is to be used to make the measurements. One measurement will be made within 6 inches of the vessel bottom, one near the vessel center and one near the vessel top. Measurements are to be made at each location until the reading is stabilized. All hydrocarbons measured are to be assumed to be vinyl chloride.
              (C) The production rate of polyvinyl chloride (Z), which is the product of the average batch weight and the number of batches produced since the reactor was last opened to the atmosphere, is to be determined by a method submitted to and approved by the Administrator.
              (ii) A calculation based on the number of evacuations, the vacuum involved, and the volume of gas in the reactor is hereby approved by the Administrator as an alternative method for determining reactor opening loss for postpolymerization reactors in the manufacture of bulk resins. Calculation methods based on techniques other than repeated evacuation of the reactor may be approved by the Administrator for determining reactor opening loss for postpolymerization reactors in the manufacture of bulk resins.
              (6) For a reactor that is used as a stripper, the emissions of vinyl chloride from reactor opening loss and all sources following the reactor used as a stripper for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.64(f) are to be determined. The number of reactors for which the determination is to be made is to be specified by the Administrator for each individual plant at the time of the determination based on the plant's operation.
              (i) For each batch stripped in the reactor, the following measurements are to be made:

              (B) The reactor vacuum at end of strip from plant instrument; and
              (C) The reactor temperature at the end of strip from plant instrument.
              (ii) For each batch stripped in the reactor, the following information is to be determined:

              (h)(1) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably contain equipment in vinyl chloride service is presumed to be in vinyl chloride service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in vinyl chloride service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in vinyl chloride service, it must be determined that the percent vinyl chloride content can be reasonably expected not to exceed 10 percent by weight for liquid streams or contained liquid volumes and 10 percent by volume for gas streams or contained gas volumes, which also includes gas volumes above liquid streams or contained liquid volumes. For purposes of determining the percent vinyl chloride content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, procedures that conform to the methods described in ASTM D2267-68, 78, or 88 or D4420-94 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 61.18) shall be used.
              (2)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section to demonstrate that the percent vinyl chloride content does not exceed 10 percent by weight for liquid streams and 10 percent by volume for gas streams, provided that the engineering judgment demonstrates that the vinyl chloride content clearly does not exceed 10 percent. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in vinyl chloride service, however, the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
              (ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in vinyl chloride service, the determination can be revised only after following the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
              (3) Samples used in determining the percent vinyl chloride content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.

              § 61.68
              Emission monitoring.
              (a) A vinyl chloride monitoring system is to be used to monitor on a continuous basis the emissions from the sources for which emission limits are prescribed in §§ 61.62 (a) and (b), 61.63(a), and 61.64 (a)(1), (b), (c), and (d), and for any control system to which reactor emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.65 (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6) (ii), and (b)(9)(ii).
              (b) The vinyl chloride monitoring system(s) used to meet the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section is to be a device which obtains representative samples from one or more applicable emission points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples with gas chromatography or, if the owner or operator assumes that all hydrocarbons measured are vinyl chloride, with infrared spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an alternative method. The vinyl chloride monitoring system used to meet the requirements in § 61.65(b)(8)(i) may be used to meet the requirements of this section.
              (c) A daily span check is to be conducted for each vinyl chloride monitoring system used. For all of the emission sources listed in paragraph (a) of this section, except the one for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.62(b), the daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride equal to 10 ppm. For the emission source for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.62(b), the daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride which is determined to be equivalent to the emission limit for that source based on the emission test required by § 61.67. The calibration is to be done with either:

              (1) A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 and in accordance with Section 10.1 of Method 106, or
              
              (2) A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration gas cylinder standard is to have been certified by the manufacturer. The manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. The date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration and recommended maximum shelf life must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas chromatograph is used as the vinyl chloride monitoring system, these gas mixtures may be directly used to prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Sections 8.1 and 9.2 of Method 106. The requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 of Method 106 for certification of cylinder standards and for establishment and verification of calibration standards are to be followed.
              (d) When exhaust gas(es), having emission limits that are subject to the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, are emitted to the atmosphere without passing through the control system and required vinyl chloride monitoring system, the vinyl chloride content of the emission shall be calculated (in units of each applicable emission limit) by best practical engineering judgment based on the discharge duration and known VC concentrations in the affected equipment as determined in accordance with § 61.67(h) or other acceptable method.
              (e) For each 3-hour period, the vinyl chloride content of emissions subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section shall be averaged (weighted according to the proportion of time that emissions were continuously monitored and that emissions bypassed the continuous monitor) for purposes of reporting excess emissions under § 61.70(c)(1).
              (f) For each vinyl chloride emission to the atmosphere determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section to be in excess of the applicable emission limits, the owner or operator shall record the identity of the source(s), the date, time, and duration of the excess emission, the cause of the excess emission, and the approximate total vinyl chloride loss during the excess emission, and the method used for determining the vinyl chloride loss. This information shall be retained and made available for inspection by the Administrator as required by § 61.71(a).

              (b)(1) In the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the effective date, the first report is to be submitted within 180 days of the effective date, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11. If a waiver of compliance is granted, the first report is to be submitted on a date scheduled by the Administrator.
              (2) In the case of a new source which did not have an initial startup date preceding the effective date, the first report is to be submitted within 180 days of the initial startup date.
              (c) Unless otherwise specified, the owner or operator shall use the test methods in appendix B to this part to conduct emission tests as required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, unless an alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn.
              (1) The owner or operator shall include in the report a record of the vinyl chloride content of emissions for each 3-hour period during which average emissions are in excess of the emission limits in § 61.62(a) or (b), § 61.63(a), or § 61.64(a)(1), (b), (c), or (d), or during which average emissions are in excess of the emission limits specified for any control system to which reactor emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.65(b)(I)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), or (b)(9)(ii). The number of 3-hour periods for which average emissions were determined during the reporting period shall be reported. If emissions in excess of the emission limits are not detected, the report shall contain a statement that no excess emissions have been detected. The emissions are to be determined in accordance with § 61.68(e).
              (2) In polyvinyl chloride plants for which a stripping operation is used to attain the emission level prescribed in § 61.64(e), the owner or operator shall include in the report a record of the vinyl chloride content in the polyvinyl chloride resin.

The method for calculating effective dose equivalent and the definition of reference man are outlined in the International Commission on Radiological Protection's Publication No. 26.
              (b) Facility means all buildings, structures and operations on one contiguous site.
              (c) Radionuclide means a type of atom which spontaneously undergoes radioactive decay.

              § 61.92
              Standard.
              Emissions of radionuclides to the ambient air from Department of Energy facilities shall not exceed those amounts that would cause any member of the public to receive in any year an effective dose equivalent of 10 mrem/yr.
            
            
              § 61.93
              Emission monitoring and test procedures.
              (a) To determine compliance with the standard, radionuclide emissions shall be determined and effective dose equivalent values to members of the public calculated using EPA approved sampling procedures, computer models CAP-88 or AIRDOS-PC, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval. DOE facilities for which the maximally exposed individual lives within 3 kilometers of all sources of emissions in the facility, may use EPA's COMPLY model and associated procedures for determining dose for purposes of compliance.
              (b) Radionuclides emission rates from existing point sources (stacks or vents) shall be measured in accordance with the following requirements or with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:
              (1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the following methods:
              (i) Reference Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large vents.
              (ii) Reference Method 2A of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.
              (iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon the variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.
              (2) Radionuclides shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected and measured using the following methods:
              (i) Reference Method 1 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to select monitoring or sampling sites.

              (ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following the guidance presented in ANSIN13.1-1969 “Guide to Sampling Airborne Radioactive Materials in Nuclear Facilities” (including the guidance presented in appendix A of ANSIN13.1) (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18). The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the emissions.
              (iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 114. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve measurement procedures.
              (iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
              (3) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at an existing source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at an existing source in accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:
              (i) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
              (ii) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.
              (iii) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
              (iv) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
              (4)(i) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be made at all release points which have a potential to discharge radionuclides into the air in quantities which could cause an effective dose equivalent in excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides which could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other release points which have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low emissions.
              (ii) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise normal.
              (5) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
              (i) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously sampled for collection of radionuclides.
              (ii) Those radionuclides released from the facility, which are the major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected and measured as part of the environmental measurement program.
              (iii) Radionuclide concentrations which would cause an effective dose equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and distinguishable from background.

              (iv) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E to determine compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in Table 2, and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 for each radionuclide is less than 1.
              (v) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
              (vi) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.
              (c) Radionuclide emission rates from new point sources (stacks or vents) as defined in subpart A shall be measured in accordance with the following requirements, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:
              (1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the following methods:
              (i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 “Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities' (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18) shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large vents.
              (ii) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.
              (iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.
              (2) Radionuclide shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected and measured using the following methods:

              (ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following the guidance presented in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999. The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the emissions.
              (iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve measurement procedures.
              (iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999.
              (d) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at a source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (c) of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at a source in accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) or (c) of this section, the facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:
              (1) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) or (c) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
              (2) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.
              (3) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
              (4) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.

              (e) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be made at all release points that have a potential to discharge radionuclides into the air in quantities that could cause an effective dose equivalent in excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides that could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other release points that have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low emissions.
              (f) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point.

              (g) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
              (1) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously sampled for collection of radionuclides.

              (3) Radionuclide concentrations that would cause an effective dose equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and distinguishable from background.
              (4) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to the concentration levels in Table 2 appendix E of this part to determine compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in Table 2 of appendix E of this part, and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 of appendix E of this part for each radionuclide is less than 1.
              (5) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part.

              § 61.94
              Compliance and reporting.
              (a) Compliance with this standard shall be determined by calculating the highest effective dose equivalent to any member of the public at any offsite point where there is a residence, school, business or office. The owners or operators of each facility shall submit an annual report to both EPA headquarters and the appropriate regional office by June 30 which includes the results of the monitoring as recorded in DOE's Effluent Information System and the dose calculations required by § 61.93(a) for the previous calendar year.
              (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, an annual report shall include the following information:
              (1) The name and location of the facility.
              (2) A list of the radioactive materials used at the facility.
              (3) A description of the handling and processing that the radioactive materials undergo at the facility.
              (4) A list of the stacks or vents or other points where radioactive materials are released to the atmosphere.
              (5) A description of the effluent controls that are used on each stack, vent, or other release point and an estimate of the efficiency of each control device.

              (6) Distances from the points of release to the nearest residence, school, business or office and the nearest farms producing vegetables, milk, and meat.
              (7) The values used for all other user-supplied input parameters for the computer models (e.g., meteorological data) and the source of these data.
              (8) A brief description of all construction and modifications which were completed in the calendar year for which the report is prepared, but for which the requirement to apply for approval to construct or modify was waived under § 61.96 and associated documentation developed by DOE to support the waiver. EPA reserves the right to require that DOE send to EPA all the information that normally would be required in an application to construct or modify, following receipt of the description and supporting documentation.
              (9) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer or public official in charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately above the signature line: “I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.”
              (c) If the facility is not in compliance with the emission limits of § 61.92 in the calendar year covered by the report, then the facility must commence reporting to the Administrator on a monthly basis the information listed in paragraph (b) of this section, for the preceding month. These reports will start the month immediately following the submittal of the annual report for the year in noncompliance and will be due 30 days following the end of each month. This increased level of reporting will continue until the Administrator has determined that the monthly reports are no longer necessary. In addition to all the information required in paragraph (b) of this section, monthly reports shall also include the following information:
              (1) All controls or other changes in operation of the facility that will be or are being installed to bring the facility into compliance.
              (2) If the facility is under a judicial or administrative enforcement decree, the report will describe the facilities performance under the terms of the decree.
              (d) In those instances where the information requested is classified, such information will be made available to EPA separate from the report and will be handled and controlled according to applicable security and classification regulations and requirements.
            
            
              § 61.95
              Recordkeeping requirements.
              All facilities must maintain records documenting the source of input parameters including the results of all measurements upon which they are based, the calculations and/or analytical methods used to derive values for input parameters, and the procedure used to determine effective dose equivalent. This documentation should be sufficient to allow an independent auditor to verify the accuracy of the determination made concerning the facility's compliance with the standard. These records must be kept at the site of the facility for at least five years and, upon request, be made available for inspection by the Administrator, or his authorized representative.
            
            
              § 61.96
              Applications to construct or modify.
              (a) In addition to any activity that is defined as construction under 40 CFR part 61, subpart A, any fabrication, erection or installation of a new building or structure within a facility that emits radionuclides is also defined as new construction for purposes of 40 CFR part 61, subpart A.

              (b) An application for approval under § 61.07 or notification of startup under § 61.09 does not need to be filed for any new construction of or modification within an existing facility if the effective dose equivalent, caused by all emissions from the new construction or modification, is less than 1% of the standard prescribed in § 61.92. For purposes of this paragraph the effective dose equivalent shall be calculated using the source term derived using appendix D as input to the dispersion and other computer models described in § 61.93. DOE may, with prior approval from EPA, use another procedure for estimating the source term for use in this paragraph. A facility is eligible for this exemption only if, based on its last annual report, the facility is in compliance with this subpart.
              (c) Conditions to approvals granted under § 61.08 will not contain requirements for post approval reporting on operating conditions beyond those specified in § 61.94.

              Determining compliance.

              (a) Compliance with the emission standard in this subpart shall be determined through the use of either the EPA computer code COMPLY or the alternative requirements of appendix E. Facilities emitting radionuclides not listed in COMPLY or appendix E shall contact EPA to receive the information needed to determine dose. The source terms to be used for input into COMPLY shall be determined through the use of the measurement procedures listed in § 61.107 or the emission factors in appendix D or through alternative procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval; or,
              (b) Facilities may demonstrate compliance with the emission standard in this subpart through the use of computer models that are equivalent to COMPLY, provided that the model has received prior approval from EPA headquarters. Any facility using a model other than COMPLY must file an annual report. EPA may approve an alternative model in whole or in part and may limit its use to specific circumstances.

              Recordkeeping requirements.
              The owner or operator of any facility must maintain records documenting the source of input parameters including the results of all measurements upon which they are based, the calculations and/or analytical methods used to derive values for input parameters, and the procedure used to determine compliance. This documentation should be sufficient to allow an independent auditor to verify the accuracy of the determination made concerning the facility's compliance with the standard, and, if claimed, qualification for exemption from reporting. These records must be kept at the site of the facility for at least five years and upon request be made available for inspection by the Administrator, or his authorized representative.
            
            
              § 61.106
              Applications to construct or modify.
              (a) In addition to any activity that is defined as construction under 40 CFR part 61, subpart A, any fabrication, erection or installation of a new building or structure within a facility is also defined as new construction for purposes of 40 CFR part 61, subpart A.
              (b) An application under § 61.07 does not need to be filed for any new construction of or modification within an existing facility if one of the following conditions is met:
              (1) The effective dose equivalent calculated by using methods described in § 61.103, that is caused by all emissions from the facility including those potentially emitted by the proposed new construction or modification, is less than 10% of the standard prescribed in § 61.102.
              (2) The effective dose equivalent calculated by using methods described in § 61.103, that is caused by all emissions from the new construction or modification, is less than 1% of the limit prescribed in § 61.102. A facility is eligible for this exemption only if the facility, based on its last annual report, is in compliance with this subpart.
            
            
              § 61.107
              Emission determination.
              (a) Facility owners or operators may, in lieu of monitoring, estimate radionuclide emissions in accordance with appendix D, or other procedure for which EPA has granted prior approval.
              (b) Radionuclide emission rates from existing point sources (stacks or vents) shall be measured in accordance with the following requirements or within the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:
              (1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the following methods:
              (i) Reference Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large vents.
              (ii) Reference Method 2A of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.

              (iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon the variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.
              
              (2) Radionuclides shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected, and measured using the following methods:
              (i) Reference Method 1 of appendix A part 60 of this chapter shall be used to select monitoring or sampling sites.
              (ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously using an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following the guidance presented in ANSIN13.1-1969 “Guide to Sampling Airborne Radioactive Materials in Nuclear Facilities” (including the guidance presented in appendix A of ANSIN13.1) (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18). The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the emissions.
              (iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 114. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve alternative measurement procedures in whole or in part.
              (iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
              (3) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at an existing source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at an existing source in accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:
              (i) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
              (ii) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.
              (iii) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
              (iv) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
              (4)(i) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be made at all release points which have a potential to discharge radionuclides into the air in quantities which could cause an effective dose equivalent in excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides which could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured. For other release points which have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements should be made to verify the low emissions.
              (ii) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to discharge radionuclides into the air, the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge of the uncontrolled effluent stream into the air.
              (5) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standards if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
              (i) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously sampled for collection of radionuclides.
              (ii) Those radionuclides released from the facility, which are the major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected and measured as part of the environmental measurements program.

              (iii) Radionuclide concentrations which would cause an effective dose equivalent greater than or equal to 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and distinguishable from background.
              (iv) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E to determine compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in Table 2 and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 for each radionuclide is less than 1.
              (v) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
              (vi) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.
              (c) The following facilities may use either the methodologies and quality assurance programs described in paragraph (b) of this section or may use the following:
              (1) [Reserved]
              (2) Uranium mills may determine their emissions in conformance with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Regulatory Guide 4.14 dated April 1980. In addition, they may conduct a quality assurance program as described in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Regulatory Guide 4.15 dated February 1979.
              (d) Radionuclide emission rates from new point sources (stacks or vents) as defined in subpart A shall be measured in accordance with the following requirements, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:
              (1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the following methods:
              (i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 “Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities” (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18) shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large vents.
              (ii) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.
              (iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.
              (2) Radionuclide shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected and measured using the following methods:
              (i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to select monitoring or sampling sites.
              (ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following the guidance presented in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999. The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the emissions.
              (iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve measurement procedures.
              (iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999.

              (e) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at a source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (d) of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at a source in accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) or (d) of this section, the facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:
              (1) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) or (d) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
              (2) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.
              (3) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
              (4) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
              (f) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (b) or (d) of this section shall be made at all release points that have a potential to discharge radionuclides into the air in quantities that could cause an effective dose equivalent in excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides that could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other release points that have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low emissions.
              (g) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise normal.
              (h) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
              (1) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously sampled for collection of radionuclides.
              (2) Those radionuclides released from the facility that are the major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected and measured as part of the environmental measurement program.
              (3) Radionuclide concentrations that would cause an effective dose equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and distinguishable from background.
              (4) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E of this part to determine compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in Table 2 of appendix E of this part, and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 of appendix E of this part for each radionuclide is less than 1.
              (5) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part.
              (6) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.

              Definitions.
              (a) Elemental phosphorus plant or plant means any facility that processes phosphate rock to produce elemental phosphorus. A plant includes all buildings, structures, operations, calciners and nodulizing kilns on one contiguous site.
              
              (b) Calciner or Nodulizing kiln means a unit in which phosphate rock is heated to high temperatures to remove organic material and/or to convert it to a nodular form. For the purpose of this subpart, calciners and nodulizing kilns are considered to be similar units.
            
            
              § 61.122
              Emission standard.
              Emissions of polonium-210 to the ambient air from all calciners and nodulizing kilns at an elemental phosphorus plant shall not exceed a total of 2 curies a year; except that compliance with this standard may be conclusively shown if the elemental phosphorus plant:
              (a) Installs a Hydro-Sonic ® Tandem Nozzle Fixed Throat Free-Jet Scrubber System including four scrubber units,
              (b) All four scrubber units are operated continuously with a minimum average over any 6-hour period of 40 inches (water column) of pressure drop across each scrubber during calcining of phosphate shale,
              (c) The system is used to scrub emissions from all calciners and/or nodulizing kilns at the plant, and
              (d) Total emissions of polonium-210 from the plant do not exceed 4.5 curies per year.

              § 61.123
              Emission testing.
              (a) Each owner or operator of an elemental phosphorus plant shall test emissions from the plant within 90 days of the effective date of this standard and annually thereafter. The Administrator may temporarily or permanently waive the annual testing requirement or increase the frequency of testing, if the Administrator determines that more testing is required.
              (b) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test so that EPA may, at its option, observe the test.
              (c) An emission test shall be conducted at each operational calciner or nodulizing kiln. If emissions from a calciner or nodulizing kiln are discharged through more than one stack, then an emission test shall be conducted at each stack and the total emission rate from the calciner or kiln shall be the sum of the emission rates from each of the stacks.
              (d) Each emission test shall consist of three sampling runs that meet the requirements of § 61.125. The phosphate rock processing rate during each run shall be recorded. An emission rate in curies per Mg or curies per ton of phosphate rock processed shall be calculated for each run. The average of all three runs shall apply in computing the emission rate for the test. The annual polonium-210 emission rate from a calciner or nodulizing kiln shall be determined by multiplying the measured polonium-210 emission rate in curies per Mg or curies per ton of phosphate rock processed by the annual phosphate rock processing rate in Mg (tons). In determining the annual phosphate rock processing rate, the values used for operating hours and operating capacity shall be values that will maximize the expected processing rate. For determining compliance with the emission standard of § 61.122, the total annual emission rate is the sum of the annual emission rates for all operating calciners and nodulizing kilns.
              (e) If the owner or operator changes his operation in such a way as to increase his emissions of polonium-210, such as changing the type of rock processed, the temperature of the calciners or kilns, or increasing the annual phosphate rock processing rate, then a new emission test, meeting the requirements of this section, shall be conducted within 45 days under these conditions.

              (f) Each owner or operator of an elemental phosphorus plant shall furnish the Administrator with a written report of the results of the emission test within 60 days of conducting the test. The report must provide the following information:
              (1) The name and location of the facility.
              (2) The name of the person responsible for the operation of the facility and the name of the person preparing the report (if different).
              (3) A description of the effluent controls that are used on each stack, vent, or other release point and an estimate of the efficiency of each device.
              (4) The results of the testing, including the results of each sampling run completed.
              (5) The values used in calculating the emissions and the source of these data.
              (6) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer in charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately above the signature line: “I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.”

              § 61.124
              Recordkeeping requirements.
              The owner or operator of any plant must maintain records documenting the source of input parameters including the results of all measurements upon which they are based, the calculations and/or analytical methods used to derive values for input parameters, and the procedure used in emission testing. This documentation should be sufficient to allow an independent auditor to verify the accuracy of the results of the emission testing. These records must be kept at the site of the plant for at least five years and, upon request, be made available for inspection by the Administrator, or his authorized representative.

              (1) Method 1 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine sample and velocity traverses;
              (2) Method 2 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rate;
              (3) Method 3 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used for gas analysis;
              (4) Method 5 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to collect particulate matter containing the polonium-210; and

              § 61.139
              Provisions for alternative means for process vessels, storage tanks, and tar-intercepting sumps.
              (a) As an alternative means of emission limitation for a source subject to § 61.132(a)(2) or § 61.132(d), the owner or operator may route gases from the source through a closed vent system to a carbon adsorber or vapor incinerator that is at least 98 percent efficient at removing benzene from the gas stream.
              (1) The provisions of § 61.132(a)(1) and § 61.132(a) (2)(i) and (ii) shall apply to the source.
              (2) The seals on the source and closed vent system shall be designed and operated for no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background and visual inspections, as determined by the methods specified in § 61.245(c).
              (3) The provisions of § 61.132(b) shall apply to the seals and closed vent system.
              (b) For each carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall adhere to the following practices:
              (1) Benzene captured by each carbon adsorber shall be recycled or destroyed in a manner that prevents benzene from being emitted to the atmosphere.
              (2) Carbon removed from each carbon adsorber shall be regenerated or destroyed in a manner that prevents benzene from being emitted to the atmosphere.
              (3) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall initiate regeneration of the spent carbon bed and vent the emissions from the source to a regenerated carbon bed no later than when the benzene concentration or organic vapor concentration level in the adsorber outlet vent reaches the maximum concentration point, as determined in § 61.139(h).

              (4) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall replace the carbon at the scheduled replacement time, or as soon as practicable (but not later than 16 hours) after an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected, whichever is sooner.
              (i) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the scheduled replacement time means the day that is estimated to be 90 percent of the demonstrated bed life, as defined in § 61.139(h)(5).
              (ii) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, an exceedance of the maximum concentration point shall mean any concentration greater than or equal to the maximum concentration point as determined in § 61.139(h).
              (c) Compliance with the provisions of this section shall be determined as follows:
              (1) For each carbon adsorber and vapor incinerator, the owner or operator shall demonstrate compliance with the efficiency limit by a compliance test as specified in § 61.13 and § 61.139(g). If a waiver of compliance has been granted under § 61.11, the deadline for conducting the initial compliance test shall be incorporated into the terms of the waiver. The benzene removal efficiency rate for each carbon adsorber and vapor incinerator shall be calculated as in the following equation:
              
                61-70a.eps
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = percent removal of benzene.
                Caj = concentration of benzene in vents after the control device, parts per million (ppm).
                Cbi = concentration of benzene in vents before the control device, ppm.
                Qaj = volumetric flow rate in vents after the control device, standard cubic meters/minute (scm/min) [standard cubic feet/minute (scf/min)].
                Qbi = volumetric flow rate in vents before the control device, scm/min (scf/min).
                m = number of vents after the control device.
                n = number of vents after the control device.
              
              
              (2) Compliance with all other provisions in this section shall be determined by inspections or the review of records and reports.
              (d) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall install and operate a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records either the concentration of benzene or the concentration level of organic compounds in the outlet vent of the carbon adsorber. The monitoring device shall be installed, calibrated, maintained and operated in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.
              (1) Measurement of benzene concentration shall be made according to § 61.139(g)(2).
              (2) All measurements of organic compound concentration levels shall be reasonable indicators of benzene concentration.
              (i) The monitoring device for measuring organic compound concentration levels shall be based on one of the following detection principles: Infrared absorption, flame ionization, catalytic oxidation, photoionization, or thermal conductivity.
              (ii) The monitoring device shall meet the requirements of part 60, appendix A, Method 21, sections 2, 3, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4. For the purpose of the application of Method 21 to this section, the words “leak definition” shall be the maximum concentration point, which would be estimated until it is established under § 61.139(h). The calibration gas shall either be benzene or methane and shall be at a concentration associated with 125 percent of the expected organic compound concentration level for the carbon adsorber outlet vent.
              (e) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall monitor either the concentration of benzene or the concentration level of organic compounds at the outlet vent of the adsorber. The monitoring device shall be calibrated, operated and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.
              (1) Measurements of benzene concentration shall be made according to § 61.139(g)(2). The measurement shall be conducted over at least one 5-minute interval during which flow into the carbon adsorber is expected to occur.

              (2) All measurements of organic compound concentration levels shall be reasonable indicators of benzene concentration.
              
              (i) The monitoring device for measuring organic compound concentration levels shall meet the requirements of paragraphs § 61.139(d)(2) (i) and (ii).
              (ii) The probe inlet of the monitoring device shall be placed at approximately the center of the carbon adsorber outlet vent. The probe shall be held there for at least 5 minutes during which flow into the carbon adsorber is expected to occur. The maximum reading during that period shall be used as the measurement.
              (3) Monitoring shall be performed at least once within the first 7 days after replacement of the carbon bed occurs, and monthly thereafter until 10 days before the scheduled replacement time, at which point monitoring shall be done daily, except as specified in paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section.
              (4) If an owner or operator detects an exceedance of the maximum concentration point during the monthly monitoring or on the first day of daily monitoring as prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, then, after replacing the bed, the owner or operator shall begin the daily monitoring of the replacement carbon bed on the day after the last scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was detected, or 10 days before the exceedance was detected, whichever is longer.
              (5) If an owner or operator detects an exceedance of the maximum concentration point during the daily monitoring as prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, except on the first day, then, after replacing the bed, the owner or operator shall begin the daily monitoring of the replacement carbon bed 10 days before the exceedance was detected.
              (6) If the owner or operator is monitoring on the schedule required in paragraph (e)(4) or paragraph (e)(5) of this section, and the scheduled replacement time is reached without exceeding the maximum concentration point, the owner or operator may return to the monitoring schedule in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for subsequent carbon beds.
              
                Note:
                This note provides an example of the monitoring schedules in paragraphs (e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section. Assume that the scheduled replacement time for a non-regenerative carbon adsorber is the 105th day after installation. According to the monitoring schedule in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, initial monitoring would be done within 7 days after installation, monthly monitoring would be done on the 30th, 60th and 90th days, and daily monitoring would begin on the 95th day after installation. Now assume that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 90th day after installation. On the replacement carbon bed, the owner or operator would begin daily monitoring on the 61st day after installation (i.e., the day after the last scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was detected), according to the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If, instead, the exceedance were detected on the first bed on the 95th day, the daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on the 85th day after installation (i.e., 10 days before the point in the cycle where the exceedance was detected); this is a second example of the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Finally, assume that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 100th day after the first carbon adsorber was installed. According to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on the 90th day after installation (i.e., 10 days earlier than when the exceedance was detected on the previous bed). In all of these examples, the initial monitoring of the replacement bed within 7 days of installation and the monthly monitoring would proceed as set out in paragraph (e)(3) of this section until daily monitoring was required.
              
              (f) For each vapor incinerator, the owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements specified below:
              (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 °C, whichever is greater.
              (i) Where a vapor incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox.
              (ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.

              (2) Comply with paragraph (f)(2)(i), paragraph (f)(2)(ii), or paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
              
              (i) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow to the incinerator at least once every hour for each source. The flow indicator shall be installed in the vent stream from each source at a point closest to the inlet of each vapor incinerator and before being joined with any other vent stream.
              (ii) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow away from the vapor incinerator at least once every 15 minutes. The flow indicator shall be installed in each bypass line, immediately downstream of the valve that, if opened, would divert the vent stream away from the vapor incinerator.
              (iii) Where a valve that opens a bypass line is secured in the closed position with a car seal or a lock-and-key configuration, a flow indicator is not required. The owner or operator shall perform a visual inspection at least once every month to check the position of the valve and the condition of the car seal or lock-and-key configuration. The owner or operator shall also record the date and duration of each time that the valve was opened and the vent stream diverted away from the vapor incinerator.
              (g) In conducting the compliance tests required in § 61.139(c), and measurements specified in § 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and (h)(3)(ii), the owner or operator shall use as reference methods the test methods and procedures in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, or other methods as specified in this paragraph, except as specified in § 61.13.
              (1) For compliance tests, as described in § 61.139(c)(1), the following provisions apply.
              (i) All tests shall be run under representative emission concentration and vent flow rate conditions. For sources with intermittent flow rates, representative conditions shall include typical emission surges (for example, during the loading of a storage tank).
              (ii) Each test shall consist of three separate runs. These runs will be averaged to yield the volumetric flow rates and benzene concentrations in the equation in § 61.139(c)(1). Each run shall be a minimum of 1 hour.
              (A) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, each run shall take place in one adsorption cycle, to include a minimum of 1 hour of sampling immediately preceding the initiation of carbon bed regeneration.
              (B) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, all runs can occur during one adsorption cycle.
              (iii) The measurements during the runs shall be paired so that the inlet and outlet to the control device are measured simultaneously.
              (iv) Method 1 or 1A shall be used as applicable for locating measurement sites.
              (v) Method 2, 2A, or 2D shall be used as applicable for measuring vent flow rates.

              (vi) Method 18 shall be used for determining the benzene concentrations (Caj and Cbi). Either the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure or the direct interface procedure may be used. A separation column constructed of stainless steel, 1.83 m by 3.2 mm, containing 10 percent 1,2,3-tris (2-cyanoethoxy) propane (TECP) on 80/100 mesh Chromosorb P AW, with a column temperature of 80 °C, a detector temperature of 225 °C, and a flow rate of approximately 20 ml/min, may produce adequate separations. The analyst can use other columns, provided that the precision and accuracy of the analysis of benzene standards is not impaired. The analyst shall have available for review information confirming that there is adequate resolution of the benzene peak.
              (A) If the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure is used, the sample rate shall be adjusted to maintain a constant proportion to vent flow rate.

              (B) If the direct interface sampling and analysis procedure is used, then each performance test run shall be conducted in intervals of 5 minutes. For each interval “t,” readings from each measurement shall be recorded, and the flow rate (Qaj or Qbi) and the corresponding benzene concentration (Caj or Cbi) shall be determined. The sampling system shall be constructed to include a mixing chamber of a volume equal to 5 times the sampling flow rate per minute. Each analysis performed by the chromatograph will then represent an averaged emission value for a 5-minute time period. The vent flow rate readings shall be timed to account for the total sample system residence time. A dual column, dual detector chromatograph can be used to achieve an analysis interval of 5 minutes. The individual benzene concentrations shall be vent flow rate weighted to determine sample run average concentrations. The individual vent flow rates shall be time averaged to determine sample run average flow rates.
              (2) For testing the benzene concentration at the outlet vent of the carbon adsorber as specified under §§ 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and (h)(3)(ii), the following provisions apply.
              (i) The measurement shall be conducted over one 5-minute period.
              (ii) The requirements in § 61.139(g)(1)(i) shall apply to the extent practicable.
              (iii) The requirements in § 61.139(g)(1)(vi) shall apply. Section 7.2 of method 18 shall be used as described in § 61.139(g)(1)(vi)(B) for benzene concentration measurements.
              (h) For each carbon adsorber, the maximum concentration point shall be expressed either as a benzene concentration or organic compound concentration level, whichever is to be indicated by the monitoring device chosen under § 61.139 (d) or (e).
              (1) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall determine the maximum concentration point at the following times:
              (i) No later than the deadline for the initial compliance test as specified in § 61.139(c)(1);
              (ii) At the request of the Administrator; and
              (iii) At any time chosen by the owner or operator.
              (2) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall determine the maximum concentration point at the following times:
              (i) On the first carbon bed to be installed in the adsorber;
              (ii) At the request of the Administrator;
              (iii) On the next carbon bed after the maximum concentration point has been exceeded (before the scheduled replacement time) for each of three previous carbon beds in the adsorber since the most recent determination; and
              (iv) At any other time chosen by the owner or operator.
              (3) The maximum concentration point for each carbon adsorber shall be determined through the simultaneous measurement of the outlet of the carbon adsorber with the monitoring device and Method 18, except as allowed in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
              (i) Several data points shall be collected according to a schedule determined by the owner or operator. The schedule shall be designed to take frequent samples near the expected maximum concentration point.
              (ii) Each data point shall consist of one 5-minute benzene concentration measurement using Method 18 as specified in § 61.139(g)(2), and of a simultaneous measurement by the monitoring device. The monitoring device measurement shall be conducted according to § 61.139 (d) or (e), whichever is applicable.
              (iii) The maximum concentration point shall be the concentration level, as indicated by the monitoring device, for the last data point at which the benzene concentration is less than 2 percent of the average value of the benzene concentration at the inlet to the carbon adsorber during the most recent compliance test.
              (4) If the maximum concentration point is expressed as a benzene concentration, the owner or operator may determine it by calibrating the monitoring device with benzene at a concentration that is 2 percent of the average benzene concentration measured at the inlet to the carbon adsorber during the most recent compliance test. The reading on the monitoring device corresponding to the calibration concentration shall be the maximum concentration point. This method of determination would affect the owner or operator as follows:
              (i) For a regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator is exempt from the provisions in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

              (ii) For a non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator is required to collect the data points in paragraph (h)(3) of this section with only the monitoring device, and is exempt from the simultaneous Method 18 measurement.
              (5) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the demonstrated bed life shall be the carbon bed life, measured in days from the time the bed is installed until the maximum concentration point is reached, for the carbon bed that is used to determine the maximum concentration point.
              (i) The following recordkeeping requirements are applicable to owners and operators of control devices subject to § 61.139. All records shall be kept updated and in a readily accessible location.
              (1) The following information shall be recorded for each control device for the life of the control device:
              (i) The design characteristics of the control device and a list of the source or sources vented to it.
              (ii) For each carbon absorber, a plan for the method for handling captured benzene and removed carbon to comply with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
              (iii) The dates and descriptions of any changes in the design specifications or plan.
              (iv) For each carbon adsorber for which organic compounds are monitored as provided under § 61.139 (d) and (e), documentation to show that the measurements of organic compound concentrations are reasonable indicators of benzene concentrations.
              (2) For each compliance test as specified in § 61.139(c)(1), the date of the test, the results of the test, and other data needed to determine emissions shall be recorded as specified in § 61.13(g) for at least 2 years or until the next compliance test on the control device, whichever is longer.
              (3) For each vapor incinerator, the average firebox temperature of the incinerator (or the average temperature upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed for a catalytic incinerator), measured and averaged over the most recent compliance test shall be recorded for at least 2 years or until the next compliance test on the incinerator, whichever is longer.
              (4) For each carbon adsorber, for each determination of a maximum concentration point as specified in § 61.139(h), the date of the determination, the maximum concentration point, and data needed to make the determination shall be recorded for at least 2 years or until the next maximum concentration point determination on the carbon adsorber, whichever is longer.
              (5) For each carbon absorber, the dates of and data from the monitoring required in § 61.139(d) and (e), the date and time of replacement of each carbon bed, the date of each exceedance of the maximum concentration point, and a brief description of the corrective action taken shall be recorded for at least 2 years. Also, the occurrences when the captured benzene or spent carbon are not handled as required in § 61.139(b)(1) and (2) shall be recorded for at least 2 years.

              (c) Procedures for asbestos emission control. Each owner or operator of a demolition or renovation activity to whom this paragraph applies, according to paragraph (a) of this section, shall comply with the following procedures:
              (1) Remove all RACM from a facility being demolished or renovated before any activity begins that would break up, dislodge, or similarly disturb the material or preclude access to the material for subsequent removal. RACM need not be removed before demolition if:
              (i) It is Category I nonfriable ACM that is not in poor condition and is not friable.
              (ii) It is on a facility component that is encased in concrete or other similarly hard material and is adequately wet whenever exposed during demolition; or
              (iii) It was not accessible for testing and was, therefore, not discovered until after demolition began and, as a result of the demolition, the material cannot be safely removed. If not removed for safety reasons, the exposed RACM and any asbestos-contaminated debris must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and adequately wet at all times until disposed of.
              (iv) They are Category II nonfriable ACM and the probability is low that the materials will become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder during demolition.
              (2) When a facility component that contains, is covered with, or is coated with RACM is being taken out of the facility as a unit or in sections:
              (i) Adequately wet all RACM exposed during cutting or disjoining operations; and
              (ii) Carefully lower each unit or section to the floor and to ground level, not dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or disturbing the RACM.
              (3) When RACM is stripped from a facility component while it remains in place in the facility, adequately wet the RACM during the stripping operation.
              (i) In renovation operations, wetting is not required if:
              (A) The owner or operator has obtained prior written approval from the Administrator based on a written application that wetting to comply with this paragraph would unavoidably damage equipment or present a safety hazard; and

              (B) The owner or operator uses of the following emission control methods:
              
              (1) A local exhaust ventilation and collection system designed and operated to capture the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping and removal of the asbestos materials. The system must exhibit no visible emissions to the outside air or be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements in § 61.152.
              (2) A glove-bag system designed and operated to contain the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping of the asbestos materials.
              (3) Leak-tight wrapping to contain all RACM prior to dismantlement.
              (ii) In renovation operations where wetting would result in equipment damage or a safety hazard, and the methods allowed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section cannot be used, another method may be used after obtaining written approval from the Administrator based upon a determination that it is equivalent to wetting in controlling emissions or to the methods allowed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
              (iii) A copy of the Administrator's written approval shall be kept at the worksite and made available for inspection.
              (4) After a facility component covered with, coated with, or containing RACM has been taken out of the facility as a unit or in sections pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, it shall be stripped or contained in leak-tight wrapping, except as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If stripped, either:
              (i) Adequately wet the RACM during stripping; or
              (ii) Use a local exhaust ventilation and collection system designed and operated to capture the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping. The system must exhibit no visible emissions to the outside air or be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements in § 61.152.
              (5) For large facility components such as reactor vessels, large tanks, and steam generators, but not beams (which must be handled in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this section), the RACM is not required to be stripped if the following requirements are met:
              (i) The component is removed, transported, stored, disposed of, or reused without disturbing or damaging the RACM.
              (ii) The component is encased in a leak-tight wrapping.
              (iii) The leak-tight wrapping is labeled according to § 61.149(d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) during all loading and unloading operations and during storage.
              (6) For all RACM, including material that has been removed or stripped:
              (i) Adequately wet the material and ensure that it remains wet until collected and contained or treated in preparation for disposal in accordance with § 61.150; and
              (ii) Carefully lower the material to the ground and floor, not dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or disturbing the material.
              (iii) Transport the material to the ground via leak-tight chutes or containers if it has been removed or stripped more than 50 feet above ground level and was not removed as units or in sections.

              (iv) RACM contained in leak-tight wrapping that has been removed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section need not be wetted.
              (7) When the temperature at the point of wetting is below 0 °C (32 °F):
              (i) The owner or operator need not comply with paragraph (c)(2)(i) and the wetting provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (ii) The owner or operator shall remove facility components containing, coated with, or covered with RACM as units or in sections to the maximum extent possible.
              (iii) During periods when wetting operations are suspended due to freezing temperatures, the owner or operator must record the temperature in the area containing the facility components at the beginning, middle, and end of each workday and keep daily temperature records available for inspection by the Administrator during normal business hours at the demolition or renovation site. The owner or operator shall retain the temperature records for at least 2 years.

              (8) Effective 1 year after promulgation of this regulation, no RACM shall be stripped, removed, or otherwise handled or disturbed at a facility regulated by this section unless at least one on-site representative, such as a foreman or management-level person or other authorized representative, trained in the provisions of this regulation and the means of complying with them, is present. Every 2 years, the trained on-site individual shall receive refresher training in the provisions of this regulation. The required training shall include as a minimum: applicability; notifications; material identification; control procedures for removals including, at least, wetting, local exhaust ventilation, negative pressure enclosures, glove-bag procedures, and High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; waste disposal work practices; reporting and recordkeeping; and asbestos hazards and worker protection. Evidence that the required training has been completed shall be posted and made available for inspection by the Administrator at the demolition or renovation site.
              (9) For facilities described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, adequately wet the portion of the facility that contains RACM during the wrecking operation.
              (10) If a facility is demolished by intentional burning, all RACM including Category I and Category II nonfriable ACM must be removed in accordance with the NESHAP before burning.

              § 61.151
              Standard for inactive waste disposal sites for asbestos mills and manufacturing and fabricating operations.
              Each owner or operator of any inactive waste disposal site that was operated by sources covered under § 61.142, 61.144, or 61.147 and received deposits of asbestos-containing waste material generated by the sources, shall:
              (a) Comply with one of the following:
              (1) Either discharge no visible emissions to the outside air from an inactive waste disposal site subject to this paragraph; or
              (2) Cover the asbestos-containing waste material with at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) of compacted nonasbestos-containing material, and grow and maintain a cover of vegetation on the area adequate to prevent exposure of the asbestos-containing waste material. In desert areas where vegetation would be difficult to maintain, at least 8 additional centimeters (3 inches) of well-graded, nonasbestos crushed rock may be placed on top of the final cover instead of vegetation and maintained to prevent emissions; or
              (3) Cover the asbestos-containing waste material with at least 60 centimeters (2 feet) of compacted nonasbestos-containing material, and maintain it to prevent exposure of the asbestos-containing waste; or
              (4) For inactive waste disposal sites for asbestos tailings, a resinous or petroleum-based dust suppression agent that effectively binds dust to control surface air emissions may be used instead of the methods in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section. Use the agent in the manner and frequency recommended for the particular asbestos tailings by the manufacturer of the dust suppression agent to achieve and maintain dust control. Obtain prior written approval of the Administrator to use other equally effective dust suppression agents. For purposes of this paragraph, any used, spent, or other waste oil is not considered a dust suppression agent.
              (b) Unless a natural barrier adequately deters access by the general public, install and maintain warning signs and fencing as follows, or comply with paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.
              (1) Display warning signs at all entrances and at intervals of 100 m (328 ft) or less along the property line of the site or along the perimeter of the sections of the site where asbestos-containing waste material was deposited. The warning signs must:
              (i) Be posted in such a manner and location that a person can easily read the legend; and
              (ii) Conform to the requirements for 51 cm × 36 cm (20″ × 14″) upright format signs specified in 29 CFR 1910.145(d)(4) and this paragraph; and
              (iii) Display the following legend in the lower panel with letter sizes and styles of a visibility at least equal to those specified in this paragraph.

              (b) Unless a natural barrier adequately deters access by the general public, either warning signs and fencing must be installed and maintained as follows, or the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be met.
              (1) Warning signs must be displayed at all entrances and at intervals of 100 m (330 ft) or less along the property line of the site or along the perimeter of the sections of the site where asbestos-containing waste material is deposited. The warning signs must:
              (i) Be posted in such a manner and location that a person can easily read the legend; and
              (ii) Conform to the requirements of 51 cm × 36 cm (20″ × 14″) upright format signs specified in 29 CFR 1910.145(d)(4) and this paragraph; and
              (iii) Display the following legend in the lower panel with letter sizes and styles of a visibility at least equal to those specified in this paragraph.

              Spacing between any two lines must be at least equal to the height of the upper of the two lines.
              (2) The perimeter of the disposal site must be fenced in a manner adequate to deter access by the general public.
              (3) Upon request and supply of appropriate information, the Administrator will determine whether a fence or a natural barrier adequately deters access by the general public.
              (c) Rather than meet the no visible emission requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, at the end of each operating day, or at least once every 24-hour period while the site is in continuous operation, the asbestos-containing waste material that has been deposited at the site during the operating day or previous 24-hour period shall:
              (1) Be covered with at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) of compacted nonasbestos-containing material, or
              (2) Be covered with a resinous or petroleum-based dust suppression agent that effectively binds dust and controls wind erosion. Such an agent shall be used in the manner and frequency recommended for the particular dust by the dust suppression agent manufacturer to achieve and maintain dust control. Other equally effective dust suppression agents may be used upon prior approval by the Administrator. For purposes of this paragraph, any used, spent, or other waste oil is not considered a dust suppression agent.
              (d) Rather than meet the no visible emission requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, use an alternative emissions control method that has received prior written approval by the Administrator according to the procedures described in § 61.149(c)(2).
              (e) For all asbestos-containing waste material received, the owner or operator of the active waste disposal site shall:
              (1) Maintain waste shipment records, using a form similar to that shown in Figure 4, and include the following information:
              (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the waste generator.
              (ii) The name, address, and telephone number of the transporter(s).
              (iii) The quantity of the asbestos-containing waste material in cubic meters (cubic yards).

              (iv) The presence of improperly enclosed or uncovered waste, or any asbestos-containing waste material not sealed in leak-tight containers. Report in writing to the local, State, or EPA Regional office responsible for administering the asbestos NESHAP program for the waste generator (identified in the waste shipment record), and, if different, the local, State, or EPA Regional office responsible for administering the asbestos NESHAP program for the disposal site, by the following working day, the presence of a significant amount of improperly enclosed or uncovered waste. Submit a copy of the waste shipment record along with the report.
              (v) The date of the receipt.
              (2) As soon as possible and no longer than 30 days after receipt of the waste, send a copy of the signed waste shipment record to the waste generator.
              (3) Upon discovering a discrepancy between the quantity of waste designated on the waste shipment records and the quantity actually received, attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator. If the discrepancy is not resolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, immediately report in writing to the local, State, or EPA Regional office responsible for administering the asbestos NESHAP program for the waste generator (identified in the waste shipment record), and, if different, the local, State, or EPA Regional office responsible for administering the asbestos NESHAP program for the disposal site. Describe the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and submit a copy of the waste shipment record along with the report.
              (4) Retain a copy of all records and reports required by this paragraph for at least 2 years.
              (f) Maintain, until closure, records of the location, depth and area, and quantity in cubic meters (cubic yards) of asbestos-containing waste material within the disposal site on a map or diagram of the disposal area.
              (g) Upon closure, comply with all the provisions of § 61.151.
              (h) Submit to the Administrator, upon closure of the facility, a copy of records of asbestos waste disposal locations and quantities.
              (i) Furnish upon request, and make available during normal business hours for inspection by the Administrator, all records required under this section.
              (j) Notify the Administrator in writing at least 45 days prior to excavating or otherwise disturbing any asbestos-containing waste material that has been deposited at a waste disposal site and is covered. If the excavation will begin on a date other than the one contained in the original notice, notice of the new start date must be provided to the Administrator at least 10 working days before excavation begins and in no event shall excavation begin earlier than the date specified in the original notification. Include the following information in the notice:
              (1) Scheduled starting and completion dates.
              (2) Reason for disturbing the waste.
              (3) Procedures to be used to control emissions during the excavation, storage, transport, and ultimate disposal of the excavated asbestos-containing waste material. If deemed necessary, the Administrator may require changes in the emission control procedures to be used.
              (4) Location of any temporary storage site and the final disposal site.

              (2) Monitor input materials to ensure that they are consistent with the test feed materials described during start-up performance tests in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
              (3) Collect and analyze samples, taken as 10-day composite samples (one 200-gram (7-ounce) sample collected every 8 hours of operation) of all output material for the presence of asbestos. Composite samples may be for fewer than 10 days. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shall be used to analyze the output material for the presence of asbestos. During the initial 90-day period, all output materials must be stored on-site until analysis shows the material to be asbestos-free or disposed of as asbestos-containing waste material according to § 61.150.
              (d) After the initial 90 days of operation,
              (1) Continuously monitor and record the operating parameters identified during start-up performance testing and any subsequent performance testing. Any output produced during a period of deviation from the range of operating conditions established to ensure the production of nonasbestos (asbestos-free) output materials shall be:
              (i) Disposed of as asbestos-containing waste material according to § 61.150, or
              (ii) Recycled as waste feed during process operation within the established range of operating conditions, or
              (iii) Stored temporarily on-site in a leak-tight container until analyzed for asbestos content. Any product material that is not asbestos-free shall be either disposed of as asbestos-containing waste material or recycled as waste feed to the process.
              (2) Collect and analyze monthly composite samples (one 200-gram (7-ounce) sample collected every 8 hours of operation) of the output material. Transmission electron microscopy shall be used to analyze the output material for the presence of asbestos.
              (e) Discharge no visible emissions to the outside air from any part of the operation, or use the methods specified by § 61.152 to clean emissions containing particulate asbestos material before they escape to, or are vented to, the outside air.
              (f) Maintain records on-site and include the following information:
              (1) Results of start-up performance testing and all subsequent performance testing, including operating parameters, feed characteristic, and analyses of output materials.
              (2) Results of the composite analyses required during the initial 90 days of operation under § 61.155(c).
              (3) Results of the monthly composite analyses required under § 61.155(d).

              (2) A quarterly report, including the following information concerning activities during each consecutive 3-month period:
              (i) Results of analyses of monthly product composite samples.
              (ii) A description of any deviation from the operating parameters established during performance testing, the duration of the deviation, and steps taken to correct the deviation.
              (iii) Disposition of any product produced during a period of deviation, including whether it was recycled, disposed of as asbestos-containing waste material, or stored temporarily on-site until analyzed for asbestos content.
              (iv) The information on waste disposal activities as required in § 61.154(f).
              (h) Nonasbestos (asbestos-free) output material is not subject to any of the provisions of this subpart. Output materials in which asbestos is detected, or output materials produced when the operating parameters deviated from those established during the start-up performance testing, unless shown by TEM analysis to be asbestos-free, shall be considered to be asbestos-containing waste and shall be handled and disposed of according to §§ 61.150 and 61.154 or reprocessed while all of the established operating parameters are being met.

              Appendix A to Subpart M of Part 61—Interpretive Rule Governing Roof Removal Operations
              I. Applicability of the Asbestos NESHAP
              1.1. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) is material containing more than one percent asbestos as determined using the methods specified in appendix E, subpart E, 40 CFR part 763, section 1, Polarized Light Microscopy. The NESHAP classifies ACM as either “friable” or “nonfriable”. Friable ACM is ACM that, when dry, can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure. Nonfriable ACM is ACM that, when dry, cannot be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure.
              1.2. Nonfriable ACM is further classified as either Category I ACM or Category II ACM. Category I ACM and Category II ACM are distinguished from each other by their potential to release fibers when damaged. Category I ACM includes asbestos-containing gaskets, packings, resilient floor coverings, resilient floor covering mastic, and asphalt roofing products containing more than one percent asbestos. Asphalt roofing products which may contain asbestos include built-up roofing; asphalt-containing single ply membrane systems; asphalt shingles; asphalt-containing underlayment felts; asphalt-containing roof coatings and mastics; and asphalt-containing base flashings. ACM roofing products that use other bituminous or resinous binders (such as coal tars or pitches) are also considered to be Category I ACM. Category II ACM includes all other nonfriable ACM, for example, asbestos-cement (A/C) shingles, A/C tiles, and transite boards or panels containing more than one percent asbestos. Generally speaking, Category II ACM is more likely to become friable when damaged than is Category I ACM. The applicability of the NESHAP to Category I and II ACM depends on: (1) the condition of the material at the time of demolition or renovation, (2) the nature of the operation to which the material will be subjected, (3) the amount of ACM involved.
              1.3. Asbestos-containing material regulated under the NESHAP is referred to as “regulated asbestos-containing material” (RACM). RACM is defined in § 61.141 of the NESHAP and includes: (1) friable asbestos-containing material; (2) Category I nonfriable ACM that has become friable; (3) Category I nonfriable ACM that has been or will be sanded, ground, cut, or abraded; or (4) Category II nonfriable ACM that has already been or is likely to become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder. If the coverage threshold for RACM is met or exceeded in a renovation or demolition operation, then all friable ACM in the operation, and in certain situations, nonfriable ACM in the operation, are subject to the NESHAP.
              A. Threshold Amounts of Asbestos-Containing Roofing Material
              1.A.1. The NESHAP does not cover roofing projects on single family homes or on residential buildings containing four or fewer dwelling units. 40 CFR 61.141. For other roofing renovation projects, if the total asbestos-containing roof area undergoing renovation is less than 160 ft2, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the removal method to be used, the type of material (Category I or II), or its condition (friable versus nonfriable). 40 CFR 61.145(a)(4). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. EPA has determined that where a rotating blade (RB) roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, the removal of 5580 ft2 of that material will create 160 ft2 of RACM. For the purposes of this interpretive rule, “RB roof cutter” means an engine-powered roof cutting machine with one or more rotating cutting blades the edges of which are blunt. (Equipment with blades having sharp or tapered edges, and/or which does not use a rotating blade, is used for “slicing” rather than “cutting” the roofing material; such equipment is not included in the term “RB roof cutter”.) Therefore, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, any project that is 5580 ft2 or greater is subject to the NESHAP; conversely, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material in a roof removal project that is less than 5580 ft2, the project is not subject to the NESHAP, except that notification is always required for demolitions. EPA further construes the NESHAP to mean that if slicing or other methods that do not sand, grind, cut or abrade will be used on Category I nonfriable ACM, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the area of roof to be removed.

              1.A.2. For asbestos cement (A/C) shingles (or other Category II roofing material), if the area of the roofing material to be removed is at least 160 ft2 and the removal methods will crumble, pulverize, reduce to powder, or contaminate with RACM (from other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder) 160 ft2 or more of such roofing material, the removal is subject to the NESHAP. Conversely, if the area of the A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) to be removed is less than 160 ft2, the removal is not subject to the NESHAP regardless of the removal method used, except that notification is always required for demolitions. 40 CFR 61.145(a). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. If A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) are removed without 160 ft2 or more of such roofing material being crumbled, pulverized, reduced to powder, or contaminated with RACM (from other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder), the operation is not subject to the NESHAP, even where the total area of the roofing material to be removed exceeds 160 ft2; provided, however, that if the renovation includes other operations involving RACM, the roof removal operation is covered if the total area of RACM from all renovation activities exceeds 160 ft2. See the definition of regulated asbestos-containing material (RACM), 40 CFR 61.141.

              1.A.3. Only roofing material that meets the definition of ACM can qualify as RACM subject to the NESHAP. Therefore, to determine if a removal operation that meets or exceeds the coverage threshold is subject to the NESHAP, any suspect roofing material (i.e. roofing material that may be ACM) should be tested for asbestos. If any such roofing material contains more than one percent asbestos and if the removal operation is covered by the NESHAP, then EPA must be notified and the work practices in § 61.145(c) must be followed. In EPA's view, if a removal operation involves at least the threshold level of suspect material, a roofing contractor may choose not to test for asbestos if the contractor follows the notification and work practice requirements of the NESHAP.
              B. A/C Shingle Removal (Category II ACM Removal)
              1.B.1. A/C shingles, which are Category II nonfriable ACM, become regulated ACM if the material has a high probability of becoming or has become crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by the forces expected to act on the material in the course of demolition or renovation operations. 40 CFR 61.141. However, merely breaking an A/C shingle (or any other category II ACM) that is not friable may not necessarily cause the material to become RACM. A/C shingles are typically nailed to buildings on which they are attached. EPA believes that the extent of breakage that will normally result from carefully removing A/C shingles and lowering the shingles to the ground will not result in crumbling, pulverizing or reducing the shingles to powder. Conversely, the extent of breakage that will normally occur if the A/C shingles are dropped from a building or scraped off of a building with heavy machinery would cause the shingles to become RACM. EPA therefore construes the NESHAP to mean that the removal of A/C shingles that are not friable, using methods that do not crumble, pulverize, or reduce the A/C shingles to powder (such as pry bars, spud bars and shovels to carefully pry the material), is not subject to the NESHAP provided that the A/C shingles are properly handled during and after removal, as discussed in this paragraph and the asbestos NESHAP. This interpretation also applies to other Category II nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing materials.
              C. Cutting vs. Slicing and Manual Methods for Removal of Category I ACM
              1.C.1. Because of damage to the roofing material, and the potential for fiber release, roof removal operations using rotating blade (RB) roof cutters or other equipment that sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material are subject to the NESHAP. As EPA interprets the NESHAP, the use of certain manual methods (using equipment such as axes, hatchets, or knives, spud bars, pry bars, and shovels, but not saws) or methods that slice, shear, or punch (using equipment such as a power slicer or power plow) does not constitute “cutting, sanding, grinding or abrading.” This is because these methods do not destroy the structural matrix or integrity of the material such that the material is crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder. Hence, it is EPA's interpretation that when such methods are used, assuming the roof material is not friable, the removal operation is not subject to the regulation.
              1.C.2. Power removers or power tear-off machines are typically used to pry the roofing material up from the deck after the roof membrane has been cut. It is EPA's interpretation that when these machines are used to pry roofing material up, their use is not regulated by the NESHAP.

              1.C.3. As noted previously, the NESHAP only applies to the removal of asbestos-containing roofing materials. Thus, the NESHAP does not apply to the use of RB cutters to remove non-asbestos built up roofing (BUR). On roofs containing some asbestos-containing and some non-asbestos-containing materials, coverage under the NESHAP depends on the methods used to remove each type of material in addition to other coverage thresholds specified above. For example, it is not uncommon for existing roofs to be made of non-asbestos BUR and base flashings that do contain asbestos. In that situation, EPA construes the NESHAP to be inapplicable to the removal of the non-asbestos BUR using an RB cutter so long as the RB cutter is not used to cut 5580 ft2 or more of the asbestos-containing base flashing or other asbestos-containing material into sections. In addition, the use of methods that slice, shear, punch or pry could then be used to remove the asbestos flashings and not trigger coverage under the NESHAP.
              II. Notification
              2.1. Notification for a demolition is always required under the NESHAP. However, EPA believes that few roof removal jobs constitute “demolitions” as defined in the NESHAP (§ 61.141). In particular, it is EPA's view that the removal of roofing systems (i.e., the roof membrane, insulation, surfacing, coatings, flashings, mastic, shingles, and felt underlayment), when such removal is not a part of a demolition project, constitutes a “renovation” under the NESHAP. If the operation is a renovation, and Category I roofing material is being removed using either manual methods or slicing, notification is not required by the NESHAP. If Category II material is not friable and will be removed without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, no notification is required. Also, if the renovation involves less than the threshold area for applicability as discussed above, then no notification is required. However, if a roof removal meets the applicability and threshold requirements under the NESHAP, then EPA (or the delegated agency) must be notified in advance of the removal in accordance with the requirements of § 61.145(b), as follows:
              • Notification must be given in writing at least 10 working days in advance and must include the information in § 61.145(b)(4), except for emergency renovations as discussed below.
              • The notice must be updated as necessary, including, for example, when the amount of asbestos-containing roofing material reported changes by 20 percent or more.
              • EPA must be notified if the start date of the roof removal changes. If the start date of a roof removal project is changed to an earlier date, EPA must be provided with a written notice of the new start date at least 10 working days in advance. If the start date changes to a later date, EPA must be notified by telephone as soon as possible before the original start date and a written notice must be sent as soon as possible.
              • For emergency renovations (as defined in § 61.141), where work must begin immediately to avoid safety or public health hazards, equipment damage, or unreasonable financial burden, the notification must be postmarked or delivered to EPA as soon as possible, but no later than the following work day.
              III. Emission Control Practices
              A. Requirements To Adequately Wet and Discharge No Visible Emission
              3.A.1. The principal controls contained in the NESHAP for removal operations include requirements that the affected material be adequately wetted, and that asbestos waste be handled, collected, and disposed of properly. The requirements for disposal of waste materials are discussed separately in section IV below. The emission control requirements discussed in this section III apply only to roof removal operations that are covered by the NESHAP as set forth in Section I above.
              3.A.2. For any operation subject to the NESHAP, the regulation (§§ 61.145(c)(2)(i), (3), (6)(i)) requires that RACM be adequately wet (as defined in § 61.141) during the operation that damages or disturbs the asbestos material until collected for disposal.
              3.A.3. When using an RB roof cutter (or any other method that sands, grinds, cuts or abrades the roofing material) to remove Category I asbestos-containing roofing material, the emission control requirements of § 61.145(c) apply as discussed in Section I above. EPA will consider a roof removal project to be in compliance with the “adequately wet” and “discharge no visible emission” requirements of the NESHAP if the RB roof cutter is equipped and operated with the following: (1) a blade guard that completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface; and (2) a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and which device is in operation during the cutting of the roof.
              B. Exemptions From Wetting Requirements
              3.B.1. The NESHAP provides that, in certain instances, wetting may not be required during the cutting of Category I asbestos roofing material with an RB roof cutter. If EPA determines in accordance with § 61.145(c)(3)(i), that wetting will unavoidably damage the building, equipment inside the building, or will present a safety hazard while stripping the ACM from a facility component that remains in place, the roof removal operation will be exempted from the requirement to wet during cutting. EPA must have sufficient written information on which to base such a decision. Before proceeding with a dry removal, the contractor must have received EPA's written approval. Such exemptions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

              3.B.2. It is EPA's view that, in most instances, exemptions from the wetting requirements are not necessary. Where EPA grants an exemption from wetting because of the potential for damage to the building, damage to equipment within the building or a safety hazard, the NESHAP specifies alternative control methods (§ 61.145(c)(3)(i)(B)). Alternative control methods include (a) the use of local exhaust ventilation systems that capture the dust, and do not produce visible emissions, or (b) methods that are designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of § 61.152, or (c) other methods that have received the written approval of EPA. EPA will consider an alternative emission control method in compliance with the NESHAP if the method has received written approval from EPA and the method is being implemented consistent with the approved procedures (§ 61.145(c)(3)(ii) or § 61.152(b)(3)).
              3.B.3. An exemption from wetting is also allowed when the air or roof surface temperature at the point of wetting is below freezing, as specified in § 61.145(c)(7). If freezing temperatures are indicated as the reason for not wetting, records must be kept of the temperature at the beginning, middle and end of the day on which wetting is not performed and the records of temperature must be retained for at least 2 years. 42 CFR § 61.145(c)(7)(iii). It is EPA's interpretation that in such cases, no written application to, or written approval by the Administrator is needed for using emission control methods listed in § 61.145(c)(3)(i)(B), or alternative emission control methods that have been previously approved by the Administrator. However, such written application or approval is required for alternative emission control methods that have not been previously approved. Any dust and debris collected from cutting must still be kept wet and placed in containers. All of the other requirements for notification and waste disposal would continue to apply as described elsewhere in this notice and the Asbestos NESHAP.
              C. Waste Collection and Handling
              3.C.1. It is EPA's interpretation that waste resulting from slicing and other methods that do not cut, grind, sand or abrade Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material is not subject to the NESHAP and can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste. EPA further construes the NESHAP to provide that if Category II roofing material (such as A/C shingles) is removed and disposed of without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, the waste from the removal is not subject to the NESHAP waste disposal requirements. EPA also interprets the NESHAP to be inapplicable to waste resulting from roof removal operations that do not meet or exceed the coverage thresholds described in section I above. Of course, other State, local, or Federal regulations may apply.

              3.C.2. It is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter, or other method that similarly damages the roofing material, is used to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the damaged material from the cut (the sawdust or debris) is considered asbestos containing waste subject to § 61.150 of the NESHAP, provided the coverage thresholds discussed above in section 1 are met or exceeded. This sawdust or debris must be disposed of at a disposal site operated in accordance with the NESHAP. It is also EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if the remainder of the roof is free of the sawdust and debris generated by the cutting, or if such sawdust or debris is collected as discussed below in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4, 3.C.5 and 3.C.6, the remainder of the roof can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste because it is considered to be Category I nonfriable material (as long as the remainder of the roof is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material). EPA further believes that if the roof is not cleaned of such sawdust or debris, i.e., it is contaminated, then it must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and be handled in accordance with § 61.150.

              3.C.3. In order to be in compliance with the NESHAP while using an RB roof cutter (or device that similarly damages the roofing material) to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the dust and debris resulting from the cutting of the roof should be collected as soon as possible after the cutting operation, and kept wet until collected and placed in leak-tight containers. EPA believes that where the blade guard completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface and is equipped with a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and the spraying device is in operation during the cutting, most of the dust and debris from cutting will be confined along the cut. The most efficient methods to collect the dust and debris from cutting are to immediately collect or vacuum up the damaged material where it lies along the cut using a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the debris as possible, or to gently sweep up the bulk of the debris, and then use a filtered vacuum cleaner that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the remainder of the debris as possible. On smooth surfaced roofs (nonaggregate roofs), sweeping up the debris and then wet wiping the surface may be done in place of using a filtered vacuum cleaner. It is EPA's view that if these decontamination procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste. Additionally, it is EPA's view that where such decontamination procedures are followed, if the remaining portions of the roof are non-asbestos or Category I nonfriable asbestos material, and if the remaining portions are removed using removal methods that slice, shear, punch or pry, as discussed in section 1.C above, then the remaining portions do not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste and the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements are not applicable to the removal of the remaining portions. In EPA's interpretation, the failure of a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector to collect larger chunks or pieces of damaged roofing material created by the RB roof cutter does not require the remaining roofing material to be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste, provided that such visible chunks or pieces of roofing material are collected (e.g. by gentle sweeping) and disposed of as asbestos waste. Other methods of decontamination may not be adequate, and should be approved by the local delegated agency.
              3.C.4. In EPA's interpretation, if the debris from the cutting is not collected immediately, it will be necessary to lightly mist the dust or debris, until it is collected, as discussed above, and placed in containers. The dust or debris should be lightly misted frequently enough to prevent the material from drying, and to prevent airborne emissions, prior to collection as described above. It is EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if these procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste, as long as the remaining roof material is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material.

              3.C.5. It is EPA's interpretation that, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided the roofing material has not been made friable by the cutting operation, the appearance of rough, jagged or damaged edges on the remaining roofing material, due to the use of an RB roof cutter, does not require that such remaining roofing material be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste. In addition, it is also EPA's interpretation that if the sawdust or debris generated by the use of an RB roof cutter has been collected as discussed in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4 and 3.C.6, the presence of dust along the edge of the remaining roof material does not render such material “friable” for purposes of this interpretive rule or the NESHAP, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided that the remaining roofing material near the cutline has not been made friable by the cutting operation. Where roofing material near the cutline has been made friable by the use of the RB cutter (i.e. where such remaining roofing material near the cutline can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder using hand pressure), it is EPA's interpretation that the use of an encapsulant will ensure that such friable material need not be treated or disposed of as asbestos containing waste material. The encapsulant may be applied to the friable material after the roofing material has been collected into stacks for subsequent disposal as nonasbestos waste. It is EPA's view that if the encapsulation procedure set forth in this paragraph is followed in operations where roofing material near the cutline has been rendered friable by the use of an RB roof cutter, and if the decontamination procedures set forth in paragraph 3.C.3 have been followed, the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements would be met for the removal, handling and disposal of the remaining roofing material.
              3.C.6. As one way to comply with the NESHAP, the dust and debris from cutting can be placed in leak-tight containers, such as plastic bags, and the containers labeled using warning labels required by OSHA (29 CFR 1926.58). In addition, the containers must have labels that identify the waste generator (such as the name of the roofing contractor, abatement contractor, and/or building owner or operator) and the location of the site at which the waste was generated.
              IV. Waste Disposal
              A. Disposal Requirements
              4.A.1. Section 61.150(b) requires that, as soon as is practical, all collected dust and debris from cutting as well as any contaminated roofing squares, must be taken to a landfill that is operated in accordance with § 61.154 or to an EPA-approved site that converts asbestos waste to nonasbestos material in accordance with § 61.155. During the loading and unloading of affected waste, asbestos warning signs must be affixed to the vehicles.
              B. Waste Shipment Record
              4.B.1. For each load of asbestos waste that is regulated under the NESHAP, a waste shipment record (WSR) must be maintained in accordance with § 61.150(d). Information that must be maintained for each waste load includes the following:
              • Name, address, and telephone number of the waste generator
              • Name and address of the local, State, or EPA regional office responsible for administering the asbestos NESHAP program
              • Quantity of waste in cubic meters (or cubic yards)
              • Name and telephone number of the disposal site operator
              • Name and physical site location of the disposal site
              • Date transported
              • Name, address, and telephone number of the transporter(s)

              • Certification that the contents meet all government regulations for transport by highways.
              
              4.B.2. The waste generator is responsible for ensuring that a copy of the WSR is delivered to the disposal site along with the waste shipment. If a copy of the WSR signed by the disposal site operator is not returned to the waste generator within 35 days, the waste generator must contact the transporter and/or the disposal site to determine the status of the waste shipment. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(3). If the signed WSR is not received within 45 days, the waste generator must report, in writing, to the responsible NESHAP program agency and send along a copy of the WSR. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(4). Copies of WSRs, including those signed by the disposal site operator, must be retained for at least 2 years. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(5).
              V. Training
              5.1. For those roof removals that are subject to the NESHAP, at least one on-site supervisor trained in the provisions of the NESHAP must be present during the removal of the asbestos roofing material. 40 CFR 61.145(c)(8). In EPA's view, this person can be a job foreman, a hired consultant, or someone who can represent the building owner or contractor responsible for the removal. In addition to the initial training requirement, a refresher training course is required every 2 years. The NESHAP training requirements became effective on November 20, 1991.
              5.2. Asbestos training courses developed specifically to address compliance with the NESHAP in roofing work, as well as courses developed for other purposes can satisfy this requirement of the NESHAP, as long as the course covers the areas specified in the regulation. EPA believes that Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) training courses will, for example, satisfy the NESHAP training requirements. However, nothing in this interpretive rule or in the NESHAP shall be deemed to require that roofing contractors or roofing workers performing operations covered by the NESHAP must be trained or accredited under AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). Likewise, state or local authorities may independently impose additional training, licensing, or accreditation requirements on roofing contractors performing operations covered by the NESHAP, but such additional training, licensing or accreditation is not called for by this interpretive rule or the federal NESHAP.
              5.3. For removal of Category I asbestos containing roofing material where RB roof cutters or equipment that similarly damages the asbestos-containing roofing material are used, the NESHAP training requirements (§ 61.145(c)(8)) apply as discussed in Section I above. It is EPA's intention that removal of Category I asbestos-containing roofing material using hatchets, axes, knives, and/or the use of spud bars, pry bars and shovels to lift the roofing material, or similar removal methods that slice, punch, or shear the roof membrane are not subject to the training requirements, since these methods do not cause the roof removal to be subject to the NESHAP. Likewise, it is EPA's intention that roof removal operations involving Category II nonfriable ACM are not subject to the training requirements where such operations are not subject to the NESHAP as discussed in section I above.

              Applicability and designation of source.
              (a) The source to which this subpart applies is each glass melting furnace that uses commercial arsenic as a raw material. This subpart does not apply to pot furnaces.
              (b) Rebricking is not considered construction or modification for the purposes of § 61.05(a).
            
            
              § 61.161
              Definitions.
              The terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in § 61.02, or in this section as follows:
              
                Arsenic-containing glass type means any glass that is distinguished from other glass solely by the weight percent of arsenic added as a raw material and by the weight percent of arsenic in the glass produced. Any two or more glasses that have the same weight percent of arsenic in the raw materials as well as in the glass produced shall be considered to belong to one arsenic-containing glass type, without regard to the recipe used or any other characteristics of the glass or the method of production.
              
                By-pass the control device means to operate the glass melting furnace without operating the control device to which that furnace's emissions are directed routinely.
              
                Commercial arsenic means any form of arsenic that is produced by extraction from any arsenic-containing substance and is intended for sale or for intentional use in a manufacturing process. Arsenic that is a naturally occurring trace constituent of another substance is not considered “commercial arsenic.”
              
                Cullet means waste glass recycled to a glass melting furnace.
              
                Glass melting furnace means a unit comprising a refractory vessel in which raw materials are charged, melted at high temperature, refined, and conditioned to produce molten glass. The unit includes foundations, superstructure and retaining walls, raw material charger systems, heat exchangers, melter cooling system, exhaust system, refractory brick work, fuel supply and electrical boosting equipment, integral control systems and instrumentation, and appendages for conditioning and distributing molten glass to forming apparatuses. The forming apparatuses, including the float bath used in flat glass manufacturing, are not considered part of the glass melting furnace.
              
                Glass produced means the glass pulled from the glass melting furnace.
              
                Inorganic arsenic means the oxides and other noncarbon compounds of the element arsenic included in particulate matter, vapors, and aerosols.
              
                Malfunction means any sudden failure of air pollution control equipment or process equipment or of a process to operate in a normal or usual manner so that emissions of arsenic are increased.
              
                Pot furnace means a glass melting furnace that contains one or more refractory vessels in which glass is melted by indirect heating. The openings of the vessels are in the outside wall of the furnace and are covered with refractory stoppers during melting.
              
                Rebricking means cold replacement of damaged or worn refractory parts of the glass melting furnace. Rebricking includes replacement of the refractories comprising the bottom, sidewalls, or roof of the melting vessel; replacement of refractory work in the heat exchanger; and replacement of refractory portions of the glass conditioning and distribution system.
              
                Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source for any purpose.
              
                Theoretical arsenic emissions factor means the amount of inorganic arsenic, expressed in grams per kilogram of glass produced, as determined based on a material balance.
              
                Uncontrolled total arsenic emissions means the total inorganic arsenic in the glass melting furnace exhaust gas preceding any add-on emission control device.

              Emission limits.
              (a) The owner or operator of an existing glass melting furnace subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section; except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (1) Uncontrolled total arsenic emissions from the glass melting furnace shall be less than 2.5 Mg (2.7 ton) per year, or
              (2) Total arsenic emissions from the glass melting furnace shall be conveyed to a control device and reduced by at least 85 percent.
              (b) The owner or operator of a new or modified glass melting furnace subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (1) Uncontrolled total arsenic emissions from the glass melting furnace shall be less than 0.4 Mg (0.44 ton) per year, or
              (2) Total arsenic emissions from the glass melting furnace shall be conveyed to a control device and reduced by at least 85 percent.
              (c) An owner or operator of a source subject to the requirements of this section may, after approval by the Administrator, bypass the control device to which arsenic emissions from the furnace are directed for a limited period of time for designated purposes such as maintenance of the control device, as specified in § 61.165(e).

              (d) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator of a glass melting furnace subject to the provisions of this subpart shall operate and maintain the furnace and associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions of inorganic arsenic to the atmosphere to the maximum extent practicable. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, inspection of the source, and review of other records.

              § 61.172
              Standard for new and existing sources.
              (a) The provisions of paragraphs (b)-(f) of this section do not apply to any copper converter at a facility where the total arsenic charging rate for the copper converter department averaged over a 1-year period is less than 75 kg/hr (165 lb/hr), as determined under § 61.174(f).
              (b) The owner or operator of each copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall reduce inorganic arsenic emissions to the atmosphere by meeting the following design, equipment, work practice, and operational requirements:
              (1) Install, operate, and maintain a secondary hood system on each copper converter. Each secondary hood system shall consist of a hood enclosure, air curtain fan(s), exhaust system fan(s), and ductwork that conveys the captured emissions to a control device, and shall meet the following specifications:
              (i) The configuration and dimensions of the hood enclosure shall be such that the copper converter mouth, charging ladles, skimming ladles, and any other material transfer vessels used will be housed within the confines or influence of the hood enclosure during each mode of copper converter operation.
              (ii) The back of the hood enclosure shall be fully enclosed and sealed against the primary hood. Portions of the side-walls in contact with the copper converter shall be sealed against the converter.
              (iii) Openings in the top and front of the hood enclosure to allow for the entry and egress of ladles and crane appartus shall be minimized to the fullest extent practicable.
              (iv) The hood enclosure shall be fabricated in such a manner and of materials of sufficient strength to withstand incidental contact with ladles and crane apparatus with no significant damage.
              (v) One side-wall of the hood enclosure shall be equipped with a horizontal-slotted plenum along the top, and the opposite side-wall shall be equipped with an exhaust hood. The horizontal-slotted plenum shall be designed to allow the distance from the base to the top of the horizontal slot to be adjustable up to a dimension of 76 mm.
              (vi) The horizontal-slotted plenum shall be connected to a fan. When activated, the fan shall push air through the horizontal slot, producing a horizontal air curtain above the copper converter that is directed to the exhaust hood. The fan power output installed shall be sufficient to overcome static pressure losses through the ductwork upstream of the horizontal-slotted plenum and across the plenum, and to deliver at least 22,370 watts (30 air horsepower) at the horizontal-slotted plenum discharge.
              (vii) The exhaust hood shall be sized to completely intercept the airstream from the horizontal-slotted plenum combined with the additional airflow resulting from entrainment of the surrounding air. The exhaust hood shall be connected to a fan. When activated, the fan shall pull the combined airstream into the exhaust hood.
              (viii) The entire secondary hood system shall be equipped with dampers and instrumentation, as appropriate, so that the desired air curtain and exhaust flow are maintained during each mode of copper converter operation.
              (2) Optimize the capture of secondary inorganic arsenic emissions by operating the copper converter and secondary hood system at all times as follows:
              (i) Copper converter. (A) Increase the air curtain and exhaust flow rates to their optimum conditions prior to raising the primary hood and rolling the copper converter out for charging, skimming, or pouring.
              
              (B) Once rolled out, prior to the commencement of skimming or pouring, hold the copper converter in an idle position until fuming from the molten bath has been minimized.
              (C) During skimming, raise the receiving ladle off the ground and position the ladle as close to the copper converter mouth as possible to minimize the drop distance between the converter mouth and the receiving ladle.
              (D) Control the rate of flow into the receiving ladle to the extent practicable to minimize fuming.
              (E) Upon the completion of each charge, withdraw the charging ladle or vessel used from the confines of the secondary hood in a slow, deliberate manner.
              (F) During charging, skimming, or pouring, ensure that the crane block does not disturb the air flow between the horizontal-slotted plenum and the exhaust hood.
              (ii) Secondary hood system. (A) Operate the secondary hood system under conditions that will result in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions.
              (B) Within 30 days after the effective date of this subpart, or within 30 days after the initial operation of each secondary hood system, whichever comes later, provide to the Administrator a list of operating conditions for the secondary hood system that will result in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions. This list shall specify the operating parameters for the following:
              (1) The dimensions of the horizontal slot.
              (2) The velocity of air through the horizontal slot during each mode of converter operation.

              (4) The face velocity at the opening of the exhaust hood during each mode of converter operation.
              (C) Operate the secondary hood system under the conditions listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.
              (D) Notify the Administrator in writing within 30 days if there is any change in the operating conditions submitted pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) that will result in any reduction in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions.
              (3) Comply with the following inspection and maintenance requirements after installing the secondary hood system required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
              (i) At least once every month, visually inspect the components of the secondary hood system that are exposed to potential damage from crane and ladle operation, including the hood enclosure, side- and back-wall hood seals, and the horizontal slot.
              (ii) Replace or repair any defective or damaged components of the secondary hood system within 30 days after discovering the defective or damaged components.
              (c) No owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause or allow to be discharged into the atmosphere any copper converter secondary emissions that exit from a control device and contain particulate matter in excess of 11.6 mg/dscm (0.0051 gr/dscf).
              (d) The owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall submit a description of a plan for control of inorganic arsenic emissions from the copper converter and associated air pollution control equipment. This plan shall be submitted within 90 days after the effective date of this subpart, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11. If a waiver of compliance is granted, the plan shall be submitted on a date set by the Administrator. Approval of the plan will be granted by the Administrator provided he finds that:
              (1) It includes a systematic procedure for identifying malfunctions and for reporting them immediately to smelter supervisory personnel.
              (2) It specifies the procedures that will be followed to ensure that equipment or process breakdowns due entirely or in part to poor maintenance or other preventable conditions do not occur.

              (3) It specifies the measures that will be taken to ensure compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              
              (e) The owner or operator shall implement the plan required under paragraph (d) of this section unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.
              (f) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall operate and maintain the converter and associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions of inorganic arsenic to the atmosphere to the maximum extent practicable. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, inspection of the source, and review of other records.

              § 61.203
              Radon monitoring and compliance procedures.
              (a) Within sixty days following the date on which a stack becomes an inactive stack, or within ninety days after the date on which this subpart first took effect if a stack was already inactive on that date, each owner or operator of an inactive phosphogypsum stack shall test the stack for radon-222 flux in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 115. EPA shall be notified at least 30 days prior to each such emissions test so that EPA may, at its option, observe the test. If meteorological conditions are such that a test cannot be properly conducted, then the owner or operator shall notify EPA and test as soon as conditions permit.
              (b)(1) Within ninety days after the testing is required, the owner or operator shall provide EPA with a report detailing the actions taken and the results of the radon-222 flux testing. Each report shall also include the following information:
              (i) The name and location of the facility;
              (ii) A list of the stacks at the facility including the size and dimensions of each stack;
              (iii) The name of the person responsible for the operation of the facility and the name of the person preparing the report (if different);
              (iv) A description of the control measures taken to decrease the radon flux from the source and any actions taken to insure the long term effectiveness of the control measures; and
              (v) The results of the testing conducted, including the results of each measurement.

              (2) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer in charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately above the signature line: “I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted herein and based on may inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.”
              (c) If the owner or operator of an inactive stack chooses to conduct measurements over a one year period as permitted by Method 115 in appendix B to part 61, within ninety days after the testing commences the owner or operator shall provide EPA with an initial report, including the results of the first measurement period and a schedule for all subsequent measurements. An additional report containing all the information in § 61.203(b) shall be submitted within ninety days after completion of the final measurements.
              (d) If at any point an owner or operator of a stack once again uses an inactive stack for the disposal of phosphogypsum or for water management, the stack ceases to be in inactive status and the owner or operator must notify EPA in writing within 45 days. When the owner or operator ceases to use the stack for disposal of phosphogypsum or water management, the stack will once again become inactive and the owner or operator must satisfy again all testing and reporting requirements for inactive stacks.
              (e) If an owner or operator removes phosphogypsum from an inactive stack, the owner shall test the stack in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 115. The stack shall be tested within ninety days of the date that the owner or operator first removes phosphogypsum from the stack, and the test shall be repeated at least once during each calendar year that the owner or operator removes additional phosphogypsum from the stack.

              § 61.207
              Radium-226 sampling and measurement procedures.
              (a) Before removing phosphogypsum from a stack for distribution in commerce pursuant to § 61.204, or § 61.206, the owner or operator of a phosphogypsum stack shall measure the average radium-226 concentration at the location in the stack from which phosphogypsum will be removed. Measurements shall be performed for each such location prior to the initial distribution in commerce of phosphogypsum removed from that location and at least once during each calendar year while distribution of phosphogypsum removed from the location continues.

              (1) A minimum of 30 phosphogypsum samples shall be taken at regularly spaced intervals across the surface of the location on the stack from which the phosphogypsum will be removed. Let n
                1 represent the number of samples taken.

              (2) Measure the radium-226 concentration of each of the n
                1 samples in accordance with the analytical procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 114.
              (3) Calculate the mean, x
                
                1, and the standard deviation, s
                1, of the n
                1 radium-226 concentrations:
              
                ER03FE99.054
              
              
                Where x
                  
                  1 and s
                  1 are expressed in pCi/g.
              
              

              (4) Calculate the 95th percentile for the distribution, x
                *, using the following equation:
              
                ER03FE99.055
              
              
                Where x
                  * is expressed in pCi/g.
              
              
              (5) If the purpose for removing phosphogypsum from a stack is for distribution to commerce pursuant to § 61.206, the owner or operator of a phosphogypsum stack shall report the mean, standard deviation, 95th percentile and sample size. If the purpose for removing phosphogypsum from a stack is for distribution to commerce pursuant to § 61.204, the additional sampling procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall apply.
              (b) Based on the values for x
                
                1 and x

                * calculated in paragraphs paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, determine which of the following conditions will be met:
              
              (1) If x
                
                1 <10 pCi/g and x
                * ≤10 pCi/g; phosphogypsum may be removed from this area of the stack for distribution in commerce pursuant to § 61.204.
              (2) If x
                
                1, <10 pCi/g and x
                * >10 pCi/g, the owner or operator may elect to follow the procedures for further sampling set forth in paragraph (c) of this section:
              (3) If x
                
                1 ≥10 pCi/g; phosphogypsum shall not be removed from this area of the stack for distribution in commerce pursuant to § 61.204.
              (c) If the owner or operator elects to conduct further sampling to determine if phosphogypsum can be removed from this area of the stack, the following procedure shall apply. The objective of the following procedure is to demonstrate, with a 95% probability, that the phosphogypsum from this area of the stack has a radium-226 concentration no greater than 10 pCi/g. The procedure is iterative, the sample size may have to be increased more than one time; otherwise the phosphogypsum cannot be removed from this area of the stack for distribution to commerce pursuant to § 61.204.
              (1)(i) Solve the following equation for the total number of samples required:
              
                ER03FE99.056
              
              (ii) The sample size n
                2 shall be rounded upwards to the next whole number. The number of additional samples needed is n
                A = n
                2−n
                1.

              (2) Obtain the necessary number of additional samples, n
                A, which shall also be taken at regularly spaced intervals across the surface of the location on the stack from which phosphogypsum will be removed.

              (3) Measure the radium-226 concentration of each of the n
                A additional samples in accordance with the analytical procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 114.

              (4) Recalculate the mean and standard deviation of the entire set of n
                2 radium-226 concentrations by joining this set of n
                A concentrations with the n
                1 concentrations previously measured. Use the formulas in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, substituting the entire set of n
                2 samples in place of the n
                1 samples called for in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, thereby determining the mean, x
                
                2, and standard deviation, s
                2, for the entire set of n
                2 concentrations.

              (5) Repeat the procedure described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, substituting the recalculated mean, x
                
                2, for x
                
                1, the recalculated standard deviation, s
                2, for s
                1, and total sample size, n
                2, for n
                1.

              (6) Repeat the procedure described in paragraph (b) of this section, substituting the recalculated mean, x
                
                2 for x

              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here have the meanings given them in the Clean Air Act or subpart A of part 61. The following terms shall have the following specific meanings:
              (a) Long term stabilization means the addition of material on a uranium mill tailings pile for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR 192.02(a). These actions shall be considered complete when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determines that the requirements of 40 CFR 192.02(a) have been met.
              (b) Operational means a uranium mill tailings pile that is licensed to accept additional tailings, and those tailings can be added without violating subpart W or any other Federal, state or local rule or law. A pile cannot be considered operational if it is filled to capacity or the mill it accepts tailings from has been dismantled or otherwise decommissioned.
              (c) Residual radioactive materials shall have the same meaning as in section 101(7) of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, 42 U.S.C. 7911(7).
              (d) Tailings shall have the same meaning as in section 101(8) of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, 42 U.S.C. 7911(8).
              (e) In significant part means in a manner that is not reasonably expected to materially (i.e., more than de minimis) interfere with compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s flux standard as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility (including factors beyond the control of the licensee).

              Compliance procedures.
              (a) Sixty days following the completion of covering the pile to limit radon emissions but prior to the long term stabilization of the pile, the owners or operators of uranium mill tailings shall conduct testing for all piles within the facility in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 115, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval.
              (b) Ninety days after the testing is required, each facility shall provide EPA with a report detailing the actions taken and the results of the radon-222 flux testing. EPA shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test so that EPA may, at its option, observe the test. If meteorological conditions are such that a test cannot be properly conducted, then the owner or operator shall notify EPA and test as soon as conditions permit. Each report shall also include the following information:
              (1) The name and location of the facility.
              
              (2) A list of the piles at the facility.
              (3) A description of the control measures taken to decrease the radon flux from the source and any actions taken to insure the long term effectiveness of the control measures.
              (4) The results of the testing conducted, including the results of each measurement.

              (5) Each report shall be signed and dated by a public official in charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately above the signature line:
              
              
                I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information. I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See 18 U.S.C. 1001.
              
              
              (c) If year long measurements are made in accordance with Method 115 of appendix B of part 61, this report shall include the results of the first measurement period and provide a schedule for the measurement frequency to be used. An additional report shall be submitted ninety days after completion of the final measurements.
              (d) If long term stabilization has begun before the effective date of the rule then testing may be conducted at any time, up to 60 days after the long term stabilization is completed.
              (e) If the testing demonstrates that the pile meets the requirement of § 61.222(a) and long term stabilization has been completed then the pile is considered disposed for purposes of this rule.

              Reconsideration of rescission and reinstatement of this subpart.
              (a) Reinstatement of this subpart upon completion of reconsideration of rescission. (1) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record, that NRC or an affected Agreement State has:
              (i) Failed on a programmatic basis to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) (i.e., contained in the license) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 2-s flux standard; and
              (ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 2-s flux standard at the uranium mill tailings disposal site.

              (2) The Administrator shall reinstate 40 CFR part 61, subpart T on a site-specific basis as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State if the Administrator determines by rulemaking, based on the record:
              
              (i) That NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed in significant part on a site-specific basis to achieve compliance by the operator of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States; and
              (ii) Those failures may reasonably be anticipated to significantly interfere (i.e., more than de minimis) with the timely emplacement of a permanent radon barrier constructed to achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 2-s flux standard at the uranium mill tailings disposal site.
              (3) Upon completion of the reconsideration of rescission pursuant to § 61.226(c) the Administrator may issue a finding that reinstatement of this subpart is not appropriate if the Administrator finds:
              (i) NRC and the affected Agreement States are on a programmatic basis implementing and enforcing, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) (i.e., contained in the license) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 2-s flux standard; or
              (ii) NRC or an affected Agreement State are on a site-specific basis, in significant part, achieving compliance by the operator of the site or sites with applicable license requirements, regulations, or standards implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States.
              (b) Procedures to petition for reconsideration of rescission of this subpart. (1) A person may petition the Administrator to reconsider the rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(a).
              (2) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(a)(1) (programmatic basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner demonstrates that written notice of the alleged failure(s) was provided to NRC at least 60 days before filing the petition with EPA. This notification shall include a statement of the grounds for such a petition and this notice requirement may be satisfied by, but is not limited to, submissions or pleadings submitted to NRC during a proceeding conducted by NRC.
              (3) EPA shall summarily dismiss a petition to reconsider rescission and seek reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(a)(2) (site-specific basis), without prejudice, unless the petitioner demonstrates that a written request was made to NRC or an affected Agreement State for enforcement or other relief at least 60 days before filing its petition with EPA, and unless the petitioner alleges that NRC or the affected Agreement State failed to respond to such request by taking action, as necessary, to assure timely implementation and enforcement of the 20 pCi/m 2-s flux standard.
              (4) Upon receipt of a petition under § 61.226(b)(1) that is not dismissed under § 61.226(b)(2) or (b)(3), EPA will propose to grant or deny an authorized petition to reconsider, take comments on the Agency's proposed action, and take final action granting or denying such petition to reconsider within 300 days of receipt.
              (c) Reconsideration of rescission of this subpart initiated by the Administrator. (1) The Administrator may initiate reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart as applied to owners and operators of non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites if EPA has reason to believe that NRC or an affected Agreement State has failed to implement and enforce, in significant part, the regulations governing the disposal of uranium mill tailings promulgated by EPA and NRC or the tailings closure plan (radon) requirements establishing milestones for the purpose of emplacing a permanent radon barrier that will achieve compliance with the 20 pCi/m 2-s flux standard.
              (2) Before the Administrator initiates reconsideration of the rescission and reinstatement of this subpart under § 61.226(c)(1), EPA shall consult with NRC to address EPA's concerns and if the consultation does not resolve the concerns, EPA shall provide NRC with 60 days notice of the Agency's intent to initiate rulemaking to reinstate this subpart.

              (2) If an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured, a leak is detected.
              (3) The leak percentage shall be determined by dividing the number of valves in VHAP service for which leaks are detected by the number of valves in VHAP service within the process unit.
              (d) Owner or operators who elect to have all valves comply with this alternative standard shall not have a process unit with a leak percentage greater than 2.0 percent.
              (e) If an owner or operator decides no longer to comply with § 61.243-1, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator in writing that the work practice standard described in § 61.242-7(a)-(e) will be followed.
            
            
              § 61.243-2
              Alternative standards for valves in VHAP service—skip period leak detection and repair.
              (a)(1) An owner or operator may elect for all valves within a process unit to comply with one of the alternative work practices specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.
              (2) An owner or operator must notify the Administrator before implementing one of the alternative work practices, as specified in § 61.247(d).

              § 61.244
              Alternative means of emission limitation.
              (a) Permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation under section 112(e)(3) of the Clean Air Act shall be governed by the following procedures:
              (b) Where the standard is an equipment, design, or operational requirement:
              (1) Each owner or operator applying for permission shall be responsible for collecting and verifying test data for an alternative means of emission limitation to test data for the equipment, design, and operational requirements.
              (2) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements that may be necessary to assure operation and maintenance to achieve the same emission reduction as the equipment, design, and operational requirements.
              (c) Where the standard is a work practice:
              (1) Each owner or operator applying for permission shall be responsible for collecting and verifying test data for an alternative means of emission limitation.
              (2) For each source for which permission is requested, the emission reduction achieved by the required work practices shall be demonstrated for a minimum period of 12 months.
              (3) For each source for which permission is requested, the emission reduction achieved by the alternative means of emission limitation shall be demonstrated.
              (4) Each owner or operator applying for permission shall commit in writing each source to work practices that provide for emission reductions equal to or greater than the emission reductions achieved by the required work practices.
              (5) The Administrator will compare the demonstrated emission reduction for the alternative means of emission limitation to the demonstrated emission reduction for the required work practices and will consider the commitment in paragraph (c)(4).
              (6) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements that may be necessary to assure operation and maintenance to achieve the same emission reduction as the required work practices of this subpart.
              (d) An owner or operator may offer a unique approach to demonstrate the alternative means of emission limitation.
              (e)(1) Manufacturers of equipment used to control equipment leaks of a VHAP may apply to the Administrator for permission for an alternative means of emission limitation that achieves a reduction in emissions of the VHAP achieved by the equipment, design, and operational requirements of this subpart.
              (2) The Administrator will grant permission according to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d).

              § 61.245
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the test methods and procedures requirements provided in this section.
              (b) Monitoring, as required in §§ 61.242, 61.243, 61.244, and 61.135, shall comply with the following requirements:
              (1) Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.
              (2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21.
              (3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21.
              (4) Calibration gases shall be:
              (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); and

              (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane.
              (5) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in Method 21.
              (c) When equipment is tested for compliance with or monitored for no detectable emissions, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements:
              (1) The requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) shall apply.
              (2) The background level shall be determined, as set forth in Method 21.
              (3) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in Method 21.
              (4) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 500 ppm for determining compliance.
              (d)(1) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can conceivably contain equipment in VHAP service is presumed to be in VHAP service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in VHAP service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in VHAP service, it must be determined that the percent VHAP content can be reasonably expected never to exceed 10 percent by weight. For purposes of determining the percent VHAP content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, procedures that conform to the methods described in ASTM Method D-2267 (incorporated by the reference as specified in § 61.18) shall be used.
              (2)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to demonstrate that the percent VHAP content does not exceed 10 percent by weight, provided that the engineering judgment demonstrates that the VHAP content clearly does not exceed 10 percent by weight. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in VHAP service, however, the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
              (ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in VHAP service, the determination can be revised only after following the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
              (3) Samples used in determining the percent VHAP content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment or the gas being combusted in the flare.
              (e)(1) Method 22 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine compliance of flares with the visible emission provisions of this subpart.
              (2) The presence of a flare pilot flame shall be monitored using a thermocouple or any other equivalent device to detect the presence of a flame.
              (3) The net heating value of the gas being combusted in a flare shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                EC15NO91.055
              
              
                Where:
                
                HT = Net heating value of the sample, MJ/scm (BTU/scf); where the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg (77 °F and 14.7 psi), but the standard temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 °C (68 °F).
                K = conversion constant, 1.740 × 10 7 (g-mole) (MJ)/(ppm-scm-kcal) (metric units); or 4.674 × 108 ((g-mole) (Btu)/(ppm-scf-kcal)) (English units)
                Ci = Concentration of sample component “i” in ppm, as measured by Method 18 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 and ASTM D2504-67, 77, or 88 (Reapproved 1993) (incorporated by reference as specified in § 61.18).
                Hi = net heat of combustion of sample component “i” at 25 °C and 760 mm Hg (77 °F and 14.7 psi), kcal/g-mole. The heats of combustion may be determined using ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 61.18) if published values are not available or cannot be calculated.
              
              

              (4) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by dividing the volumetric flowrate (in units of standard temperature and pressure), as determined by Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, by the unobstructed (free) cross section area of the flare tip.
              
              (5) The maximum permitted velocity, Vmax, for air-assisted flares shall be determined by the following equation:
              
                ER17OC00.487

                Vmax = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec (ft/sec).
                HT = Net heating value of the gas being combusted, as determined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, MJ/scm (Btu/scf).
                K1 = 8.706 m/sec (metric units)
                = 28.56 ft/sec (English units)
                K2 = 0.7084 m4/(MJ-sec) (metric units)

              54 FR 51703, Dec. 15, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 61.250
              Designation of facilities.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to owners or operators of facilities licensed to manage uranium byproduct materials during and following the processing of uranium ores, commonly referred to as uranium mills and their associated tailings. This subpart does not apply to the disposal of tailings.
            
            
              § 61.251
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act or 40 CFR part 61, subpart A. The following terms shall have the following specific meanings:
              (a) Area means the vertical projection of the pile upon the earth's surface.
              (b) Continuous disposal means a method of uranium byproduct material or tailings management and disposal in which uranium byproduct material or tailings are dewatered by mechanical methods immediately after generation. The dried uranium byproduct material or tailings are then placed in trenches or other disposal areas and immediately covered to limit emissions consistent with applicable Federal standards.
              (c) Dewatered means to remove the water from recently produced uranium byproduct material or tailings by mechanical or evaporative methods such that the water content of the uranium byproduct material or tailings does not exceed 30 percent by weight.
              (d) Existing conventional impoundment means any conventional uranium byproduct material or tailings impoundment which is licensed to accept additional uranium byproduct material or tailings and is in existence on December 15, 1989.
              (e) Operation. Operation means that an impoundment is being used for the continued placement of uranium byproduct material or tailings or is in standby status for such placement. An impoundment is in operation from the day that uranium byproduct material or tailings are first placed in the impoundment until the day that final closure begins.
              (f) Phased disposal means a method of uranium byproduct material or tailings management and disposal which uses lined impoundments which are filled and then immediately dried and covered to meet all applicable Federal standards.
              (g) Uranium byproduct material or tailings means the waste produced by the extraction or concentration of uranium from any ore processed primarily for its source material content. Ore bodies depleted by uranium solution extraction and which remain underground do not constitute byproduct material for the purposes of this subpart.
              (h) Conventional impoundment. A conventional impoundment is a permanent structure located at any uranium recovery facility which contains mostly solid uranium byproduct material or tailings from the extraction of uranium from uranium ore. These impoundments are left in place at facility closure.
              (i) Non-conventional impoundment. A non-conventional impoundment is used for managing liquids from uranium recovery operations and contains uranium byproduct material or tailings suspended in and/or covered by liquids. These structures are commonly known as holding ponds or evaporation ponds and can be located at any uranium recovery facility. They are typically not permanent structures unless they transition to become used as conventional impoundments. Impoundments constructed for the purpose of managing liquids from closure or remediation activities (e.g., contaminated groundwater), and which are used solely for that purpose, are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
              (j) Heap leach pile. A heap leach pile is a pile of uranium ore placed on an engineered structure and stacked so as to allow uranium to be dissolved and removed by leaching liquids.
              (k) Standby. Standby means the period of time that an impoundment is not accepting uranium byproduct material or tailings but has not yet entered final closure.
              (l) Uranium recovery facility. A uranium recovery facility means a facility licensed by the NRC or an NRC Agreement State to manage uranium byproduct material or tailings during and following the processing of uranium ores. Common names for these facilities are a conventional uranium mill, an in-situ leach (or recovery) facility and a heap leach facility or pile.
              (m) Heap leach pile operational life. The operational life of a heap leach pile means the time period from the first time that lixiviant is placed on the heap leach pile until the time the final rinse is completed.
              (n) Final closure means the period during which an impoundment or heap leach pile is being managed in accordance with the milestones and requirements in an approved reclamation plan. Final closure for the impoundment or heap leach pile begins when the owner or operator provides written notice to the Administrator and to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or applicable NRC Agreement State that:
              (1) A conventional impoundment is no longer receiving uranium byproduct material or tailings, is no longer on standby for such receipt and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that impoundment or facility closure plan; or
              (2) A non-conventional impoundment is no longer required for evaporation or holding purposes, is no longer on standby for such purposes and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that impoundment or facility closure plan; or
              (3) A heap leach pile has concluded its operational life and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that pile or facility closure plan.
              (o) Reclamation plan means the plan detailing activities and milestones to accomplish reclamation of impoundments or piles containing uranium byproduct material or tailings. Activities and milestones to be addressed include, but are not limited to, dewatering and contouring of conventional impoundments and heap leach piles, and removal and disposal of non-conventional impoundments. A reclamation plan prepared and approved in accordance with 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A is considered a reclamation plan in this subpart.

              § 61.253
              Determining compliance.
              Compliance with the emission standard in this subpart shall be determined annually through the use of Method 115 of appendix B. When measurements are to be made over a one year period, EPA shall be provided with a schedule of the measurement frequency to be used. The schedule may be submitted to EPA prior to or after the first measurement period. EPA shall be notified 30 days prior to any emissions test so that EPA may, at its option, observe the test.
            
            
              § 61.254
              Annual reporting requirements.
              (a) The owners or operators of operating existing mill impoundments shall report the results of the compliance calculations required in § 61.253 and the input parameters used in making the calculation for each calendar year shall be sent to EPA by March 31 of the following year. Each report shall also include the following information:
              (1) The name and location of the mill.
              (2) The name of the person responsible for the operation of the facility and the name of the person preparing the report (if different).
              (3) The results of the testing conducted, including the results of each measurement.
              (4) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer in charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately above the signature line: “I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.”
              (b) If the facility is not in compliance with the emission limits of § 61.252 in the calendar year covered by the report, then the facility must commence reporting to the Administrator on a monthly basis the information listed in paragraph (a) of this section, for the preceding month. These reports will start the month immediately following the submittal of the annual report for the year in noncompliance and will be due 30 days following the end of each month. This increased level of reporting will continue until the Administrator has determined that the monthly reports are no longer necessary. In addition to all the information required in paragraph (a) of this section, monthly reports shall also include the following information:
              (1) All controls or other changes in operation of the facility that will be or are being installed to bring the facility into compliance.
              (2) If the facility is under a judicial or administrative enforcement decree, the report will describe the facilities performance under the terms of the decree.
              (c) The first report will cover the emissions of calendar year 1990.
            
            
              
              § 61.255
              Recordkeeping requirements.
              (a) The owner or operator of any uranium recovery facility must maintain records that confirm that the conventional impoundment(s), non-conventional impoundment(s) and heap leach pile(s) subject to this subpart at the facility meet the requirements in 40 CFR 192.32(a)(1). These records shall include, but not be limited to, the results of liner compatibility tests.
              (b) The owner or operator of any uranium recovery facility with non-conventional impoundments must maintain written records from daily inspections and other records confirming that any sediments have remained saturated in the non-conventional impoundments at the facility. Periodic digital photographic evidence, with embedded date stamp and other identifying metadata, shall be collected no less frequently than weekly to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of § 61.252(b). Should inspection reveal that a non-conventional impoundment is not in compliance with the requirements of § 61.252(b), the owner or operator shall collect photographic evidence before and after the non-compliance is corrected.
              (c) The records required in paragraphs (a) and (b) in this section must be kept at the uranium recovery facility for the operational life of the facility and must be made available for inspection by the Administrator, or his authorized representative.

              (1) Digital photographs taken to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of § 61.252(c) shall be submitted electronically using the Subpart W Impoundment Photographic Reporting (SWIPR) system that is accessed through EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (cdx.epa.gov) at least monthly.

              § 61.271
              Emission standard.
              The owner or operator of each storage vessel with a design storage capacity greater than or equal to 38 cubic meters (10,000 gallons) to which this subpart applies shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section and with the requirements either in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, or equivalent as provided in § 61.273.
              (a) The storage vessel shall be equipped with a fixed roof and an internal floating roof.
              (1) An internal floating roof means a cover that rests on the liquid surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it) inside a storage vessel that has a permanently affixed roof. The internal floating roof shall be floating on the liquid surface at all times, except during initial fill and during those intervals when the storage vessel is completely emptied or subsequently emptied and refilled. When the roof is resting on the leg supports, the process of filling, emptying, or refilling shall be continuous and shall be accomplished as rapidly as possible.
              (2) Each internal floating roof shall be equipped with one of the closure devices listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section between the wall of the storage vessel and the edge of the internal floating roof. This requirement does not apply to each existing storage vessel for which construction of an internal floating roof equipped with a continuous seal commenced on or before July 28, 1988. A continuous seal means a seal that forms a continuous closure that completely covers the space between the wall of the storage vessel and the edge of the internal floating roof.
              (i) A foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid (liquid-mounted seal). A liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid between the wall of the storage vessel and the floating roof continuously around the circumference of the vessel.
              (ii) Two seals mounted one above the other so that each forms a continuous closure that completely covers the space between the wall of the storage vessel and the edge of the internal floating roof. The lower seal may be vapor-mounted, but both must be continuous.
              (iii) A metallic shoe seal. A metallic shoe seal (also referred to as a mechanical shoe seal) is, but is not limited to, a metal sheet held vertically against the wall of the storage vessel by springs or weighted levers and is connected by braces to the floating roof. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.
              (3) Automatic bleeder vents are to be closed at all times when the roof is floating, except when the roof is being floated off or is being landed on the roof leg supports.

              (4) Each opening in a noncontact internal floating roof except for automatic bleeder vents (vacuum breaker vents) and the rim space vents is to provide a projection below the liquid surface.
              
              (5) Each internal floating roof shall meet the specifications listed below. If an existing storage vessel had an internal floating roof with a continuous seal as of July 28, 1988, the requirements listed below do not have to be met until the first time after September 14, 1989, the vessel is emptied and degassed or September 14, 1999, whichever occurs first,
              (i) Each opening in the internal floating roof except for leg sleeves, automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents, column wells, ladder wells, sample wells, and stub drains is to be equipped with a cover or lid. The cover or lid shall be equipped with a gasket. Covers on each access hatch and automatic gauge float well shall be bolted.
              (ii) Each penetration of the internal floating roof for the purposes of sampling shall be a sample well. Each sample well shall have a slit fabric cover that covers at least 90 percent of the opening.
              (iii) Each automatic bleeder vent shall be gasketed.
              (iv) Rim space vents shall be equipped with a gasket.
              (v) Each penetration of the internal floating roof that allows for passage of a ladder shall have a gasketed sliding cover.
              (vi) Each penetration of the internal floating roof that allows for passage of a column supporting the fixed roof shall have a flexible fabric sleeve seal or a gasketed sliding cover.
              (6) Each cover or lid on any opening in the internal floating roof shall be closed (i.e., no visible gaps), except when a device is in actual use Covers on each access hatch and each automatic gauge float well which are equipped with bolts shall be bolted when they are not in use. Rim space vents are to be set to open only when the internal floating roof is not floating or at the manufacturer's recommended setting.
              (b) The storage vessel shall have an external floating roof.
              (1) An external floating roof means a pontoon-type or double-deck-type cover that rests on the liquid surface in a vessel with no fixed roof.
              (2) Each external floating roof shall be equipped with a closure device between the wall of the storage vessel and the roof edge. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the closure device is to consist of two seals, one above the other. The lower seal is referred to as the primary seal and the upper seal is referred to as the secondary seal.
              (i) The primary seal shall be either a metallic shoe seal or a liquid-mounted seal. A liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid between the wall of the storage vessel and the floating roof continuously around the circumference of the vessel. A metallic shoe seal (which can also be referred to as a mechanical shoe seal) is, but is not limited to, a metal sheet held vertically against the wall of the storage vessel by springs or weighted levers and is connected by braces to the floating roof. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof. Except as provided in § 61.272(b)(4), the primary seal shall completely cover the annular space between the edge of the floating roof and the vessel wall.
              (ii) The secondary seal shall completely cover the annular space between the external floating roof and the wall of the storage vessel in a continuous fashion except as allowed in § 61.272(b)(4).

              (3) Except for automatic bleeder vents and rim space vents, each opening in the noncontact external floating roof shall provide a projection below the liquid surface. Except for automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents, roof drains, and leg sleeves, each opening in the roof is to be equipped with a gasketed cover, seal or lid which is to be maintained in a closed position at all times (i.e., no visible gap) except when the device is in actual use. Automatic bleeder vents are to be closed at all times when the roof is floating, except when the roof is being floated off or is being landed on the roof leg supports. Rim vents are to be set to open when the roof is being floated off the roof leg supports or at the manufacturer's recommended setting. Automatic bleeder vents and rim space vents are to be gasketed. Each emergency roof drain is to be provided with a slotted membrane fabric cover that covers at least 90 percent of the area of the opening.
              (4) The roof shall be floating on the liquid at all times (i.e., off the roof leg supports) except during initial fill until the roof is lifted off leg supports and when the vessel is completely emptied and subsequently refilled. The process of emptying and refilling when the roof is resting on the leg supports shall be continuous and shall be accomplished as rapidly as possible.
              (5) The requirement for a secondary seal does not apply to each existing storage vessel that was equipped with a liquid-mounted primary seal as of July 28, 1988, until after the first time after September 14, 1989, when the vessel is emptied and degassed or 10 years from September 14, 1989, whichever occurs first.
              (c) The storage vessel shall be equipped with a closed vent system and a control device.
              (1) The closed vent system shall be designed to collect all benzene vapors and gases discharged from the storage vessel and operated with no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background and visual inspections, as determined in § 61.242-11 (subpart V).
              (2) The control device shall be designed and operated to reduce inlet benzene emissions by 95 percent or greater. If a flare is used as the control device, it shall meet the specifications described in the general control device requirements of 40 CFR 60.18.
              (3) The specifications and requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section for closed vent systems and control devices do not apply during periods of routine maintenance. During periods of routine maintenance, the benzene level in the storage vessel(s) serviced by the control device subject to the provisions of § 61.271(c) may be lowered but not raised. Periods of routine maintenance shall not exceed 72 hours as outlined in the maintenance plan required by § 61.272(c)(1)(iii).
              (4) The specifications and requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section for closed vents and control devices do not apply during a control system malfunction. A control system malfunction means any sudden and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment. A failure caused entirely or in part by design deficiencies, poor maintenance, careless operation, or other preventable upset condition or equipment breakdown is not considered a malfunction.
              (d) The owner or operator of each affected storage vessel shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section or § 61.270(g) as follows:
              (1) The owner or operator of each existing benzene storage vessel shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section no later than 90 days after September 14, 1989, with the exceptions noted in paragraphs (a)(5) and (b)(5), unless a waiver of compliance has been approved by the Administrator in accordance with § 61.11.

              (2) The owner or operator of each benzene storage vessel upon which construction commenced after September 14, 1989 shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section or § 61.270(g) prior to filling (i.e., roof is lifted off leg supports) the storage vessel with benzene.
              (3) The owner or operator of each benzene storage vessel upon which construction commenced on or after July 28, 1988, and before September 14, 1989, shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section on September 14, 1989.

              § 61.272
              Compliance provisions.
              (a) For each vessel complying with § 61.271(a) (fixed roof and internal floating roof) each owner or operator shall:
              (1) After installing the control equipment required to comply with § 61.271(a), visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service), prior to filling the storage vessel with benzene. If there are holes, tears or other openings in the primary seal, the secondary seal, or the seal fabric, or defects in the internal floating roof, the owner or operator shall repair the items before filling the storage vessel.

              (2) Visually inspect the internal floating roof and the primary seal or the secondary seal (if one is in service) through manholes and roof hatches on the fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial fill, or at least once every 12 months after September 14, 1989, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. If the internal floating roof is not resting on the surface of the benzene liquid inside the storage vessel, or there is liquid on the roof, or the seal is detached, or there are holes or tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days. If a failure that is detected during inspections required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, an extension of up to 30 additional days may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report required in § 61.275(a). Such a request for an extension must document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable and specify a schedule of actions the company will take that will ensure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
              (3) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes and sleeve seals (if any) each time the storage vessel is emptied and degassed. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of vessels conducting the annual visual inspections as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and at intervals greater than 5 years in the case of vessels specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
              (i) For all the inspections required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to the refilling of each storage vessel to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If the inspection required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the vessel, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, the notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to refilling.
              (ii) If the internal floating roof has defects, the primary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the gaskets no longer close off the liquid surfaces from the atmosphere, or the slotted membrane has more than 10 percent open area, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before refilling the storage vessel with benzene.
              (4) For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in § 61.271(a)(2)(ii):
              (i) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section at least every 5 years; or
              (ii) Visually inspect the vessel annually as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and at least every 10 years as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
              (b) For each vessel complying with § 61.271(b) (external floating roof) the owner or operator shall:
              (1) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the primary seal and the wall of the storage vessel, and the secondary seal and the wall of the storage vessel according to the following frequency.

              (i) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic testing of the vessel or within 90 days of the initial fill with benzene or within 90 days of September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at least once every 5 years thereafter, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              
              (ii) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with a liquid-mounted primary seal and without a secondary seal as provided for in § 61.271(b)(5), measurement of gaps between the vessel wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed within 90 days of September 14, 1989, and at least once per year thereafter. When a secondary seal is installed over the primary seal, measurement of primary seal gaps shall be performed within 90 days of installation and at least once every 5 years thereafter.
              (iii) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the secondary seal shall be performed within 90 days of the initial fill with benzene, within 90 days of installation of the secondary seal, or within 90 days after September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at least once per year thereafter.
              (iv) If any source ceases to store benzene for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of benzene into the vessel shall be considered an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (2) Determine gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary seals individually by the following procedures:
              (i) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
              (ii) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the vessel in each place where a 0.32 centimeter (cm) (1/8 in) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the storage vessel and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
              (iii) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the vessel wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
              (3) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually. Divide the sum for each seal by the nominal diameter of the vessel and compare each ratio to the respective standards in § 61.272(b)(4) and § 61.272(b)(5).
              (4) Repair conditions that do not meet requirements listed in paragraph (b)(4) (i) and (ii) within 45 days of identification in any inspection or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days.
              (i) The accumulated area of gaps between the vessel wall and the metallic shoe seal or the liquid-mounted primary seal shall not exceed 212 cm2 per meter of vessel diameter (10.0 in2 per foot of vessel diameter) and the width of any portion of any gap shall not exceed 3.81 cm (11/2 in).
              (A) One end of the metallic shoe is to extend into the stored liquid and the other end is to extend a minimum vertical distance of 61 cm (24 in) above the stored liquid surface.
              (B) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the shoe, seal fabric, or seal envelope.
              (ii) The secondary seal is to meet the following requirements:
              (A) The secondary seal is to be installed above the primary seal so that it completely covers the space between the roof edge and the vessel wall except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
              (B) The accumulated area of gaps between the vessel wall and the secondary seal shall not exceed 21.2 cm2 per meter of vessel diameter (1.0 in2 per foot of vessel diameter) or the width of any portion of any gap shall not exceed 1.27 cm (1/2 in). These seal gap requirements may be exceeded during the measurement of primary seal gaps as required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (C) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or seal fabric.

              (iii) If a failure that is detected during inspections required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, an extension of up to 30 additional days may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report required in § 61.275(d). Such extension request must include a demonstration of unavailability of alternate storage capacity and a specification of a schedule that will assure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
              (5) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of any gap measurements required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present.
              (6) Visually inspect the external floating roof, the primary seal, secondary seal, and fittings each time the vessel is emptied and degassed.
              (i) If the external floating roof has defects, the primary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before filling or refilling the storage vessel with benzene.
              (ii) For all the inspections required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to filling or refilling of each storage vessel to afford the Administrator the opportunity to inspect the storage vessel prior to refilling. If the inspection required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the vessel, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, this notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling.
              (c) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a closed vent system and control device as required in § 60.271(c), other than a flare, shall meet the following requirements.
              (1) Within 90 days after initial fill or after September 14, 1989, whichever comes last, submit for approval by the Administrator, an operating plan containing the information listed below.
              (i) Documentation demonstrating that the control device being used achieves the required control efficiency during reasonably expected maximum loading conditions. This documentation is to include a description of the gas stream which enters the control device, including flow and benzene content under varying liquid level conditions (dynamic and static) and manufacturer's design specifications for the control device. If the control device or the closed vent capture system receives vapors, gases or liquids, other than fuels, from sources that are not designated sources under this subpart, the efficiency demonstration is to include consideration of all vapors, gases and liquids received by the closed vent capture system and control device. If an enclosed combustion device with a minimum residence time of 0.75 seconds and a minimum temperature of 816 °C (1,500 °F) is used to meet the 95 percent requirement, documentation that those conditions exist is sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph.
              (ii) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to ensure that the control device is operated and maintained in conformance with its design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that parameter (or parameters).
              (iii) A maintenance plan for the system including the type of maintenance necessary, planned frequency of maintenance, and lengths of maintenance periods for those operations that would require the closed vent system or the control device to be out of compliance with § 61.271(c). The maintenance plan shall require that the system be out of compliance with § 61.271(c) for no more than 72 hours per year.

              (2) Operate, monitor the parameters, and maintain the closed vent system and control device in accordance with the operating plan submitted to the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the plan was modified by the Administrator during the approval process. In this case, the modified plan applies.
              
              (d) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a closed vent system and a flare to meet the requirements in § 61.271(c) shall meet the requirements as specified in the general control device requirements in 40 CFR 60.18 (e) and (f).

              § 61.273
              Alternative means of emission limitation.
              (a) Upon written application from any person, the Administrator may approve the use of alternative means of emission limitation which have been demonstrated to his satisfaction to achieve a reduction in benzene emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions achieved by any requirement in § 61.271 (a), (b), or (c) of this subpart.
              (b) Determination of equivalence to the reduction in emissions achieved by the requirements of § 61.271 (a), (b), or (c) will be evaluated using the following information to be included in the written application to the Administrator:
              (1) Actual emissions tests that use full-size or scale-model storage vessels that accurately collect and measure all benzene emissions from a given control device, and that accurately simulate wind and account for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric pressure.
              (2) An engineering evaluation that the Administrator determines is an accurate method of determining equivalence.
              (c) The Administrator may condition approval of equivalency on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the same emission reduction as the requirements of § 61.271 (a), (b), or (c).

              (d) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an application for equivalence may be approvable, the Administrator will publish a notice of preliminary determination in the Federal Register and provide the opportunity for public hearing. After notice and opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator will determine the equivalence of the alternative means of emission limitation and will publish the final determination in the Federal Register.

              § 61.301
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act, or in subpart A or subpart V of part 61.
              
                Bulk terminal means any facility which receives liquid product containing benzene by pipelines, marine vessels, tank trucks, or railcars, and loads the product for further distribution into tank trucks, railcars, or marine vessels.
              
                Car-sealed means having a seal that is placed on the device used to change the position of a valve (e.g., from open to closed) such that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal and requiring the replacement of the old seal, once broken, with a new seal.
              
                Control device means all equipment used for recovering or oxidizing benzene vapors displaced from the affected facility.
              
                Incinerator means any enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds and that does not extract energy in the form of steam or process heat. These devices do not rely on the heating value of the waste gas to sustain efficient combustion. Auxiliary fuel is burned in the device and the heat from the fuel flame heats the waste gas to combustion temperature. Temperature is controlled by controlling combustion air or fuel.
              
                Leak means any instrument reading of 10,000 ppmv or greater using Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
              
                Loading cycle means the time period from the beginning of filling a tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel until flow to the control device ceases, as measured by the flow indicator.
              
                Loading rack means the loading arms, pumps, meters, shutoff valves, relief valves, and other piping and valves necessary to fill tank trucks, railcars, or marine vessels.
              
                Marine vessel means any tank ship or tank barge which transports liquid product such as benzene.
              
                Nonvapor tight means any tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel that does not pass the required vapor-tightness test.
              
                Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by burning fuel to fluids contained in tubes, except water that is heated to produce steam.
              
                Steam generating unit means any enclosed combustion device that uses fuel energy in the form of steam.
              
                Vapor collection system means any equipment located at the affected facility used for containing benzene vapors displaced during the loading of tank trucks, railcars, or marine vessels. This does not include the vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel vapor collection manifold system.
              
                Vapor-tight marine vessel means a marine vessel with a benzene product tank that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to have no leaks. This demonstration shall be made using Method 21 of part 60, appendix A, during the last 20 percent of loading and during a period when the vessel is being loaded at its maximum loading rate. A reading of greater than 10,000 ppm as methane shall constitute a leak. As an alternative, a marine vessel owner or operator may use the vapor-tightness test described in § 61.304(f) to demonstrate vapor tightness. A marine vessel operated at negative pressure is assumed to be vapor-tight for the purpose of this standard.
              
                Vapor-tight tank truck or vapor-tight railcar means a tank truck or railcar for which it has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months that its product tank will sustain a pressure change of not more than 750 pascals within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 pascals. This capability is to be demonstrated using the pressure test procedure specified in Method 27 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, and a pressure measurement device which has a precision of ±2.5 mm water and which is capable of measuring above the pressure at which the tank truck or railcar is to be tested for vapor tightness.

              § 61.302
              Standards.
              (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall equip each loading rack with a vapor collection system that is:
              (1) Designed to collect all benzene vapors displaced from tank trucks, railcars, or marine vessels during loading, and
              (2) Designed to prevent any benzene vapors collected at one loading rack from passing through another loading rack to the atmosphere.

              (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install a control device and reduce benzene emissions routed to the atmosphere through the control device by 98 weight percent. If a boiler or process heater is used to comply with the percent reduction requirement, then the vent stream shall be introduced into the flame zone of such a device.
              
              (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall operate any flare used to comply with paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with the requirements of § 60.18 (b) through (f).
              (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall limit loading of benzene into vapor-tight tank trucks and vapor-tight railcars using the following procedures:
              (1) The owner or operator shall obtain the vapor-tightness documentation described in § 61.305(h) for each tank truck or railcar loaded at the affected facility. The test date in the documentation must be within the preceding 12 months. The vapor-tightness test to be used for tank trucks and railcars is Method 27 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
              (2) The owner or operator shall cross-check the identification number for each tank truck or railcar to be loaded with the file of vapor-tightness documentation before the corresponding tank truck or railcar is loaded. If no documentation is on file, the owner or operator shall obtain a copy of the information from the tank truck or railcar operator before the tank truck or railcar is loaded.
              (3) Alternate procedures to those described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section may be used upon application to, and approval by, the Administrator.
              (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall limit the loading of marine vessels to those vessels that are vapor tight as determined by either paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), or (e)(4) of this section.
              (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall ensure that each marine vessel is loaded with the benzene product tank below atmospheric pressure (i.e., at negative pressure). If the pressure is measured at the interface between the shoreside vapor collection pipe and the marine vessel vapor line, the pressure measured according to the procedures in § 61.303(f) must be below atmospheric pressure.
              (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use the following procedure to obtain the vapor-tightness documentation described in § 61.305(h). The vapor-tightness test for marine vessels is Method 21 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, and shall be applied to any potential sources of vapor leaks. A reading of 10,000 ppmv or greater as methane shall constitute a leak.
              (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain the leak test documentation described in § 61.305(h) for each marine vessel prior to loading, if available. The date of the test listed in the documentation must be within the 12 preceding months.
              (ii) If there is no documentation of a successful leak test conducted on the marine vessel in the preceding 12 months, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall require that a leak test of the marine vessel be conducted during the final 20 percent of loading of the marine vessel or shall not load the vessel. The test shall be conducted when the marine vessel is being loaded at the maximum allowable loading rate.
              (A) If no leak is detected, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall require that the documentation described in § 61.305(h) is completed prior to departure of the vessel. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall retain a copy of the vapor-tightness documentation on file.
              (B) If any leak is detected, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall require that the vapor-tightness failure be documented for the marine vessel owner or operator prior to departure of the vessel. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall retain a copy of the vapor-tightness documentation on file. Delay of repair of equipment for which leaks have been detected will be allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without dry-docking the vessel. This equipment will be excluded from future Method 21 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 tests until repairs are effected. Repair of this equipment shall occur the next time the vessel is dry-docked.

              (iii) If the marine vessel has failed its most recent vapor-tightness test as described in § 61.302(e)(2)(ii), the owner or operator of the affected facility shall require that the owner or operator of the nonvapor-tight marine vessel provide documentation that the leaks detected during the previous vapor-tightness test have been repaired, or proof that repair is technically infeasible without dry-docking the vessel. Once the repair documentation has been provided, the owner or operator may load the marine vessel. The owner or operator shall require that the vapor-tightness test described in § 61.302(e)(2)(ii) be conducted during loading, and shall retain a copy of the vapor-tightness documentation on file.
              (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain a copy of the marine vessel's vapor-tightness documentation described in § 61.305(h) for a test conducted within the preceding 12 months in accordance with § 61.304(f).
              (4) Alternate procedures to those described in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section may be used upon application to, and approval by, the Administrator.
              (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall limit loading of benzene to tank trucks, railcars, and marine vessels equipped with vapor collection equipment that is compatible with the affected facility's vapor collection system.
              (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall limit loading of tank trucks, railcars, and marine vessels to tank trucks, railcars, and marine vessels whose collection systems are connected to the affected facility's vapor collection systems.
              (h) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall ensure that the vapor collection and benzene loading equipment of tank trucks and railcars shall be designed and operated to prevent gauge pressure in the tank truck or railcar tank from exceeding, during loading, the initial pressure the tank was pressured up to and shown to be vapor tight at during the most recent vapor-tightness test using Method 27 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. This vapor-tightness test pressure is not to be exceeded when measured by the procedures specified in § 61.304(c).
              (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall ensure that no pressure-vacuum vent in the affected facility's vapor collection system for tank trucks and railcars shall begin to open at a system pressure less than the maximum pressure at which the tank truck or railcar is operated.
              (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall ensure that the maximum normal operating pressure of the marine vessel's vapor collection equipment shall not exceed 0.8 times the relief set pressure of the pressure-vacuum vents. This level is not to be exceeded when measured by the procedures specified in § 61.304(d).
              (k) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall inspect the vapor collection system and the control device for detectable emissions, and shall repair any leaks detected, in accordance with § 61.242-11 (e) and (f). This inspection of the vapor collection system and control device shall be done during the loading of tank trucks, railcars, or marine vessels.
              (l) Vent systems that contain valves that could divert a vent stream from a control device shall have car-sealed opened all valves in the vent system from the emission source to the control device, and car-sealed closed all valves in the vent system that would lead the vent stream to the atmosphere, either directly or indirectly, bypassing the control device.

              § 61.304
              Test methods and procedures.
              (a) The procedures for determining compliance with § 61.302(b) for all control devices other than flares is as follows:
              (1) All testing equipment shall be prepared and installed as specified in the appropriate test methods.
              (2) The time period for a performance test shall be not less than 6 hours, during which at least 300,000 liters of benzene are loaded. If the throughput criterion is not met during the initial 6 hours, the test may be either continued until the throughput criterion is met, or resumed the next day with at least another 6 complete hours of testing.
              (3) For intermittent control devices:
              (i) The vapor holder level of the intermittent control device shall be recorded at the start of the performance test. The end of the performance test shall coincide with the time when the vapor holder is at its original level.
              (ii) At least two startups and shutdowns of the control device shall occur during the performance test. If this does not occur under an automatically controlled operation, the system shall be manually controlled.
              (4) An emission testing interval shall consist of each 5-minute period during the performance test. For each interval:
              (i) The reading from each measurement instrument shall be recorded.

              (iv) The average benzene concentration upstream and downstream of the control device in the vent shall be determined using Method 25A or Method 25B of appendix A of this part, using benzene as the calibration gas. The average benzene concentration shall correspond to the volume measurement by taking into account the sampling system response time.

              (5) The mass emitted during each testing interval shall be calculated as follows:
              
              Mi = FKVS C
              
              
                where:

                EC15NO91.056
              
              
                where:
                
                E = Mass flow rate of benzene emitted, kg/hr.
                Mi = Mass of benzene emitted during testing interval i, kg.
                T = Total time of all testing intervals, hr.
                n = Number of testing intervals.
              
              
              (7) The percent reduction across the control device shall be calculated as follows:
              
                EC15NO91.057

                Ea = Mass flow rate of benzene after control device, kg/hr.
              
              
              (b) When a flare is used to comply with § 61.302(b), a performance test according to Method 22 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be performed to determine visible emissions. The observation period shall be at least 2 hours. Performance testing shall be conducted during at least three complete loading cycles with a separate test run for each loading cycle. The observation period for detecting visible emissions shall encompass each loading cycle.

              (1) Calibrate and install a pressure measurement device (liquid manometer, magnehelic gauge, or equivalent instrument), which has a precision of ±2.5 mm H20 in the range that the tank truck or railcar was initially pressured to during the most recent vapor-tightness test.
              (2) Connect the pressure measurement device to a pressure tap in the affected facility's vapor collection system, located as close as possible to the connection with the tank truck or railcar.
              (3) During the performance test, record the pressure every 5 minutes while a tank truck or railcar is being loaded, and record the highest instantaneous pressure that occurs during each loading cycle. Every loading rack shall be tested at least once during the performance test.
              (4) If more than one loading rack is used simultaneously, then the performance test shall be conducted simultaneously to represent the maximum capacity.
              (d) For the purpose of determining compliance with § 61.302(j), the following procedures shall be used:
              (1) Calibrate and install a pressure measurement device (liquid manometer, magnehelic gauge, or equivalent instrument), capable of measuring up to the relief set pressure of the pressure-vacuum vents.
              (2) Connect the pressure measurement device to a pressure tap in the affected facility's vapor collection system, located as close as possible to the connection with the marine vessel.
              (3) During the performance test, record the pressure every 5 minutes while a marine vessel is being loaded, and record the highest instantaneous pressure that occurs during each loading cycle.
              (e) Immediately prior to a performance test required for determination of compliance with § 61.302(b), all potential sources of vapor leakage in the affected facility's vapor collection system equipment shall be inspected for detectable emissions as required in § 61.302(k). The monitoring shall be conducted only while a vapor-tight tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel is being loaded. All identified leaks in the terminal's vapor collection system shall be repaired prior to conducting the performance test.
              (f) The following test method shall be used to comply with the marine vessel vapor-tightness requirements of § 61.302(e)(3):
              (1) Each benzene product tank shall be pressurized with dry air or inert gas to not less than 1.0 psig and not more than the pressure of the lowest relief valve setting.
              (2) Once the pressure is obtained, the dry air or inert gas source shall be shut off.

              (3) At the end of one-half hour, the pressure in the benzene product tank and piping shall be measured. The change in pressure shall be calculated using the following formula:
              
              Δ P = Pi—Pf
              
              
              
                where:
                
                Δ P = Change in pressure, inches of water.
                Pi = Pressure in tank when air/gas source is shut off, inches of water.
                Pf = Pressure in tank at the end of one-half hour after air/gas source is shut off, inches of water.
              
              

              (4) The change in pressure, Δ P, shall be compared to the pressure drop calculated using the following formula:
              
              Δ PM = 0.861 Pia L/V
              
              
                where:
                
                Δ PM = Maximum allowable pressure change, inches of water.
                Pia = Pressure in tank when air/gas source is shut off, pounds per square inch, absolute (psia).
                L = Maximum permitted loading rate of vessel, barrels per hour.
                V = Total volume of product tank, barrels.
              
              
              (5) If ΔP≤ΔPM, the vessel is vapor tight.
              (6) If ΔP>ΔPM, the vessel is not vapor tight and the source of the leak must be identified and repaired prior to retesting.

              § 61.342
              Standards: General.
              (a) An owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is less than 10 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (11 ton/yr) shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is the sum of the annual benzene quantity for each waste stream at the facility that has a flow-weighted annual average water content greater than 10 percent or that is mixed with water, or other wastes, at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent. The benzene quantity in a waste stream is to be counted only once without multiple counting if other waste streams are mixed with or generated from the original waste stream. Other specific requirements for calculating the total annual benzene waste quantity are as follows:
              (1) Wastes that are exempted from control under §§ 61.342(c)(2) and 61.342(c)(3) are included in the calculation of the total annual benzene quantity if they have an annual average water content greater than 10 percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.
              (2) The benzene in a material subject to this subpart that is sold is included in the calculation of the total annual benzene quantity if the material has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.

              (3) Benzene in wastes generated by remediation activities conducted at the facility, such as the excavation of contaminated soil, pumping and treatment of groundwater, and the recovery of product from soil or groundwater, are not included in the calculation of total annual benzene quantity for that facility. If the facility's total annual benzene quantity is 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) or more, wastes generated by remediation activities are subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section. If the facility is managing remediation waste generated offsite, the benzene in this waste shall be included in the calculation of total annual benzene quantity in facility waste, if the waste streams have an annual average water content greater than 10 percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.
              
              (4) The total annual benzene quantity is determined based upon the quantity of benzene in the waste before any waste treatment occurs to remove the benzene except as specified in § 61.355(c)(1)(i) (A) through (C).
              (b) Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall be in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section no later than 90 days following the effective date, unless a waiver of compliance has been obtained under § 61.11, or by the initial startup for a new source with an initial startup after the effective date.
              (1) The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with the rule within the required time may request a waiver of compliance under § 61.10.
              (2) As part of the waiver application, the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a plan under § 61.10(b)(3) that is an enforceable commitment to obtain environmental benefits to mitigate the benzene emissions that result from extending the compliance date. The plan shall include the following information:
              (i) A description of the method of compliance, including the control approach, schedule for installing controls, and quantity of the benzene emissions that result from extending the compliance date;
              (ii) If the control approach involves a compliance strategy designed to obtain integrated compliance with multiple regulatory requirements, a description of the other regulations involved and their effective dates; and
              (iii) A description of the actions to be taken at the facility to obtain mitigating environmental benefits, including how the benefits will be obtained, the schedule for these actions, and an estimate of the quantifiable benefits that directly result from these actions.
              (c) Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall manage and treat the facility waste as follows:
              (1) For each waste stream that contains benzene, including (but not limited to) organic waste streams that contain less than 10 percent water and aqueous waste streams, even if the wastes are not discharged to an individual drain system, the owner or operator shall:
              (i) Remove or destroy the benzene contained in the waste using a treatment process or wastewater treatment system that complies with the standards specified in § 61.348 of this subpart.
              (ii) Comply with the standards specified in §§ 61.343 through 61.347 of this subpart for each waste management unit that receives or manages the waste stream prior to and during treatment of the waste stream in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
              (iii) Each waste management unit used to manage or treat waste streams that will be recycled to a process shall comply with the standards specified in §§ 61.343 through 61.347. Once the waste stream is recycled to a process, including to a tank used for the storage of production process feed, product, or product intermediates, unless this tank is used primarily for the storage of wastes, the material is no longer subject to paragraph (c) of this section.
              (2) A waste stream is exempt from paragraph (c)(1) of this section provided that the owner or operator demonstrates initially and, thereafter, at least once per year that the flow-weighted annual average benzene concentration for the waste stream is less than 10 ppmw as determined by the procedures specified in § 61.355(c)(2) or § 61.355(c)(3).
              (3) A waste stream is exempt from paragraph (c)(1) of this section provided that the owner or operator demonstrates initially and, thereafter, at least once per year that the conditions specified in either paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (c)(3)(ii) of this section are met.
              (i) The waste stream is process wastewater that has a flow rate less than 0.02 liters per minute (0.005 gallons per minute) or an annual wastewater quantity of less than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr); or
              (ii) All of the following conditions are met:
              
              (A) The owner or operator does not choose to exempt process wastewater under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section,

              (C) The total annual benzene quantity in a waste stream chosen for exemption, including process unit turnaround waste, is determined for the year in which the waste is generated.
              (d) As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, an owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section may elect to manage and treat the facility waste as follows:
              (1) The owner or operator shall manage and treat facility waste other than process wastewater in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

              1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of Hg emissions, including both particulate and gaseous Hg, from chlor-alkali plants and other sources (as specified in the regulations) where the carrier-gas stream in the duct or stack is principally air.
              1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.
              2.0 Summary of Method
              Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and collected in acidic iodine monochloride (ICl) solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an optical cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
              3.0 Definitions [Reserved]
              
              4.0 Interferences
              4.1 Sample Collection. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) reduces ICl and causes premature depletion of the ICl solution.
              4.2 Sample Analysis.
              4.2.1 ICl concentrations greater than 10−4 molar inhibit the reduction of the Hg (II) ion in the aeration cell.
              4.2.2 Condensation of water vapor on the optical cell windows causes a positive interference.
              5.0 Safety

              7.0 Reagents and Standards
              Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents must conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society; where such specifications are not available, use the best available grade.
              7.1 Sample Collection. The following reagents are required for sample collection:

              7.1.1 Water. Deionized distilled, to conform to ASTM D 1193-77 or 91 (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18), Type 1. If high concentrations of organic matter are not expected to be present, the analyst may eliminate the KMnO4 test for oxidizable organic matter. Use this water in all dilutions and solution preparations.

              7.1.2 Nitric Acid, 50 Percent (v/v). Mix equal volumes of concentrated HNO3 and water, being careful to add the acid to the water slowly.
              7.1.3 Silica Gel. Indicating type, 6- to 16-mesh. If previously used, dry at 175 °C (350 °F) for 2 hours. The tester may use new silica gel as received.
              7.1.4 Potassium Iodide (KI) Solution, 25 Percent. Dissolve 250 g of KI in water, and dilute to 1 liter.

              7.1.5 Iodine Monochloride Stock Solution, 1.0 M. To 800 ml of 25 percent KI solution, add 800 ml of concentrated HCl. Cool to room temperature. With vigorous stirring, slowly add 135 g of potassium iodate (KIO3), and stir until all free iodine has dissolved. A clear orange-red solution occurs when all the KIO3 has been added. Cool to room temperature, and dilute to 1800 ml with water. Keep the solution in amber glass bottles to prevent degradation.
              7.1.6 Absorbing Solution, 0.1 M ICl. Dilute 100 ml of the 1.0 M ICl stock solution to 1 liter with water. Keep the solution in amber glass bottles and in darkness to prevent degradation. This reagent is stable for at least two months.
              7.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis. The following reagents and standards are required for sample preparation and analysis:
              7.2.1 Reagents.

              7.2.1.1 Tin (II) Solution. Prepare fresh daily, and keep sealed when not being used. Completely dissolve 20 g of tin (II) chloride (or 25 g of tin (II) sulfate) crystals (Baker Analyzed reagent grade or any other brand that will give a clear solution) in 25 ml of concentrated HCl. Dilute to 250 ml with water. Do not substitute HNO3, H2SO4, or other strong acids for the HCl.

              7.2.1.2 Sulfuric Acid, 5 Percent (v/v). Dilute 25 ml of concentrated H2SO4 to 500 ml with water.
              7.2.2 Standards

              7.2.2.1 Hg Stock Solution, 1 mg Hg/ml. Prepare and store all Hg standard solutions in borosilicate glass containers. Completely dissolve 0.1354 g of Hg (II) chloride in 75 ml of water in a 100-ml glass volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO3, and adjust the volume to exactly 100 ml with water. Mix thoroughly. This solution is stable for at least one month.

              7.2.2.2 Intermediate Hg Standard Solution, 10 µg Hg/ml. Prepare fresh weekly. Pipet 5.0 ml of the Hg stock solution (Section 7.2.2.1) into a 500-ml glass volumetric flask, and add 20 ml of the 5 percent H2SO4 solution. Dilute to exactly 500 ml with water. Thoroughly mix the solution.

              7.2.2.3 Working Hg Standard Solution, 200 ng Hg/ml. Prepare fresh daily. Pipet 5.0 ml of the intermediate Hg standard solution (Section 7.2.2.2) into a 250-ml volumetric glass flask. Add 10 ml of the 5 percent H2SO4 and 2 ml of the 0.1 M ICl absorbing solution taken as a blank (Section 8.7.4.3), and dilute to 250 ml with water. Mix thoroughly.
              8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
              Because of the complexity of this method, testers should be trained and experienced with the test procedures to ensure reliable results. Since the amount of Hg that is collected generally is small, the method must be carefully applied to prevent contamination or loss of sample.
              8.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the general procedure outlined in Method 5, Section 8.1, except omit Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3.
              8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Follow the general procedure outlined in Method 5, Section 8.2, with the exception of the following:
              8.2.1 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads to assure that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm).

              8.2.2 Perform test runs such that samples are obtained over a period or periods that accurately determine the maximum emissions that occur in a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, run sufficient tests for the accurate determination of the emissions that occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sample time of 2 hours is recommended. In some instances, high Hg or high SO2 concentrations make it impossible to sample for the desired minimum time. This is indicated by reddening (liberation of free iodine) in the first impinger. In these cases, the sample run may be divided into two or more subruns to ensure that the absorbing solution is not depleted.
              8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.

              8.3.1 Clean all glassware (probe, impingers, and connectors) by rinsing with 50 percent HNO3, tap water, 0.1 M ICl, tap water, and finally deionized distilled water. Place 100 ml of 0.1 M ICl in each of the first three impingers. Take care to prevent the absorbing solution from contacting any greased surfaces. Place approximately 200 g of preweighed silica gel in the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be used, but care should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and carried out from the impinger during sampling. Place the silica gel container in a clean place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, determine and record the weight of the silica gel plus impinger to the nearest 0.5 g.
              8.3.2 Install the selected nozzle using a Viton A O-ring when stack temperatures are less than 260 °C (500 °F). Use a fiberglass string gasket if temperatures are higher. See APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in Method 5) for details. Other connecting systems using either 316 stainless steel or Teflon ferrules may be used. Mark the probe with heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.

              8.3.3 Assemble the train as shown in Figure 101-1, using (if necessary) a very light coat of silicone grease on all ground glass joints. Grease only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) to avoid the possibility of contamination by the silicone grease.
              
              
                Note:
                An empty impinger may be inserted between the third impinger and the silica gel to remove excess moisture from the sample stream.
              
              
              8.3.4 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the probe heating system, if applicable, at the desired operating temperature. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed ice around the impingers.
              8.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Follow the leak-check procedures outlined in Method 5, Section 8.4.
              8.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the general procedure outlined in Method 5, Section 8.5. For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 101-4.
              8.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, Section 8.6.
              8.7 Sample Recovery. Begin proper cleanup procedure as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period.
              8.7.1 Allow the probe to cool. When it can be safely handled, wipe off any external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle, and place a cap over it. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling. Capping would create a vacuum and draw liquid out from the impingers.
              8.7.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the train, wipe off the silicone grease, and cap the open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Wipe off the silicone grease from the impinger. Use either ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps to close these openings.
              8.7.3 Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to a cleanup area that is clean, protected from the wind, and free of Hg contamination. The ambient air in laboratories located in the immediate vicinity of Hg-using facilities is not normally free of Hg contamination.
              8.7.4 Inspect the train before and during disassembly, and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows.
              8.7.4.1 Container No. 1 (Impingers and Probe).

              8.7.4.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure the liquid in the first three impingers to within 1 ml. Record the volume of liquid present (e.g., see Figure 5-6 of Method 5). This information is needed to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. (Use only glass storage bottles and graduated cylinders that have been precleaned as in Section 8.3.1) Place the contents of the first three impingers into a 1000-ml glass sample bottle.
              8.7.4.1.2 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover the Hg (and any condensate) from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, and probe liner as follows: Rinse these components with two 50-ml portions of 0.1 M ICl. Next, rinse the probe nozzle, fitting and liner, and each piece of connecting glassware between the probe liner and the back half of the third impinger with a maximum of 400 ml of water. Add all washings to the 1000-ml glass sample bottle containing the liquid from the first three impingers.
              8.7.4.1.3 After all washings have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid on the container to prevent leakage during shipment to the laboratory. Mark the height of the liquid to determine later whether leakage occurred during transport. Label the container to identify clearly its contents.

              8.7.4.2 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.
              
              8.7.4.3 Container No. 3 (Absorbing Solution Blank). Place 50 ml of the 0.1 M ICl absorbing solution in a 100-ml sample bottle. Seal the container. Use this blank to prepare the working Hg standard solution (Section 7.2.2.3).

              9.2 Volume Metering System Checks. Same as Method 5, Section 9.2.
              10.0 Calibration and Standardizations
              
                Note:
                Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
              

              10.1 Before use, clean all glassware, both new and used, as follows: brush with soap and tap water, liberally rinse with tap water, soak for 1 hour in 50 percent HNO3, and then rinse with deionized distilled water.
              10.2 Sampling Equipment. Calibrate the sampling equipment according to the procedures outlined in the following sections of Method 5: Section 10.1 (Probe Nozzle), Section 10.2 (Pitot Tube Assembly), Section 10.3 (Metering System), Section 10.5 (Temperature Sensors), Section 10.6 (Barometer).
              10.3 Aeration System Flow Rate Meter. Assemble the aeration system as shown in Figure 101-5. Set the outlet pressure on the aeration gas cylinder regulator to a minimum pressure of 500 mm Hg (10 psi), and use the flow metering valve and a bubble flowmeter or wet-test meter to obtain a flow rate of 1.5 ±0.1 liters/min (0.053 ±0.0035 cfm) through the aeration cell. After the calibration of the aeration system flow rate meter is complete, remove the bubble flowmeter from the system.
              10.4 Optical Cell Heating System. Using a 50-ml graduated cylinder, add 50 ml of water to the bottle section of the aeration cell, and attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the cell. Attach the aeration cell to the optical cell and while aerating at 1.5 ±0.1 liters/min (0.053 ±0.0035 cfm), determine the minimum variable transformer setting necessary to prevent condensation of moisture in the optical cell and in the connecting tubing. (This setting should not exceed 20 volts.)
              10.5 Spectrophotometer and Recorder.

              10.5.1 The Hg response may be measured by either peak height or peak area.
              
              
                Note:
                The temperature of the solution affects the rate at which elemental Hg is released from a solution and, consequently, it affects the shape of the absorption curve (area) and the point of maximum absorbance (peak height). Therefore, to obtain reproducible results, bring all solutions to room temperature before use.
              
              

              10.5.2 Set the spectrophotometer wavelength at 253.7 nm, and make certain the optical cell is at the minimum temperature that will prevent water condensation. Then set the recorder scale as follows: Using a 50-ml graduated cylinder, add 50 ml of water to the aeration cell bottle. Add three drops of Antifoam B to the bottle, and then pipet 5.0 ml of the working Hg standard solution into the aeration cell.
              
              
                Note:
                Always add the Hg-containing solution to the aeration cell after the 50 ml of water.
              
              
              10.5.3 Place a Teflon-coated stirring bar in the bottle. Before attaching the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell, make certain that (1) the aeration cell exit arm stopcock (Figure 101-3) is closed (so that Hg will not prematurely enter the optical cell when the reducing agent is being added) and (2) there is no flow through the bubbler. If conditions (1) and (2) are met, attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell. Pipet 5 ml of tin (II) reducing solution into the aeration cell through the side arm, and immediately stopper the side arm. Stir the solution for 15 seconds, turn on the recorder, open the aeration cell exit arm stopcock, and immediately initiate aeration with continued stirring. Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.
              10.6 Calibration Curve.

              10.6.1 After setting the recorder scale, repeat the procedure in Section 10.5 using 0.0-, 1.0-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 4.0-, and 5.0-ml aliquots of the working standard solution (final amount of Hg in the aeration cell is 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ng, respectively). Repeat this procedure on each aliquot size until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value.
              
              
                Note:
                To prevent Hg carryover from one sample to another, do not close the aeration cell from the optical cell until the recorder pen has returned to the baseline.)
              
              

              10.6.2 It should not be necessary to disconnect the aeration gas inlet line from the aeration cell when changing samples. After separating the bottle and bubbler sections of the aeration cell, place the bubbler section into a 600-ml beaker containing approximately 400 ml of water. Rinse the bottle section of the aeration cell with a stream of water to remove all traces of the tin (II) reducing agent. Also, to prevent the loss of Hg before aeration, remove all traces of the reducing agent between samples by washing with water. It will be necessary, however, to wash the aeration cell parts with concentrated HCl if any of the following conditions occur: (1) A white film appears on any inside surface of the aeration cell, (2) the calibration curve changes suddenly, or (3) the replicate samples do not yield reproducible results.
              10.6.3 Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank (0.0-ml aliquot)—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak heights of the 1.0-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 4.0-, and 5.0-ml aliquot standards. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Hg contamination of a reagent or carry-over of Hg from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding final total Hg weight in the aeration cell (in ng), and draw the best fit straight line. This line should either pass through the origin or pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. If the line does not pass through or very near to the origin, check for nonlinearity of the curve and for incorrectly prepared standards.
              11.0 Analytical Procedure
              11.1 Sample Loss Check. Check the liquid level in each container to see whether liquid was lost during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or use methods subject to the approval of the Administrator to account for the losses.
              11.2 Sample Preparation. Treat each sample as follows:
              11.2.1 Container No. 1 (Impingers and Probe). Carefully transfer the contents of Container No. 1 into a 1000-ml volumetric flask, and adjust the volume to exactly 1000 ml with water.

              11.2.2 Dilutions. Pipet a 2-ml aliquot from the diluted sample from Section 11.2.1 into a 250-ml volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of 5 percent H2SO4, and adjust the volume to exactly 250 ml with water. This solution is stable for at least 72 hours.
              
              
                Note:
                The dilution factor will be 250/2 for this solution.
              
              
              11.3 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.3 through 10.6.
              11.3.1 Mercury Samples. Repeat the procedure used to establish the calibration curve with an appropriately sized aliquot (1 to 5 ml) of the diluted sample (from Section 11.2.2) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. The peak maximum of an aliquot (except the 5-ml aliquot) must be greater than 10 percent of the recorder full scale. If the peak maximum of a 1.0-ml aliquot is off scale on the recorder, further dilute the original source sample to bring the Hg concentration into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer.
              11.3.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
              11.3.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Use the Method of Standard Additions as follows to check at least one sample from each source for matrix effects on the Hg results. The Method of Standard Additions procedures described on pages 9-4 and 9-5 of the section entitled “General Information” of the Perkin Elmer Corporation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry Manual, Number 303-0152 (Reference 16 in Section 16.0) are recommended. If the results of the Method of Standard Additions procedure used on the single source sample do not agree to within ±5 percent of the value obtained by the routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from the source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.
              11.4 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. (This step may be conducted in the field.)
              12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
              Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal significant figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures only after the final calculation. Other forms of the equations may be used as long as they give equivalent results.
              12.1 Average Dry Gas Meter Temperature and Average Orifice Pressure Drop, Dry Gas Volume, Volume of Water Vapor Condensed, Moisture Content, and Isokinetic Variation. Same as Method 5, Sections 12.2 through 12.5 and 12.11, respectively.

              12.2 Stack Gas Velocity. Using the data from this test and Equation 2-9 of Method 2, calculate the average stack gas velocity vs.
              12.3 Total Mercury.

              12.3.1 For each source sample, correct the average maximum absorbance of the two consecutive samples whose peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average for the contribution of the solution blank (see Section 10.6.3). Use the calibration curve and these corrected averages to determine the final total weight of Hg in ng in the aeration cell for each source sample.

              12.3.2 Correct for any dilutions made to bring the sample into the working range of the spectrophotometer. Then calculate the Hg in the original solution, mHg, as follows:
              
                ER17oc00.491
              
              Where:
              
              CHg(AC) = Total ng of Hg in aliquot analyzed (reagent blank subtracted).

              DF = Dilution factor for the Hg-containing solution (before adding to the aeration cell; e.g., DF = 250/2 if the source samples were diluted as described in Section 11.2.2).
              Vf = Solution volume of original sample, 1000 ml for samples diluted as described in Section 11.2.1.
              10−3 = Conversion factor, µg/ng.
              S = Aliquot volume added to aeration cell, ml.
              
              12.4 Mercury Emission Rate. Calculate the daily Hg emission rate, R, using Equation 101-2. For continuous operations, the operating time is equal to 86,400 seconds per day. For cyclic operations, use only the time per day each stack is in operation. The total Hg emission rate from a source will be the summation of results from all stacks.
              
                ER17oc00.492
              
              Where:
              
              K1 = 0.3858 °K/mm Hg for metric units.
              K1 = 17.64 °R/in. Hg for English units.
              K3 = 10−6 g/µg for metric units.
               = 2.2046 “ × 10−9 lb/µg for English units.
              Ps = Absolute stack gas pressure, mm Hg (in. Hg).
              t = Daily operating time, sec/day.
              Ts = Absolute average stack gas temperature, °K (°R).
              Vm(std) = Dry gas sample volume at standard conditions, scm (scf).
              Vw(std) = Volume of water vapor at standard conditions, scm (scf).
              
              12.5 Determination of Compliance. Each performance test consists of three repetitions of the applicable test method. For the purpose of determining compliance with an applicable national emission standard, use the average of the results of all repetitions.
              13.0 Method Performance
              The following estimates are based on collaborative tests, wherein 13 laboratories performed duplicate analyses on two Hg-containing samples from a chlor-alkali plant and on one laboratory-prepared sample of known Hg concentration. The sample concentrations ranged from 2 to 65 µg Hg/ml.
              13.1 Precision. The estimated intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory standard deviations are 1.6 and 1.8 µg Hg/ml, respectively.
              13.2 Accuracy. The participating laboratories that analyzed a 64.3 µg Hg/ml (in 0.1 M ICl) standard obtained a mean of 63.7 µg Hg/ml.
              13.3 Analytical Range. After initial dilution, the range of this method is 0.5 to 120 µg Hg/ml. The upper limit can be extended by further dilution of the sample.
              14.0 Pollution Prevention. [Reserved]
              
              15.0 Waste Management. [Reserved]

              1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.
              2.0 Summary of Method

              2.1 Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and are collected in acidic potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an optical cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
              3.0 Definitions. [Reserved]
              
              4.0 Interferences

              4.1 Sample Collection. Excessive oxidizable organic matter in the stack gas prematurely depletes the KMnO4 solution and thereby prevents further collection of Hg.
              4.2 Analysis. Condensation of water vapor on the optical cell windows causes a positive interference.
              5.0 Safety
              5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
              5.2 Corrosive Reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal burns.
              5.2.1 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Highly toxic. Vapors are highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, producing hydrogen gas.
              5.2.2 Nitric Acid (HNO3). Highly corrosive to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs. Vapors cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Reaction to inhalation may be delayed as long as 30 hours and still be fatal. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Strong oxidizer. Hazardous reaction may occur with organic materials such as solvents.
              5.2.3 Sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Rapidly destructive to body tissue. Will cause third degree burns. Eye damage may result in blindness. Inhalation may be fatal from spasm of the larynx, usually within 30 minutes. May cause lung tissue damage with edema. 3 mg/m3 will cause lung damage in uninitiated. 1 mg/m3 for 8 hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals and organics.

              5.3 Chlorine Evolution. Hydrochloric acid reacts with KMnO4 to liberate chlorine gas. Although this is a minimal concern when small quantities of HCl (5-10 ml) are used in the impinger rinse, a potential safety hazard may still exist. At sources that emit higher concentrations of oxidizable materials (e.g., power plants), more HCl may be required to remove the larger amounts of brown deposit formed in the impingers. In such cases, the potential safety hazards due to sample container pressurization are greater, because of the larger volume of HCl rinse added to the recovered sample. These hazards are eliminated by storing and analyzing the HCl impinger wash separately from the permanganate impinger sample.
              6.0 Equipment and Supplies
              6.1 Sample Collection and Sample Recovery. Same as Method 101, Sections 6.1 and 6.2, respectively, with the following exceptions:
              6.1.1 Probe Liner. Same as in Method 101, Section 6.1.2, except that if a filter is used ahead of the impingers, the probe heating system must be used to minimize the condensation of gaseous Hg.
              6.1.2 Filter Holder (Optional). Borosilicate glass with a rigid stainless-steel wire-screen filter support (do not use glass frit supports) and a silicone rubber or Teflon gasket, designed to provide a positive seal against leakage from outside or around the filter. The filter holder must be equipped with a filter heating system capable of maintaining a temperature around the filter holder of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F) during sampling to minimize both water and gaseous Hg condensation. A filter may also be used in cases where the stream contains large quantities of particulate matter.

              6.2 Sample Analysis. Same as Method 101, Section 6.3, with the following additions and exceptions:
              
              6.2.1 Volumetric Pipets. Class A; 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 10-, and 20-ml.
              6.2.2 Graduated Cylinder. 25-ml.
              6.2.3 Steam Bath.
              6.2.4 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer or Equivalent. Any atomic absorption unit with an open sample presentation area in which to mount the optical cell is suitable. Instrument settings recommended by the particular manufacturer should be followed. Instruments designed specifically for the measurement of mercury using the cold-vapor technique are commercially available and may be substituted for the atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
              6.2.5 Optical Cell. Alternatively, a heat lamp mounted above the cell or a moisture trap installed upstream of the cell may be used.
              6.2.6 Aeration Cell. Alternatively, aeration cells available with commercial cold vapor instrumentation may be used.
              6.2.7 Aeration Gas Cylinder. Nitrogen, argon, or dry, Hg-free air, equipped with a single-stage regulator. Alternatively, aeration may be provided by a peristaltic metering pump. If a commercial cold vapor instrument is used, follow the manufacturer's recommendations.
              7.0 Reagents and Standards
              Unless otherwise indicated, it is intended that all reagents conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society, where such specifications are available; otherwise, use the best available grade.
              7.1 Sample Collection and Recovery. The following reagents are required for sample collection and recovery:

              7.1.1 Water. Deionized distilled, to conform to ASTM D 1193-77 or 91 Type 1. If high concentrations of organic matter are not expected to be present, the analyst may eliminate the KMnO4 test for oxidizable organic matter. Use this water in all dilutions and solution preparations.

              7.1.2 Nitric Acid, 50 Percent (V/V). Mix equal volumes of concentrated HNO3 and water, being careful to add the acid to the water slowly.

              7.1.7 Hydrochloric Acid, 8 N. Carefully add and mix 67 ml of concentrated HCl to 33 ml of water.
              7.2 Sample Analysis. The following reagents and standards are required for sample analysis:
              7.2.1 Water. Same as in Section 7.1.1.

              7.2.2 Tin (II) Solution. Prepare fresh daily, and keep sealed when not being used. Completely dissolve 20 g of tin (II) chloride (or 25 g of tin (II) sulfate) crystals (Baker Analyzed reagent grade or any other brand that will give a clear solution) in 25 ml of concentrated HCl. Dilute to 250 ml with water. Do not substitute HNO3 H2SO4, or other strong acids for the HCl.
              7.2.3 Sodium Chloride-Hydroxylamine Solution. Dissolve 12 g of sodium chloride and 12 g of hydroxylamine sulfate (or 12 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride) in water and dilute to 100 ml.
              7.2.4 Hydrochloric Acid, 8 N. Same as Section 7.1.7.

              7.2.5 Nitric Acid, 15 Percent (V/V). Carefully add 15 ml HNO3 to 85 ml of water.
              7.2.6 Antifoam B Silicon Emulsion. J.T. Baker Company (or equivalent).

              7.2.7 Mercury Stock Solution, 1 mg Hg/ml. Prepare and store all Hg standard solutions in borosilicate glass containers. Completely dissolve 0.1354 g of Hg (II) chloride in 75 ml of water. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO3, and adjust the volume to exactly 100 ml with water. Mix thoroughly. This solution is stable for at least one month.

              7.2.8 Intermediate Hg Standard Solution, 10 µg/ml. Prepare fresh weekly. Pipet 5.0 ml of the Hg stock solution (Section 7.2.7) into a 500 ml volumetric flask, and add 20 ml of 15 percent HNO3 solution. Adjust the volume to exactly 500 ml with water. Thoroughly mix the solution.

              7.2.9 Working Hg Standard Solution, 200 ng Hg/ml. Prepare fresh daily. Pipet 5.0 ml from the “Intermediate Hg Standard Solution” (Section 7.2.8) into a 250-ml volumetric flask. Add 5 ml of 4 percent KMnO4 absorbing solution and 5 ml of 15 percent HNO3. Adjust the volume to exactly 250 ml with water. Mix thoroughly.

              7.2.10 Potassium Permanganate, 5 Percent (W/V). Dissolve 5 g of KMnO4 in water and dilute to 100 ml.
              7.2.11 Filter. Whatman No. 40, or equivalent.
              8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
              Same as Method 101, Section 8.0, with the exception of the following:

              8.1 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 101, Section 8.2, except that the liberation of free iodine in the first impinger due to high Hg or sulfur dioxide concentrations is not applicable. In this method, high oxidizable organic content may make it impossible to sample for the desired minimum time. This problem is indicated by the complete bleaching of the purple color of the KMnO4 solution. In cases where an excess of water condensation is encountered, collect two runs to make one sample, or add an extra impinger in front of the first impinger (also containing acidified KMnO4 solution).
              8.2 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as Method 101, Section 8.3, with the exception of the following:

              8.2.1 In this method, clean all the glass components by rinsing with 50 percent HNO3, tap water, 8 N HCl, tap water, and finally with deionized distilled water. Then place 50 ml of absorbing solution in the first impinger and 100 ml in each of the second and third impingers.
              8.2.2 If a filter is used, use a pair of tweezers to place the filter in the filter holder. Be sure to center the filter, and place the gasket in the proper position to prevent the sample gas stream from bypassing the filter. Check the filter for tears after assembly is completed. Be sure also to set the filter heating system at the desired operating temperature after the sampling train has been assembled.
              8.3 Sampling Train Operation. In addition to the procedure outlined in Method 101, Section 8.5, maintain a temperature around the filter (if applicable) of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F).
              8.4 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 101, Section 8.7, with the exception of the following:
              8.4.1 Transfer the probe, impinger assembly, and (if applicable) filter assembly to the cleanup area.
              8.4.2 Treat the sample as follows:
              8.4.2.1 Container No. 1 (Impinger, Probe, and Filter Holder) and, if applicable, Container No. 1A (HCl rinse).

              8.4.2.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure the liquid in the first three impingers to within 1 ml. Record the volume of liquid present (e.g., see Figure 5-6 of Method 5). This information is needed to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. (Use only graduated cylinder and glass storage bottles that have been precleaned as in Section 8.2.1.) Place the contents of the first three impingers (four if an extra impinger was added as described in Section 8.1) into a 1000-ml glass sample bottle labeled Container No. 1.
              
              
                Note:
                If a filter is used, remove the filter from its holder as outlined under Section 8.4.3.
              
              
              8.4.2.1.2 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover the Hg (and any condensate) from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, front half of the filter holder (if applicable), and impingers as follows: Rinse these components with a total of 400 ml (350 ml if an extra impinger was added as described in Section 8.1) of fresh absorbing solution, carefully assuring removal of all loose particulate matter from the impingers; add all washings to the 1000 ml glass sample bottle. To remove any residual brown deposits on the glassware following the permanganate rinse, rinse with approximately 100 ml of water, carefully assuring removal of all loose particulate matter from the impingers. Add this rinse to Container No. 1.
              8.4.2.1.3 If no visible deposits remain after this water rinse, do not rinse with 8 N HCl. If deposits do remain on the glassware after the water rinse, wash impinger walls and stems with 25 ml of 8 N HCl, and place the wash in a separate container labeled Container No. 1A as follows: Place 200 ml of water in a sample container labeled Container No. 1A. Wash the impinger walls and stem with the HCl by turning the impinger on its side and rotating it so that the HCl contacts all inside surfaces. Pour the HCl wash carefully with stirring into Container No. 1A.
              8.4.2.1.4 After all washings have been collected in the appropriate sample container(s), tighten the lid(s) on the container(s) to prevent leakage during shipment to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to allow subsequent determination of whether leakage has occurred during transport. Label each container to identify its contents clearly.
              8.4.3 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.
              8.4.4 Container No. 3 (Filter). If a filter was used, carefully remove it from the filter holder, place it in a 100-ml glass sample bottle, and add 20 to 40 ml of absorbing solution. If it is necessary to fold the filter, be sure that the particulate cake is inside the fold. Carefully transfer to the 100-ml sample bottle any particulate matter and filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket by using a dry Nylon bristle brush and a sharp-edged blade. Seal the container. Label the container to identify its contents clearly. Mark the height of the fluid level to allow subsequent determination of whether leakage has occurred during transport.
              8.4.5 Container No. 4 (Filter Blank). If a filter was used, treat an unused filter from the same filter lot as that used for sampling according to the procedures outlined in Section 8.4.4.

              8.4.6 Container No. 5 (Absorbing Solution Blank). Place 650 ml of 4 percent KMnO4 absorbing solution in a 1000-ml sample bottle. Seal the container.

              8.4.7 Container No. 6 (HCl Rinse Blank). Place 200 ml of water in a 1000-ml sample bottle, and add 25 ml of 8 N HCl carefully with stirring. Seal the container. Only one blank sample per 3 runs is required.

              9.2 Volume Metering System Checks. Same as Method 5, Section 9.2.
              10.0 Calibration and Standardization
              Same as Method 101, Section 10.0, with the following exceptions:
              10.1 Optical Cell Heating System Calibration. Same as in Method 101, Section 10.4, except use a-25 ml graduated cylinder to add 25 ml of water to the bottle section of the aeration cell.
              10.2 Spectrophotometer and Recorder Calibration.

              10.2.1 The Hg response may be measured by either peak height or peak area.
              
              
                Note:
                The temperature of the solution affects the rate at which elemental Hg is released from a solution and, consequently, it affects the shape of the absorption curve (area) and the point of maximum absorbance (peak height). To obtain reproducible results, all solutions must be brought to room temperature before use.
              
              

              10.2.2 Set the spectrophotometer wave length at 253.7 nm, and make certain the optical cell is at the minimum temperature that will prevent water condensation. Then set the recorder scale as follows: Using a 25-ml graduated cylinder, add 25 ml of water to the aeration cell bottle. Add three drops of Antifoam B to the bottle, and then pipet 5.0 ml of the working Hg standard solution into the aeration cell.
              
              
                Note:
                Always add the Hg-containing solution to the aeration cell after the 25 ml of water.
              
              
              10.2.3 Place a Teflon-coated stirring bar in the bottle. Add 5 ml of absorbing solution to the aeration bottle, and mix well. Before attaching the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell, make certain that (1) the aeration cell exit arm stopcock (Figure 101-3 of Method 101) is closed (so that Hg will not prematurely enter the optical cell when the reducing agent is being added) and (2) there is no flow through the bubbler. If conditions (1) and (2) are met, attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell. Add sodium chloride-hydroxylamine in 1 ml increments until the solution is colorless. Now add 5 ml of tin (II) solution to the aeration bottle through the side arm, and immediately stopper the side arm. Stir the solution for 15 seconds, turn on the recorder, open the aeration cell exit arm stopcock, and immediately initiate aeration with continued stirring. Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.
              11.0 Analytical Procedure
              11.1 Sample Loss Check. Check the liquid level in each container to see if liquid was lost during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or use methods subject to the approval of the Administrator to account for the losses.
              11.2 Sample Preparation. Treat sample containers as follows:
              11.2.1 Containers No. 3 and No. 4 (Filter and Filter Blank).

              11.2.1.1 If a filter is used, place the contents, including the filter, of Containers No. 3 and No. 4 in separate 250-ml beakers, and heat the beakers on a steam bath until most of the liquid has evaporated. Do not heat to dryness. Add 20 ml of concentrated HNO3 to the beakers, cover them with a watch glass, and heat on a hot plate at 70 °C (160 °F) for 2 hours. Remove from the hot plate.
              11.2.1.2 Filter the solution from digestion of the Container No. 3 contents through Whatman No. 40 filter paper, and save the filtrate for addition to the Container No. 1 filtrate as described in Section 11.2.2. Discard the filter paper.
              11.2.1.3 Filter the solution from digestion of the Container No. 4 contents through Whatman No. 40 filter paper, and save the filtrate for addition to Container No. 5 filtrate as described in Section 11.2.3 below. Discard the filter paper.
              11.2.2 Container No. 1 (Impingers, Probe, and Filter Holder) and, if applicable, No. 1A (HCl rinse).

              11.2.2.1 Filter the contents of Container No. 1 through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into a 1 liter volumetric flask to remove the brown manganese dioxide (MnO2) precipitate. Save the filter for digestion of the brown MnO2 precipitate. Add the sample filtrate from Container No. 3 to the 1-liter volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water. If the combined filtrates are greater than 1000 ml, determine the volume to the nearest ml and make the appropriate corrections for blank subtractions. Mix thoroughly. Mark the filtrate as analysis Sample No. A.1 and analyze for Hg within 48 hr of the filtration step. Place the saved filter, which was used to remove the brown MnO2 precipitate, into an appropriate sized container. In a laboratory hood, add 25 ml of 8 N HCl to the filter and allow to digest for a minimum of 24 hours at room temperature.

              11.2.2.2 Filter the contents of Container 1A through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into a 500-ml volumetric flask. Then filter the digestate of the brown MnO2 precipitate from Container No. 1 through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into the same 500-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water. Mark this combined 500 ml dilute solution as analysis Sample No. A.2. Discard the filters.
              11.2.3 Container No. 5 (Absorbing Solution Blank) and No. 6 (HCl Rinse Blank).
              11.2.3.1 Treat Container No. 5 as Container No. 1 (as described in Section 11.2.2), except substitute the filter blank filtrate from Container No. 4 for the sample filtrate from Container No. 3, and mark as Sample A.1 Blank.

              11.2.3.2 Treat Container No. 6 as Container No. 1A, (as described in Section 11.2.2, except substitute the filtrate from the digested blank MnO2 precipitate for the filtrate from the digested sample MnO2 precipitate, and mark as Sample No. A.2 Blank.
              
              
                Note:
                When analyzing samples A.1 Blank and HCl A.2 Blank, always begin with 10 ml aliquots. This applies specifically to blank samples.
              
              
              11.3 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Section 10.0.
              11.3.1 Mercury Samples. Then repeat the procedure used to establish the calibration curve with appropriately sized aliquots (1 to 10 ml) of the samples (from Sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If the 10 ml sample is below the detectable limit, use a larger aliquot (up to 20 ml), but decrease the volume of water added to the aeration cell accordingly to prevent the solution volume from exceeding the capacity of the aeration bottle. If the peak maximum of a 1.0 ml aliquot is off scale, further dilute the original sample to bring the Hg concentration into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer. If the Hg content of the absorbing solution and filter blank is below the working range of the analytical method, use zero for the blank.
              11.3.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration; recalibrate as necessary.
              11.3.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Same as Method 101, Section 11.3.3.
              12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
              
                Note:

                Note:

                This dilution factor applies only to the intermediate dilution steps, since the original sample volume [(Vf)HCL] of “HCl A.2” has been factored out in the equation along with the sample aliquot (S). In Eq. 101A-1, the sample aliquot, S, is introduced directly into the aeration cell for analysis according to the procedure outlined in Section 11.3.1. A dilution factor is required only if it is necessary to bring the sample into the analytical instrument's calibration range.
              
              
                Note:
                The maximum allowable blank subtraction for the HCl is the lesser of the two following values: (1) the actual blank measured value (analysis Sample No. HCl A.2 blank), or (2) 5% of the Hg content in the combined HCl rinse and digested sample (analysis Sample No. HCl A.2).

              13.0 Method Performance

              13.1 Precision. Based on eight paired-train tests, the intra-laboratory standard deviation was estimated to be 4.8 µg/ml in the concentration range of 50 to 130 µg/m3.

              16.1 Alternative Analyzers.
              16.1.1 Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) may be used as an alternative to atomic absorption analysis provided the following conditions are met:
              16.1.1.1 Sample collection, sample preparation, and analytical preparation procedures are as defined in the method except as necessary for the ICP-AES application.
              16.1.1.2 The quality control procedures are conducted as prescribed.
              16.1.1.3 The limit of quantitation for the ICP-AES must be demonstrated and the sample concentrations reported should be no less than two times the limit of quantitation. The limit of quantitation is defined as ten times the standard deviation of the blank value. The standard deviation of the blank value is determined from the analysis of seven blanks. It has been reported that for mercury and those elements that form hydrides, a continuous-flow generator coupled to an ICP-AES offers detection limits comparable to cold vapor atomic absorption.

              16.1.2 Samples may also be analyzed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry.

              1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of Hg emissions, including both particulate and gaseous Hg, from chlor-alkali plants and other sources (as specified in the regulations) where the carrier-gas stream in the duct or stack is principally hydrogen.
              1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.
              2.0 Summary of Method
              2.1 Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and collected in acidic iodine monochloride (ICl) solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an optical cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

              5.2 Corrosive Reagents. Same as Method 101, Section 5.2.
              5.3 Explosive Mixtures. The sampler must conduct the source test under conditions of utmost safety because hydrogen and air mixtures are explosive. Since the sampling train essentially is leakless, attention to safe operation can be concentrated at the inlet and outlet. If a leak does occur, however, remove the meter box cover to avoid a possible explosive mixture. The following specific precautions are recommended:

              5.3.1 Operate only the vacuum pump during the test. The other electrical equipment, e.g., heaters, fans, and timers, normally are not essential to the success of a hydrogen stream test.
              5.3.2 Seal the sample port to minimize leakage of hydrogen from the stack.

              5.3.3 Vent sampled hydrogen at least 3 m (10 ft) away from the train. This can be accomplished by attaching a 13-mm (0.50-in.) ID Tygon tube to the exhaust from the orifice meter.
              
              
                Note:
                A smaller ID tubing may cause the orifice meter calibration to be erroneous. Take care to ensure that the exhaust line is not bent or pinched.

              6.2 Glass Fiber Filter. Do not use, unless otherwise specified.
              
              7.0 Reagents and Standards
              Same as Method 101, Section 7.0.
              8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
              Same as Method 101, Section 8.0, with the exception of the following:
              8.1 Setting of Isokinetic Rates.
              8.1.1 If a nomograph is used, take special care in the calculation of the molecular weight of the stack gas and in the setting of the nomograph to maintain isokinetic conditions during sampling (Sections 8.1.1.1 through 8.1.1.3 below).
              8.1.1.1 Calibrate the meter box orifice. Use the techniques described in APTD-0576 (see Reference 9 in Section 17.0 of Method 5 of appendix A to part 60). Calibration of the orifice meter at flow conditions that simulate the conditions at the source is suggested. Calibration should either be done with hydrogen or with some other gas having a similar Reynolds Number so that there is similarity between the Reynolds Numbers during calibration and during sampling. Alternative mercury-free thermometers may be used if the thermometers are, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.
              8.1.1.2 The nomograph described in APTD-0576 cannot be used to calculate the C factor because the nomograph is designed for use when the stack gas dry molecular weight is 29 ±4. Instead, the following calculation should be made to determine the proper C factor:
              
                ER17OC00.501
              
              Where:
              
              Bws = Fraction by volume of water vapor in the stack gas.
              Cp = Pitot tube calibration coefficient, dimensionless.
              Md = Dry molecular weight of stack gas, lb/lb-mole.
              Ps = Absolute pressure of stack gas, in. Hg.
              Pm = Absolute pressure of gas at the meter, in. Hg.
              Tm = Absolute temperature of gas at the orifice, °R.
              ΔH@ = Meter box calibration factor obtained in Section 8.1.1.1, in. H2O.
              0.00154 = (in. H2O/°R).
              
              
                Note:
                This calculation is left in English units, and is not converted to metric units because nomographs are based on English units.
              
              
              8.1.1.3 Set the calculated C factor on the operating nomograph, and select the proper nozzle diameter and K factor as specified in APTD-0576. If the C factor obtained in Section 8.1.1.2 exceeds the values specified on the existing operating nomograph, expand the C scale logarithmically so that the values can be properly located.
              8.1.2 If a calculator is used to set isokinetic rates, it is suggested that the isokinetic equation presented in Reference 13 in Section 17.0 of Method 101 be consulted.
              8.2 Sampling in Small (<12-in. Diameter) Stacks. When the stack diameter (or equivalent diameter) is less than 12 inches, conventional pitot tube-probe assemblies should not be used. For sampling guidelines, see Reference 14 in Section 17.0 of Method 101.

It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
              5.2 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Highly corrosive and toxic. Vapors are highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, producing hydrogen gas. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burn as thermal burn.
              6.0 Equipment and Supplies
              6.1 Sample Collection. A schematic of the required sampling train configuration is shown in Figure 103-1 in Section 17.0. The essential components of the train are as follows:
              6.1.1 Nozzle. Stainless steel, or equivalent, with sharp, tapered leading edge.
              6.1.2 Probe. Sheathed borosilicate or quartz glass tubing.
              6.1.3 Filter. Millipore AA, or equivalent, with appropriate filter holder that provides a positive seal against leakage from outside or around the filter. It is suggested that a Whatman 41, or equivalent, be placed immediately against the back side of the Millipore filter as a guard against breakage of the Millipore. Include the backup filter in the analysis. To be equivalent, other filters shall exhibit at least 99.95 percent efficiency (0.05 percent penetration) on 0.3 micron dioctyl phthalate smoke particles, and be amenable to the Be analysis procedure. The filter efficiency tests shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM D 2986-71, 78, 95a (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18). Test data from the supplier's quality control program are sufficient for this purpose.
              6.1.4 Meter-Pump System. Any system that will maintain isokinetic sampling rate, determine sample volume, and is capable of a sampling rate of greater than 14 lpm (0.5 cfm).
              6.2 Measurement of Stack Conditions. The following equipment is used to measure stack conditions:
              6.2.1 Pitot Tube. Type S, or equivalent, with a constant coefficient (±5 percent) over the working range.
              6.2.2 Inclined Manometer, or Equivalent. To measure velocity head to ±10 percent of the minimum value.
              6.2.3 Temperature Measuring Device. To measure stack temperature to ±1.5 percent of the minimum absolute stack temperature.
              6.2.4 Pressure Measuring Device. To measure stack pressure to ±2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in. Hg).
              6.2.5 Barometer. To measure atmospheric pressure to ±2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in. Hg).
              6.2.6 Wet and Dry Bulb Thermometers, Drying Tubes, Condensers, or Equivalent. To determine stack gas moisture content to ±1 percent.
              6.3 Sample Recovery.
              6.3.1 Probe Cleaning Equipment. Probe brush or cleaning rod at least as long as probe, or equivalent. Clean cotton balls, or equivalent, should be used with the rod.
              6.3.2 Leakless Glass Sample Bottles. To contain sample.
              6.4 Analysis. All equipment necessary to perform an atomic absorption, spectrographic, fluorometric, chromatographic, or equivalent analysis.
              7.0 Reagents and Standards

              7.1.1 Water. Deionized distilled, to conform to ASTM D 1193-77, 91 (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18), Type 3.
              7.1.2 Acetone. Reagent grade.

              7.1.3 Wash Acid, 50 Percent (V/V) Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Mix equal volumes of concentrated HCl and water, being careful to add the acid slowly to the water.
              
              7.2 Analysis. Reagents and standards as necessary for the selected analytical procedure.
              8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
              Guidelines for source testing are detailed in the following sections. These guidelines are generally applicable; however, most sample sites differ to some degree and temporary alterations such as stack extensions or expansions often are required to insure the best possible sample site. Further, since Be is hazardous, care should be taken to minimize exposure. Finally, since the total quantity of Be to be collected is quite small, the test must be carefully conducted to prevent contamination or loss of sample.
              8.1 Selection of a Sampling Site and Number of Sample Runs. Select a suitable sample site that is as close as practicable to the point of atmospheric emission. If possible, stacks smaller than one foot in diameter should not be sampled.

              8.1.1 Ideal Sampling Site. The ideal sampling site is at least eight stack or duct diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion or contraction. For rectangular cross sections, use Equation 103-1 in Section 12.2 to determine an equivalent diameter, De.
              8.1.2 Alternate Sampling Site. Some sampling situations may render the above sampling site criteria impractical. In such cases, select an alternate site no less than two diameters downstream and one-half diameter upstream from any point of flow disturbance. Additional sample runs are recommended at any sample site not meeting the criteria of Section 8.1.1.
              8.1.3 Number of Sample Runs Per Test. Three sample runs constitute a test. Conduct each run at one of three different points. Select three points that proportionately divide the diameter, or are located at 25, 50, and 75 percent of the diameter from the inside wall. For horizontal ducts, sample on a vertical line through the centroid. For rectangular ducts, sample on a line through the centroid and parallel to a side. If additional sample runs are performed per Section 8.1.2, proportionately divide the duct to accommodate the total number of runs.
              8.2 Measurement of Stack Conditions. Using the equipment described in Section 6.2, measure the stack gas pressure, moisture, and temperature to determine the molecular weight of the stack gas. Sound engineering estimates may be made in lieu of direct measurements. Describe the basis for such estimates in the test report.
              8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.
              8.3.1 Assemble the sampling train as shown in Figure 103-1. It is recommended that all glassware be precleaned by soaking in wash acid for two hours.
              8.3.2 Leak check the sampling train at the sampling site. The leakage rate should not be in excess of 1 percent of the desired sample rate.
              8.4 Sampling Train Operation.
              8.4.1 For each run, measure the velocity at the selected sampling point. Determine the isokinetic sampling rate. Record the velocity head and the required sampling rate. Place the nozzle at the sampling point with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. At the conclusion of the test, record the sampling rate. Again measure the velocity head at the sampling point. The required isokinetic rate at the end of the period should not have deviated more than 20 percent from that originally calculated. Describe the reason for any deviation beyond 20 percent in the test report.
              8.4.2 Sample at a minimum rate of 14 liters/min (0.5 cfm). Obtain samples over such a period or periods of time as are necessary to determine the maximum emissions which would occur in a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, perform sufficient sample runs so as to allow determination or calculation of the emissions that occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sampling time of two hours per run is recommended.
              8.5 Sample Recovery.
              8.5.1 It is recommended that all glassware be precleaned as in Section 8.3. Sample recovery should also be performed in an area free of possible Be contamination. When the sampling train is moved, exercise care to prevent breakage and contamination. Set aside a portion of the acetone used in the sample recovery as a blank for analysis. The total amount of acetone used should be measured for accurate blank correction. Blanks can be eliminated if prior analysis shows negligible amounts.
              8.5.2 Remove the filter (and backup filter, if used) and any loose particulate matter from filter holder, and place in a container.
              8.5.3 Clean the probe with acetone and a brush or long rod and cotton balls. Wash into the container with the filter. Wash out the filter holder with acetone, and add to the same container.

              2.0 Summary of Method
              2.1 Particulate and gaseous Be emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and are collected on a glass fiber filter and in water. The collected sample is digested in an acid solution and is analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
              3.0 Definitions [Reserved]
              
              4.0 Interferences

              4.1 Matrix Effects. Analysis for Be by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry is sensitive to the chemical composition and to the physical properties (e.g., viscosity, pH) of the sample. Aluminum and silicon, in particular, are known to interfere when present in appreciable quantities. The analytical procedure includes (optionally) the use of the Method of Standard Additions to check for these matrix effects, and sample analysis using the Method of Standard Additions if significant matrix effects are found to be present (see Reference 2 in Section 17.0).
              5.0 Safety
              5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
              5.2 Corrosive reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes.

Other materials of construction (e.g., stainless steel, Teflon, Viton) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. The holder design shall provide a positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter. The holder shall be attached immediately at the outlet of the probe. A heating system capable of maintaining the filter at a minimum temperature in the range of the stack temperature may be used to prevent condensation from occurring.
              6.1.4 Impingers. Four Greenburg-Smith impingers connected in series with leak-free ground glass fittings or any similar leak-free noncontaminating fittings. For the first, third, and fourth impingers, use impingers that are modified by replacing the tip with a 13 mm-ID (0.5 in.) glass tube extending to 13 mm (0.5 in.) from the bottom of the flask may be used.

              6.2 Sample Recovery. The following items are needed for sample recovery:

              7.0 Reagents and Standards
              
                Note:
                Unless otherwise indicated, it is intended that all reagents conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society, where such specifications are available; otherwise, use the best available grade.
              
              7.1 Sample Collection. Same as Method 5, Section 7.1, including deionized distilled water conforming to ASTM D 1193-77 or 91 (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18), Type 3. The Millipore AA filter is recommended.
              7.2 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5 in appendix A, part 60, Section 7.2, with the addition of the following:
              7.2.1 Wash Acid, 50 Percent (V/V) Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Mix equal volumes of concentrated HCl and water, being careful to add the acid slowly to the water.
              7.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis. The following reagents and standards and standards are needed for sample preparation and analysis:
              7.3.1 Water. Same as in Section 7.1.
              7.3.2. Perchloric Acid (HClO4). Concentrated (70 percent V/V).
              7.3.3 Nitric Acid (HNO3). Concentrated.
              7.3.4 Beryllium Powder. Minimum purity 98 percent.
              7.3.5 Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) Solution, 12 N. Dilute 33 ml of concentrated H2SO4 to 1 liter with water.
              7.3.6 Hydrochloric Acid Solution, 25 Percent HCl (V/V).

              7.3.7 Stock Beryllium Standard Solution, 10 µg Be/ml. Dissolve 10.0 mg of Be in 80 ml of 12 N H2SO4 in a 1000-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with water. This solution is stable for at least one month. Equivalent strength Be stock solutions may be prepared from Be salts such as BeCl2 and Be(NO3)2 (98 percent minimum purity).
              7.3.8 Working Beryllium Standard Solution, 1 µg Be/ml. Dilute a 10 ml aliquot of the stock beryllium standard solution to 100 ml with 25 percent HCl solution to give a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Prepare this dilute stock solution fresh daily.
              8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
              The amount of Be that is collected is generally small, therefore, it is necessary to exercise particular care to prevent contamination or loss of sample.
              8.1 Pretest Preparation. Same as Method 5, Section 8.1, except omit Section 8.1.3.
              8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 5, Section 8.2, with the exception of the following:
              8.2.1 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads to assure that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm).
              8.2.2 Obtain samples over a period or periods of time that accurately determine the maximum emissions that occur in a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, perform sufficient sample runs for the accurate determination of the emissions that occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sample time of 2 hours per run is recommended.
              8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as Method 5, Section 8.3, with the exception of the following:
              8.3.1 Prior to assembly, clean all glassware (probe, impingers, and connectors) by first soaking in wash acid for 2 hours, followed by rinsing with water.
              8.3.2 Save a portion of the water for a blank analysis.
              8.3.3 Procedures relating to the use of metal probe liners are not applicable.

              8.3.4 Probe and filter heating systems are needed only if water condensation is a problem. If this is the case, adjust the heaters to provide a temperature at or above the stack temperature. However, membrane filters such as the Millipore AA are limited to about 107 °C (225 °F). If the stack gas is in excess of about 93 °C (200 °F), consideration should be given to an alternate procedure such as moving the filter holder downstream of the first impinger to insure that the filter does not exceed its temperature limit. After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the probe heating system, if applicable, at the desired operating temperature. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed ice around the impingers.
              
              
                Note:
                An empty impinger may be inserted between the third impinger and the silica gel to remove excess moisture from the sample stream.
              
              

              8.4 Leak Check Procedures, Sampling Train Operation, and Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, Sections 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6, respectively.
              
              8.5 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7, except treat the sample as follows: Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to a cleanup area that is clean, protected from the wind, and free of Be contamination. Inspect the train before and during this assembly, and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the sample as follows: Disconnect the probe from the impinger train.
              8.5.1 Container No. 1. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.1.
              8.5.2 Container No. 2. Place the contents (measured to 1 ml) of the first three impingers into a glass sample bottle. Use the procedures outlined in Section 8.7.6.2 of Method 5, where applicable, to rinse the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, filter holder, and all glassware between the filter holder and the back half of the third impinger with water. Repeat this procedure with acetone. Place both water and acetone rinse solutions in the sample bottle with the contents of the impingers.
              8.5.3 Container No. 3. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.
              8.6 Blanks.

              8.6.1 Water Blank. Save a portion of the water as a blank. Take 200 ml directly from the wash bottle being used and place it in a plastic sample container labeled “H2O blank.”
              8.6.2 Filter. Save two filters from each lot of filters used in sampling. Place these filters in a container labeled “filter blank.”
              8.7 Post-test Glassware Rinsing. If an additional test is desired, the glassware can be carefully double rinsed with water and reassembled. However, if the glassware is out of use more than 2 days, repeat the initial acid wash procedure.

              10.0 Calibration and Standardization
              
                Note:
                Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
              
              10.1 Sampling Equipment. Same as Method 5, Section 10.0.
              10.2 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 ml of the 1.0 µg Be/ml working standard solution into separate 100 ml volumetric flasks, and dilute to the mark with water. The total amounts of Be in these standards are 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 µg, respectively.
              10.3 Spectrophotometer and Recorder. The Be response may be measured by either peak height or peak area. Analyze an aliquot of the 10-µg standard at 234.8 nm using a nitrous oxide/acetylene flame. Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.
              10.4 Calibration Curve.
              10.4.1 After setting the recorder scale, analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of each standard and the BLANK (see Section 11) until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value.
              10.4.3 Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak heights of the standards. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Be contamination of a reagent or carry-over of Be from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding total Be weight in the standard (in µg).
              10.5 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 µg Be) must be less than 7 percent for all standards.
              11.0 Analytical Procedure
              11.1 Sample Loss Check. Prior to analysis, check the liquid level in Container No. 2. Note on the analytical data sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or take steps, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to adjust the final results.
              11.2 Glassware Cleaning. Before use, clean all glassware according to the procedure of Section 8.3.1.

              11.3 Sample Preparation. The digestion of Be samples is accomplished in part in concentrated HClO4.
              
              
                Note:

                The sample must be heated to light brown fumes after the initial HNO3 addition; otherwise, dangerous perchlorates may result from the subsequent HClO4 digestion. HClO4 should be used only under a hood.
              
              

              11.3.1 Container No. 1. Transfer the filter and any loose particulate matter from Container No. 1 to a 150-ml beaker. Add 35 ml concentrated HNO3. To oxidize all organic matter, heat on a hotplate until light brown fumes are evident. Cool to room temperature, and add 5 ml 12 N H2SO4 and 5 ml concentrated HClO4.

              11.3.2 Container No. 2. Place a portion of the water and acetone sample into a 150 ml beaker, and put on a hotplate. Add portions of the remainder as evaporation proceeds and evaporate to dryness. Cool the residue, and add 35 ml concentrated HNO3. To oxidize all organic matter, heat on a hotplate until light brown fumes are evident. Cool to room temperature, and add 5 ml 12 N H2SO4 and 5 ml concentrated HClO4. Then proceed with step 11.3.4.

              11.3.3 Final Sample Preparation. Add the sample from Section 11.3.2 to the 150-ml beaker from Section 11.3.1. Replace on a hotplate, and evaporate to dryness in a HClO4 hood. Cool the residue to room temperature, add 10.0 ml of 25 percent V/V HCl, and mix to dissolve the residue.
              11.3.4 Filter and Water Blanks. Cut each filter into strips, and treat each filter individually as directed in Section 11.3.1. Treat the 200-ml water blank as directed in Section 11.3.2. Combine and treat these blanks as directed in Section 11.3.3.
              11.4 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current; and adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.
              11.5 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.4 and 10.5.
              11.5.1 Beryllium Samples. Repeat the procedure used to establish the calibration curve with an appropriately sized aliquot of each sample (from Section 11.3.3) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. The peak height of each sample must be greater than 10 percent of the recorder full scale. If the peak height of the sample is off scale on the recorder, further dilute the original source sample to bring the Be concentration into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer.
              11.5.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
              11.5.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Use the Method of Standard Additions (see Reference 2 in Section 17.0) to check at least one sample from each source for matrix effects on the Be results. If the results of the Method of Standard Additions procedure used on the single source sample do not agree to within 5 percent of the value obtained by the routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from the source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.
              11.6 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. (This step may be conducted in the field.)
              12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
              Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal significant figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures only after the final calculation. Other forms of the equations may be used as long as they give equivalent results.
              12.1 Nomenclature.

              16.0 Alternative Procedures
              16.1 Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) Analysis. ICP-AES may be used as an alternative to atomic absorption analysis provided the following conditions are met:
              16.1.1 Sample collection, sample preparation, and analytical preparation procedures are as defined in the method except as necessary for the ICP-AES application.
              16.1.2 Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures, including audit material analysis, are conducted as prescribed in the method. The QA acceptance conditions must be met.
              16.1.3 The limit of quantitation for the ICP-AES must be demonstrated and the sample concentrations reported should be no less than two times the limit of quantitation. The limit of quantitation is defined as ten times the standard deviation of the blank value. The standard deviation of the blank value is determined from the analysis of seven blanks. It has been reported that for mercury and those elements that form hydrides, a continuous-flow generator coupled to an ICP-AES offers detection limits comparable to cold vapor atomic absorption.
              16.2 Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) Analysis. ICP-MS may be used as an alternative to atomic absorption analysis.
              16.3 Cold Vapor Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry (CVAFS) Analysis. CVAFS may be used as an alternative to atomic absorption analysis.

A weighed portion of the sludge is digested in aqua regia and is oxidized by potassium permanganate (KMnO4). Mercury in the digested sample is then measured by the conventional spectrophotometric cold-vapor technique.

              4.1 Resolution interferences of vinyl chloride may be encountered on some sources. Therefore, the chromatograph operator should select the column and operating parameters best suited to the particular analysis requirements. The selection made is subject to approval of the Administrator. Approval is automatic, provided that confirming data are produced through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, and that the data are available for review by the Administrator. An example of this would be analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy.

              7.0 Reagents and Standards
              7.1 Analysis. The following reagents are required for analysis.
              7.1.1 Helium or Nitrogen. Purity 99.9995 percent or greater, for chromatographic carrier gas.
              7.1.2 Hydrogen. Purity 99.9995 percent or greater.
              7.1.3 Oxygen or Air. Either oxygen (purity 99.99 percent or greater) or air (less than 0.1 ppmv total hydrocarbon content), as required by detector.
              7.2 Calibration. Use one of the following options: either Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, or Section 7.2.3.
              7.2.1 Vinyl Chloride. Pure vinyl chloride gas certified by the manufacturer to contain a minimum of 99.9 percent vinyl chloride. If the gas manufacturer maintains a bulk cylinder supply of 99.9 + percent vinyl chloride, the certification analysis may have been performed on this supply, rather than on each gas cylinder prepared from this bulk supply. The date of gas cylinder preparation and the certified analysis must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the gas manufacturer to the buyer.
              7.2.2 Nitrogen. Same as described in Section 7.1.1.
              7.2.3 Cylinder Standards. Gas mixture standards (50-,10-, and 5 ppmv vinyl chloride) in nitrogen cylinders may be used to directly prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Section 10.3 if the following conditions are met: (a) The manufacturer certifies the gas composition with an accuracy of ±3 percent or better. (b) The manufacturer recommends a maximum shelf life over which the gas concentration does not change by greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. (c) The manufacturer affixes the date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf to the cylinder before shipment to the buyer.
              7.2.3.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall certify the concentration of vinyl chloride in nitrogen in each cylinder by (a) directly analyzing each cylinder and (b) calibrating his analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate his analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use as a minimum, a three point calibration curve. It is recommended that the manufacturer maintain (1) a high concentration calibration standard (between 50 and 100 ppmv) to prepare his calibration curve by an appropriate dilution technique and (2) a low-concentration calibration standard (between 5 and 10 ppmv) to verify the dilution technique used. If the difference between the apparent concentration read from the calibration curve and the true concentration assigned to the low-concentration calibration standard exceeds 5 percent of the true concentration, the manufacturer shall determine the source of error and correct it, then repeat the three-point calibration.
              7.2.3.2 Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before using a standard, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration standard (a) by comparing it to gas mixtures prepared (with 99 mole percent vinyl chloride) in accordance with the procedure described in Section 7.2.1 or (b) calibrating it against vinyl chloride cylinder Standard Reference Materials (SRM's) prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, if such SRM's are available. The agreement between the initially determined concentration value and the verification concentration value must be ±5 percent. The manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a time interval consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards sold.
              8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
              
                Note:
                Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons unfamiliar with the operation of a gas chromatograph (GC) nor by those who are unfamiliar with source sampling, because knowledge beyond the scope of this presentation is required.
              
              

              8.1 Bag Leak-Check. The following leak-check procedure is recommended, but not required, prior to sample collection. The post-test leak-check procedure is mandatory. Connect a water manometer and pressurize the bag to 5 to 10 cm H2O (2 to 4 in. H2O). Allow to stand for 10 min. Any displacement in the water manometer indicates a leak. Also, check the rigid container for leaks in this manner.
              
              
                Note:

                An alternative leak-check method is to pressurize the bag to 5 to 10 cm H2O and allow it to stand overnight. A deflated bag indicates a leak. For each sample bag in its rigid container, place a rotameter in line between the bag and the pump inlet. Evacuate the bag. Failure of the rotameter to register zero flow when the bag appears to be empty indicates a leak.
              
              
              8.2 Sample Collection. Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 106-1. Join the quick connects as illustrated, and determine that all connection between the bag and the probe are tight. Place the end of the probe at the centroid of the stack and start the pump with the needle valve adjusted to yield a flow that will fill over 50 percent of bag volume in the specific sample period. After allowing sufficient time to purge the line several times, change the vacuum line from the container to the bag and evacuate the bag until the rotameter indicates no flow. Then reposition the sample and vacuum lines and begin the actual sampling, keeping the rate proportional to the stack velocity. At all times, direct the gas exiting the rotameter away from sampling personnel. At the end of the sample period, shut off the pump, disconnect the sample line from the bag, and disconnect the vacuum line from the bag container. Protect the bag container from sunlight.
              8.3 Sample Storage. Keep the sample bags out of direct sunlight. When at all possible, analysis is to be performed within 24 hours, but in no case in excess of 72 hours of sample collection. Aluminized Mylar bag samples must be analyzed within 24 hours.
              8.4 Post-test Bag Leak-Check. Subsequent to recovery and analysis of the sample, leak-check the sample bag according to the procedure outlined in Section 8.1.

                Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
              
              
              10.1 Preparation of Vinyl Chloride Standard Gas Mixtures. (Optional Procedure-delete if cylinder standards are used.) Evacuate a 16-inch square Tedlar bag that has passed a leak-check (described in Section 8.1) and meter in 5.0 liters of nitrogen. While the bag is filling, use the 0.5-ml syringe to inject 250 µl of 99.9 + percent vinyl chloride gas through the wall of the bag. Upon withdrawing the syringe, immediately cover the resulting hole with a piece of adhesive tape. The bag now contains a vinyl chloride concentration of 50 ppmv. In a like manner use the 50 µl syringe to prepare gas mixtures having 10-and 5-ppmv vinyl chloride concentrations. Place each bag on a smooth surface and alternately depress opposite sides of the bag 50 times to further mix the gases. These gas mixture standards may be used for 10 days from the date of preparation, after which time new gas mixtures must be prepared. (Caution: Contamination may be a problem when a bag is reused if the new gas mixture standard is a lower concentration than the previous gas mixture standard.)
              10.2 Determination of Vinyl Chloride Retention Time. (This section can be performed simultaneously with Section 10.3.) Establish chromatograph conditions identical with those in Section 11.3. Determine proper attenuator position. Flush the sampling loop with helium or nitrogen and activate the sample valve. Record the injection time, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, chart speed, and attenuator setting. Record peaks and detector responses that occur in the absence of vinyl chloride. Maintain conditions with the equipment plumbing arranged identically to Section 11.2, and flush the sample loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min with one of the vinyl chloride calibration mixtures. Then activate the sample valve. Record the injection time. Select the peak that corresponds to vinyl chloride. Measure the distance on the chart from the injection time to the time at which the peak maximum occurs. This quantity divided by the chart speed is defined as the retention time. Since other organics may be present in the sample, positive identification of the vinyl chloride peak must be made.

              10.3 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve. Make a GC measurement of each gas mixture standard (described in Section 7.2.3 or 10.1) using conditions identical to those listed in Sections 11.2 and 11.3. Flush the sampling loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min with one of the standard mixtures, and activate the sample valve. Record the concentration of vinyl chloride injected (Cc), attenuator setting, chart speed, peak area, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and retention time. Record the barometric pressure. Calculate Ac, the peak area multiplied by the attenuator setting. Repeat until two consecutive injection areas are within 5 percent, then plot the average of those two values versus Cc. When the other standard gas mixtures have been similarly analyzed and plotted, draw a straight line through the points derived by the least squares method. Perform calibration daily, or before and after the analysis of each emission test set of bag samples, whichever is more frequent. For each group of sample analyses, use the average of the two calibration curves which bracket that group to determine the respective sample concentrations. If the two calibration curves differ by more than 5 percent from their mean value, then report the final results by both calibration curves.
              11.0 Analytical Procedure

              11.2 Sample Recovery. With a new piece of Teflon tubing identified for that bag, connect a bag inlet valve to the gas chromatograph sample valve. Switch the valve to receive gas from the bag through the sample loop. Arrange the equipment so the sample gas passes from the sample valve to 100-ml/min rotameter with flow control valve followed by a charcoal tube and a 1-in. H2O pressure gauge. Maintain the sample flow either by a vacuum pump or container pressurization if the collection bag remains in the rigid container. After sample loop purging is ceased, allow the pressure gauge to return to zero before activating the gas sampling valve.
              11.3 Analysis.

              11.3.1 Set the column temperature to 100 °C (210 °F) and the detector temperature to 150 °C (300 °F). When optimum hydrogen and oxygen (or air) flow rates have been determined, verify and maintain these flow rates during all chromatography operations. Using helium or nitrogen as the carrier gas, establish a flow rate in the range consistent with the manufacturer's requirements for satisfactory detector operation. A flow rate of approximately 40 ml/min should produce adequate separations. Observe the base line periodically and determine that the noise level has stabilized and that base line drift has ceased. Purge the sample loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min, shut off flow, allow the sample loop pressure to reach atmospheric pressure as indicated by the H2O manometer, then activate the sample valve. Record the injection time (the position of the pen on the chart at the time of sample injection), sample number, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, chart speed, and attenuator setting. Record the barometric pressure. From the chart, note the peak having the retention time corresponding to vinyl chloride as determined in Section 10.2. Measure the vinyl chloride peak area, Am, by use of a disc integrator, electronic integrator, or a planimeter. Measure and record the peak heights, Hm. Record Am and retention time. Repeat the injection at least two times or until two consecutive values for the total area of the vinyl chloride peak agree within 5 percent of their average. Use the average value for these two total areas to compute the bag concentration.
              11.3.2 Compare the ratio of Hm to Am for the vinyl chloride sample with the same ratio for the standard peak that is closest in height. If these ratios differ by more than 10 percent, the vinyl chloride peak may not be pure (possibly acetaldehyde is present) and the secondary column should be employed (see Section 6.3.2.2).

              11.4 Determination of Bag Water Vapor Content. Measure the ambient temperature and barometric pressure near the bag. From a water saturation vapor pressure table, determine and record the water vapor content of the bag, Bwb, as a decimal figure. (Assume the relative humidity to be 100 percent unless a lesser value is known.)
              12.0 Calculations and Data Analysis

              12.3 Vinyl Chloride Concentration. From the calibration curves prepared in Section 10.3, determine the average concentration value of vinyl chloride, Cc, that corresponds to Ac, the sample peak area.

              13.1 Analytical Range. This method is designed for the 0.1 to 50 parts per million by volume (ppmv) range. However, common gas chromatograph (GC) instruments are capable of detecting 0.02 ppmv vinyl chloride. With proper calibration, the upper limit may be extended as needed.

              1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of the vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) content of in-process wastewater samples, and the residual vinyl chloride monomer (RCVM) content of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, wet, cake, slurry, and latex samples. It cannot be used for polymer in fused forms, such as sheet or cubes. This method is not acceptable where methods from section 304(h) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. (the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972 as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977) are required.
              1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.
              2.0 Summary of Method
              2.1 The basis for this method relates to the vapor equilibrium that is established at a constant known temperature in a closed system between RVCM, PVC resin, water, and air. The RVCM in a PVC resin will equilibrate rapidly in a closed vessel, provided that the temperature of the PVC resin is maintained above the glass transition temperature of that specific resin.
              2.2 A sample of PVC or in-process wastewater is collected in a vial or bottle and is conditioned. The headspace in the vial or bottle is then analyzed for vinyl chloride using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector.
              3.0 Definitions [Reserved]
              
              4.0 Interferences
              4.1 The chromatograph columns and the corresponding operating parameters herein described normally provide an adequate resolution of vinyl chloride; however, resolution interferences may be encountered on some sources. Therefore, the chromatograph operator shall select the column and operating parameters best suited to his particular analysis requirements, subject to the approval of the Administrator. Approval is automatic provided that confirming data are produced through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, such as analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy, and that these data are made available for review by the Administrator.
              5.0 Safety
              5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
              5.2 Toxic Analyte. Care must be exercised to prevent exposure of sampling personnel to vinyl chloride, which is a carcinogen. Do not release vinyl chloride to the laboratory atmosphere during preparation of standards. Venting or purging with VCM/air mixtures must be held to a minimum. When they are required, the vapor must be routed to outside air. Vinyl chloride, even at low ppm levels, must never be vented inside the laboratory. After vials have been analyzed, the gas must be vented prior to removal of the vial from the instrument turntable. Vials must be vented through a hypodermic needle connected to an activated charcoal tube to prevent release of vinyl chloride into the laboratory atmosphere. The charcoal must be replaced prior to vinyl chloride breakthrough.
              6.0 Equipment and Supplies
              6.1 Sample Collection. The following equipment is required:
              6.1.1 Glass bottles. 60-ml (2-oz) capacity, with wax-lined screw-on tops, for PVC samples.
              6.1.2 Glass Vials. Headspace vials, with Teflon-faced butyl rubber sealing discs, for water samples.
              6.1.3 Adhesive Tape. To prevent loosening of bottle tops.
              6.2 Sample Recovery. The following equipment is required:
              6.2.1 Glass Vials. Headspace vials, with butyl rubber septa and aluminum caps. Silicone rubber is not acceptable.
              6.2.2 Analytical Balance. Capable of determining sample weight within an accuracy of ±1 percent.
              6.2.3 Vial Sealer. To seal headspace vials.
              6.2.4 Syringe. 100-ml capacity.
              6.3 Analysis. The following equipment is required:

              6.3.1 Headspace Sampler and Chromatograph. Capable of sampling and analyzing a constant amount of headspace gas from a sealed vial, while maintaining that vial at a temperature of 90 °C ±0.5 °C (194 °F ±0.9 °F). The chromatograph shall be equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Perkin-Elmer Corporation Models F-40, F-42, F-45, HS-6, and HS-100, and Hewlett-Packard Corporation Model 19395A have been found satisfactory. Chromatograph backflush capability may be required.
              6.3.2 Chromatographic Columns. Stainless steel 1 m by 3.2 mm and 2 m by 3.2 mm, both containing 50/80-mesh Porapak Q. Other columns may be used provided that the precision and accuracy of the analysis of vinyl chloride standards are not impaired and information confirming that there is adequate resolution of the vinyl chloride peak are available for review. (Adequate resolution is defined as an area overlap of not more than 10 percent of the vinyl chloride peak by an interferant peak. Calculation of area overlap is explained in Procedure 1 of appendix C to this part: “Determination of Adequate Chromatographic Peak Resolution.”) Two 1.83 m columns, each containing 1 percent Carbowax 1500 on Carbopak B, have been found satisfactory for samples containing acetaldehyde.
              6.3.3 Temperature Sensor. Range 0 to 100 °C (32 to 212 °F) accurate to 0.1 °C.
              6.3.4 Integrator-Recorder. To record chromatograms.
              6.3.5 Barometer. Accurate to 1 mm Hg.
              6.3.6 Regulators. For required gas cylinders.
              6.3.7 Headspace Vial Pre-Pressurizer. Nitrogen pressurized hypodermic needle inside protective shield.
              7.0 Reagents and Standards
              7.1 Analysis. Same as Method 106, Section 7.1, with the addition of the following:
              7.1.1 Water. Interference-free.
              7.2 Calibration. The following items are required for calibration:
              7.2.1 Cylinder Standards (4). Gas mixture standards (50-, 500-, 2000- and 4000-ppm vinyl chloride in nitrogen cylinders). Cylinder standards may be used directly to prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Section 10.3, if the following conditions are met: (a) The manufacturer certifies the gas composition with an accuracy of ±3 percent or better (see Section 7.2.1.1). (b) The manufacturer recommends a maximum shelf life over which the gas concentration does not change by greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. (c) The manufacturer affixes the date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf life to the cylinder before shipment to the buyer.
              7.2.1.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall certify the concentration of vinyl chloride in nitrogen in each cylinder by (a) directly analyzing each cylinder and (b) calibrating the analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate the analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use, as a minimum, a 3-point calibration curve. It is recommended that the manufacturer maintain (1) a high-concentration calibration standard (between 4000 and 8000 ppm) to prepare the calibration curve by an appropriate dilution technique and (2) a low-concentration calibration standard (between 50 and 500 ppm) to verify the dilution technique used. If the difference between the apparent concentration read from the calibration curve and the true concentration assigned to the low-concentration calibration standard exceeds 5 percent of the true concentration, the manufacturer shall determine the source of error and correct it, then repeat the 3-point calibration.
              7.2.1.2 Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before using, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration standard by (a) comparing it to gas mixtures prepared (with 99 mole percent vinyl chloride) in accordance with the procedure described in Section 10.1 of Method 106 or by (b) calibrating it against vinyl chloride cylinder Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, if such SRMs are available. The agreement between the initially determined concentration value and the verification concentration value must be within 5 percent. The manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a time interval consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards sold.
              8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
              8.1 Sample Collection.
              8.1.1 PVC Sampling. Allow the resin or slurry to flow from a tap on the tank or silo until the tap line has been well purged. Extend and fill a 60-ml sample bottle under the tap, and immediately tighten a cap on the bottle. Wrap adhesive tape around the cap and bottle to prevent the cap from loosening. Place an identifying label on each bottle, and record the date, time, and sample location both on the bottles and in a log book.
              8.1.2 Water Sampling. At the sampling location fill the vials bubble-free to overflowing so that a convex meniscus forms at the top. The excess water is displaced as the sealing disc is carefully placed, with the Teflon side down, on the opening of the vial. Place the aluminum seal over the disc and the neck of the vial, and crimp into place. Affix an identifying label on the bottle, and record the date, time, and sample location both on the vials and in a log book.
              8.2 Sample Storage. All samples must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection, and must be refrigerated during this period.

              10.0 Calibration and Standardization
              
                Note:
                Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
              
              10.1 Preparation of Standards. Calibration standards are prepared as follows: Place 100 µl or about two equal drops of distilled water in the sample vial, then fill the vial with the VCM/nitrogen standard, rapidly seat the septum, and seal with the aluminum cap. Use a 1/8-in. stainless steel line from the cylinder to the vial. Do not use rubber or Tygon tubing. The sample line from the cylinder must be purged (into a properly vented hood) for several minutes prior to filling the vials. After purging, reduce the flow rate to between 500 and 1000 cc/min. Place end of tubing into vial (near bottom). Position a septum on top of the vial, pressing it against the 1/8-in. filling tube to minimize the size of the vent opening. This is necessary to minimize mixing air with the standard in the vial. Each vial is to be purged with standard for 90 seconds, during which time the filling tube is gradually slid to the top of the vial. After the 90 seconds, the tube is removed with the septum, simultaneously sealing the vial. Practice will be necessary to develop good technique. Rubber gloves should be worn during the above operations. The sealed vial must then be pressurized for 60 seconds using the vial prepressurizer. Test the vial for leakage by placing a drop of water on the septum at the needle hole. Prepressurization of standards is not required unless samples have been prepressurized.
              10.2 Analyzer Calibration. Calibration is to be performed each 8-hour period the chromatograph is used. Alternatively, calibration with duplicate 50-, 500-, 2,000-, and 4,000-ppm standards (hereafter described as a four-point calibration) may be performed on a monthly basis, provided that a calibration confirmation test consisting of duplicate analyses of an appropriate standard is performed once per plant shift, or once per chromatograph carrousel operation (if the chromatograph operation is less frequent than once per shift). The criterion for acceptance of each calibration confirmation test is that both analyses of 500-ppm standards [2,000-ppm standards if dispersion resin (excluding latex resin) samples are being analyzed] must be within 5 percent of the most recent four-point calibration curve. If this criterion is not met, then a complete four-point calibration must be performed before sample analyses can proceed.

              10.3 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve. Prepare two vials each of 50-, 500-, 2,000-, and 4,000-ppm standards. Run the calibration samples in exactly the same manner as regular samples. Plot As, the integrator area counts for each standard sample, versus Cc, the concentration of vinyl chloride in each standard sample. Draw a straight line through the points derived by the least squares method.
              11.0 Analytical Procedure
              11.1 Preparation of Equipment. Install the chromatographic column and condition overnight at 160 °C (320 °F). In the first operation, Porapak columns must be purged for 1 hour at 230 °C (450 °F).
              Do not connect the exit end of the column to the detector while conditioning. Hydrogen and air to the detector must be turned off while the column is disconnected.
              11.2 Flow Rate Adjustments. Adjust flow rates as follows:
              11.2.1. Nitrogen Carrier Gas. Set regulator on cylinder to read 50 psig. Set regulator on chromatograph to produce a flow rate of 30.0 cc/min. Accurately measure the flow rate at the exit end of the column using the soap film flowmeter and a stopwatch, with the oven and column at the analysis temperature. After the instrument program advances to the “B” (backflush) mode, adjust the nitrogen pressure regulator to exactly balance the nitrogen flow rate at the detector as was obtained in the “A” mode.
              11.2.2. Vial Prepressurizer Nitrogen.
              11.2.2.1 After the nitrogen carrier is set, solve the following equation and adjust the pressure on the vial prepressurizer accordingly.
              
                ER17OC00.599
              
              Where:
              
              T1 = Ambient temperature, °K (°R).
              T2 = Conditioning bath temperature, °K (°R).
              P1 = Gas chromatograph absolute dosing pressure (analysis mode), k Pa.
              
              Pw1 = Water vapor pressure 525.8 mm Hg @ 90 °C.
              Pw2 = Water vapor pressure 19.8 mm Hg @ 22 °C.
              7.50 = mm Hg per k Pa.
              10 kPa = Factor to adjust the prepressurized pressure to slightly less than the dosing pressure.
              
              11.2.2.2 Because of gauge errors, the apparatus may over-pressurize the vial. If the vial pressure is at or higher than the dosing pressure, an audible double injection will occur. If the vial pressure is too low, errors will occur on resin samples because of inadequate time for head-space gas equilibrium. This condition can be avoided by running several standard gas samples at various pressures around the calculated pressure, and then selecting the highest pressure that does not produce a double injection. All samples and standards must be pressurized for 60 seconds using the vial prepressurizer. The vial is then placed into the 90 °C conditioning bath and tested for leakage by placing a drop of water on the septum at the needle hole. A clean, burr-free needle is mandatory.
              11.2.3. Burner Air Supply. Set regulator on cylinder to read 50 psig. Set regulator on chromatograph to supply air to burner at a rate between 250 and 300 cc/min. Check with bubble flowmeter.
              11.2.4. Hydrogen Supply. Set regulator on cylinder to read 30 psig. Set regulator on chromatograph to supply approximately 35 ±5 cc/min. Optimize hydrogen flow to yield the most sensitive detector response without extinguishing the flame. Check flow with bubble meter and record this flow.
              11.3 Temperature Adjustments. Set temperatures as follows:
              11.3.1. Oven (chromatograph column), 140 °C (280 °F).
              11.3.2. Dosing Line, 150 °C (300 °F).
              11.3.3. Injection Block, 170 °C (340 °F).
              11.3.4. Sample Chamber, Water Temperature, 90 °C ±1.0 °C (194 °F ±1.8 °F).
              11.4 Ignition of Flame Ionization Detector. Ignite the detector according to the manufacturer's instructions.
              11.5 Amplifier Balance. Balance the amplifier according to the manufacturer's instructions.
              11.6 Programming the Chromatograph. Program the chromatograph as follows:
              11.6.1. I—Dosing or Injection Time. The normal setting is 2 seconds.
              11.6.2. A—Analysis Time. The normal setting is approximately 70 percent of the VCM retention time. When this timer terminates, the programmer initiates backflushing of the first column.
              11.6.3. B—Backflushing Time. The normal setting is double the analysis time.
              11.6.4. W—Stabilization Time. The normal setting is 0.5 min to 1.0 min.
              11.6.5. X—Number of Analyses Per Sample. The normal setting is one.
              11.7. Sample Treatment. All samples must be recovered and analyzed within 24 hours after collection.

              11.7.1 Resin Samples. The weight of the resin used must be between 0.1 and 4.5 grams. An exact weight must be obtained (within ±1 percent) for each sample. In the case of suspension resins, a volumetric cup can be prepared for holding the required amount of sample. When the cup is used, open the sample bottle, and add the cup volume of resin to the tared sample vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap). Obtain the exact sample weight, add 100 ml or about two equal drops of water, and immediately seal the vial. Report this value on the data sheet; it is required for calculation of RVCM. In the case of dispersion resins, the cup cannot be used. Weigh the sample in an aluminum dish, transfer the sample to the tared vial, and accurately weigh it in the vial. After prepressurization of the samples, condition them for a minimum of 1 hour in the 90 °C (190 °F) bath. Do not exceed 5 hours. Prepressurization is not required if the sample weight, as analyzed, does not exceed 0.2 gram. It is also not required if solution of the prepressurization equation yields an absolute prepressurization value that is within 30 percent of the atmospheric pressure.
              
              
                Note:
                Some aluminum vial caps have a center section that must be removed prior to placing into sample tray. If the cap is not removed, the injection needle will be damaged.
              
              
              11.7.2 Suspension Resin Slurry and Wet Cake Samples. Decant the water from a wet cake sample, and turn the sample bottle upside down onto a paper towel. Wait for the water to drain, place approximately 0.2 to 4.0 grams of the wet cake sample in a tared vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap) and seal immediately. Then determine the sample weight (1 percent). All samples weighing over 0.2 gram, must be prepressurized prior to conditioning for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F), except as noted in Section 11.7.1. A sample of wet cake is used to determine total solids (TS). This is required for calculating the RVCM.
              11.7.3 Dispersion Resin Slurry and Latex Samples.The materials should not be filtered. Sample must be thoroughly mixed. Using a tared vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap) add approximately eight drops (0.25 to 0.35 g) of slurry or latex using a medicine dropper. This should be done immediately after mixing. Seal the vial as soon as possible. Determine sample weight (1 percent). Condition the vial for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F) in the analyzer bath. Determine the TS on the slurry sample (Section 11.10).

              11.7.4 In-process Wastewater Samples. Using a tared vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap) quickly add approximately 1 cc of water using a medicine dropper. Seal the vial as soon as possible. Determine sample weight (1 percent). Condition the vial for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F) in the analyzer bath.
              11.8 Preparation of Sample Turntable.
              11.8.1 Before placing any sample into turntable, be certain that the center section of the aluminum cap has been removed. The numbered sample vials should be placed in the corresponding numbered positions in the turntable. Insert samples in the following order:
              11.8.1.1 Positions 1 and 2. Old 2000-ppm standards for conditioning. These are necessary only after the analyzer has not been used for 24 hours or longer.
              11.8.1.2 Position 3. 50-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
              11.8.1.3 Position 4. 500-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
              11.8.1.4 Position 5. 2000-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
              11.8.1.5 Position 6. 4000-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
              11.8.1.6 Position 7. Sample No. 7 (This is the first sample of the day, but is given as 7 to be consistent with the turntable and the integrator printout.)
              11.8.2 After all samples have been positioned, insert the second set of 50-, 500-, 2000-, and 4000-ppm standards. Samples, including standards, must be conditioned in the bath of 90 °C (190 °F) for a minimum of one hour and a maximum of five hours.
              11.9 Start Chromatograph Program. When all samples, including standards, have been conditioned at 90 °C (190 °F) for at least one hour, start the analysis program according to the manufacturer's instructions. These instructions must be carefully followed when starting and stopping a program to prevent damage to the dosing assembly.
              11.10 Determination of Total Solids. For wet cake, slurry, resin solution, and PVC latex samples, determine TS for each sample by accurately weighing approximately 3 to 4 grams of sample in an aluminum pan before and after placing in a draft oven (105 to 110 °C (221 to 230 °F)). Samples must be dried to constant weight. After first weighing, return the pan to the oven for a short period of time, and then reweigh to verify complete dryness. The TS are then calculated as the final sample weight divided by initial sample weight.

              Method 107A—Determination of Vinyl Chloride Content of Solvents, Resin-Solvent Solution, Polyvinyl Chloride Resin, Resin Slurry, Wet Resin, and Latex Samples
              
                Introduction
              
              

              Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons unfamiliar with the operation of a gas chromatograph (GC) or by those who are unfamiliar with source sampling because knowledge beyond the scope of this presentation is required. Care must be exercised to prevent exposure of sampling personnel to vinyl chloride, a carcinogen.
              
              1. Applicability and Principle
              
              

              1.1 Applicability. This is an alternative method and applies to the measurement of the vinyl chloride content of solvents, resin solvent solutions, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin, wet cake slurries, latex, and fabricated resin samples. This method is not acceptable where methods from Section 304(h) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251et seq., (the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977) are required.

              1.2 Principle. The basis for this method lies in the direct injection of a liquid sample into a chromatograph and the subsequent evaporation of all volatile material into the carrier gas stream of the chromatograph, thus permitting analysis of all volatile material including vinyl chloride.
              
              2. Range and Sensitivity
              
              
              The lower limit of detection of vinyl chloride in dry PVC resin is 0.2 ppm. For resin solutions, latexes, and wet resin, this limit rises inversely as the nonvolatile (resin) content decreases.

              With proper calibration, the upper limit may be extended as needed.
              
              3. Interferences
              
              

              The chromatograph columns and the corresponding operating parameters herein described normally provide an adequate resolution of vinyl chloride. In cases where resolution interferences are encountered, the chromatograph operator shall select the column and operating parameters best suited to his particular analysis problem, subject to the approval of the Administrator. Approval is automatic, provided that the tester produces confirming data through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, such as analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy, and has the data available for review by the Administrator.
              
              4. Precision and Reproducibility
              
              
              A standard sample of latex containing 181.8 ppm vinyl chloride analyzed 10 times by the alternative method showed a standard deviation of 7.5 percent and a mean error of 0.21 percent.

              A sample of vinyl chloride copolymer resin solution was analyzed 10 times by the alternative method and showed a standard deviation of 6.6 percent at a level of 35 ppm.
              
              5. Safety
              
              

              Do not release vinyl chloride to the laboratory atmosphere during preparation of standards. Venting or purging with vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) air mixtures must be held to minimum. When purging is required, the vapor must be routed to outside air. Vinyl chloride, even at low-ppm levels, must never be vented inside the laboratory.

              8. Procedure
              
              
              8.1 Sampling. Allow the liquid or dried resin to flow from a tap on the tank, silo, or pipeline until the tap has been purged. Fill a wide-mouth pint bottle, and immediately tightly cap the bottle. Place an identifying label on each bottle and record the date, time, sample location, and material.
              8.2 Sample Treatment. Sample must be run within 24 hours.
              8.2.1 Resin Samples. Weigh 9.00 ±0.01 g of THF or DMAC in a tared 20-ml vial. Add 1.00 ±0.01 g of resin to the tared vial containing the THF or DMAC. Close the vial tightly with the screw cap, and shake or otherwise agitate the vial until complete solution of the resin is obtained. Shaking may require several minutes to several hours, depending on the nature of the resin.
              8.2.2 Suspension Resin Slurry and Wet Resin Sample. Slurry must be filtered using a small Buchner funnel with vacuum to yield a wet resin sample. The filtering process must be continued only as long as a steady stream of water is exiting from the funnel. Excessive filtration time could result in some loss of VCM. The wet resin sample is weighed into a tared 20-ml vial with THF or DMAC as described earlier for resin samples (8.2.1) and treated the same as the resin sample. A sample of the wet resin is used to determine total solids as required for calculating the residual VCM (Section 8.3.4).
              8.2.3 Latex and Resin Solvent Solutions. Samples must be thoroughly mixed. Weigh 1.00 ±0.01 g of the latex or resin-solvent solution into a 20-ml vial containing 9.00 ±0.01 g of THF or DMAC as for the resin samples (8.2.1). Cap and shake until complete solution is obtained. Determine the total solids of the latex or resin solution sample (Section 8.3.4).
              8.2.4 Solvents and Non-viscous Liquid Samples. No preparation of these samples is required. The neat samples are injected directly into the GC.
              8.3 Analysis.
              8.3.1 Preparation of GC. Install the chromatographic column, and condition overnight at 70 °C. Do not connect the exit end of the column to the detector while conditioning.
              8.3.1.1 Flow Rate Adjustments. Adjust the flow rate as follows:
              a. Nitrogen Carrier Gas. Set regulator on cylinder to read 60 psig. Set column flow controller on the chromatograph using the soap film flowmeter to yield a flow rate of 40 cc/min.
              b. Burner Air Supply. Set regulator on the cylinder at 40 psig. Set regulator on the chromatograph to supply air to the burner to yield a flow rate of 250 to 300 cc/min using the flowmeter.

              c. Hydrogen. Set regulator on cylinder to read 60 psig. Set regulator on the chromatograph to supply 30 to 40 cc/min using the flowmeter. Optimize hydrogen flow to yield the most sensitive detector response without extinguishing the flame. Check flow with flowmeter and record this flow.
              
              d. Nitrogen Back Flush Gas. Set regulator on the chromatograph using the soap film flowmeter to yield a flow rate of 40 cc/min.
              8.3.1.2 Temperature Adjustments. Set temperature as follows:
              a. Oven (chromatographic column) at 70 °C.
              b. Injection Port at 100 °C.
              c. Detector at 300 °C.
              8.3.1.3 Ignition of Flame Ionization Detector. Ignite the detector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Allow system to stabilize approximately 1 hour.
              8.3.1.4 Recorder. Set pen at zero and start chart drive.
              8.3.1.5 Attenuation. Set attenuation to yield desired peak height depending on sample VCM content.
              8.3.2 Chromatographic Analyses.
              a. Sample Injection. Remove needle from 50-microliter syringe. Open sample vial and draw 50-microliters of THF or DMAC sample recovery solution into the syringe. Recap sample vial. Attach needle to the syringe and while holding the syringe vertically (needle uppermost), eject 40 microliters into an absorbent tissue. Wipe needle with tissue. Now inject 10 microliters into chromatograph system. Repeat the injection until two consecutive values for the height of the vinyl chloride peak do not vary more than 5 percent. Use the average value for these two peak heights to compute the sample concentration.
              b. Back Flush. After 4 minutes has elapsed after sample injection, actuate the back flush valve to purge the first 4 feet of the chromatographic column of solvent and other high boilers.
              c. Sample Data. Record on the chromatograph strip chart the data from the sample label.
              d. Elution Time. Vinyl chloride elutes at 2.8 minutes. Acetaldehyde elutes at 3.7 minutes. Analysis is considered complete when chart pen becomes stable. After 5 minutes, reset back flush valve and inject next sample.
              8.3.3 Chromatograph Servicing.
              a. Septum. Replace after five sample injections.
              b. Sample Port Liner. Replace the sample port liner with a clean spare after five sample injections.
              c. Chromatograph Shutdown. If the chromatograph has been shut down overnight, rerun one or more samples from the preceding day to test stability and precision prior to starting on the current day's work.
              8.3.4 Determination of Total Solids (TS). For wet resin, resin solution, and PVC latex samples, determine the TS for each sample by accurately weighing approximately 3 to 5 grams of sample into a tared aluminum pan. The initial procedure is as follows:
              a. Where water is the major volatile component: Tare the weighing dish, and add 3 to 5 grams of sample to the dish. Weigh to the nearest milligram.
              b. Where volatile solvent is the major volatile component: Transfer a portion of the sample to a 20-ml screw cap vial and cap immediately. Weigh the vial to the nearest milligram. Uncap the vial and transfer a 3- to 5-gram portion of the sample to a tared aluminum weighing dish. Recap the vial and reweigh to the nearest milligram. The vial weight loss is the sample weight.

              To continue, place the weighing pan in a 130 °C oven for 1 hour. Remove the dish and allow to cool to room temperature in a desiccator. Weigh the pan to the nearest 0.1 mg. Total solids is the weight of material in the aluminum pan after heating divided by the net weight of sample added to the pan originally times 100.
              
              9. Calibration of the Chromatograph
              
              
              9.1 Preparation of Standards. Prepare a 1 percent by weight (approximate) solution of vinyl chloride in THF or DMAC by bubbling vinyl chloride gas from a cylinder into a tared 125-ml glass-stoppered flask containing THF or DMAC. The weight of vinyl chloride to be added should be calculated prior to this operation, i.e., 1 percent of the weight of THF or DMAC contained in the tared flask. This must be carried out in a laboratory hood. Adjust the vinyl chloride flow from the cylinder so that the vinyl chloride dissolves essentially completely in the THF or DMAC and is not blown to the atmosphere. Take particular care not to volatize any of the solution. Stopper the flask and swirl the solution to effect complete mixing. Weigh the stoppered flask to nearest 0.1 mg to determine the exact amount of vinyl chloride added.
              Pipet 10 ml of the approximately 1 percent solution into a 100-ml glass-stoppered volumetric flask, and add THF or DMAC to fill to the mark. Cap the flask and invert 10 to 20 times. This solution contains approximately 1,000 ppm by weight of vinyl chloride (note the exact concentration).
              Pipet 50-, 10-, 5-, 1-, 0.5-, and 0.1-ml aliquots of the approximately 1,000 ppm solution into 10 ml glass stoppered volumetric flasks. Dilute to the mark with THF or DMAC, cap the flasks and invert each 10 to 20 times. These solutions contain approximately 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, and 1 ppm vinyl chloride. Note the exact concentration of each one. These standards are to be kept under refrigeration in stoppered bottles, and must be renewed every 3 months.
              9.2 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve.

              Obtain the GC for each of the six final solutions prepared in Section 9.1 by using the procedure in Section 8.3.2. Prepare a chart plotting peak height obtained from the chromatogram of each solution versus the known concentration. Draw a straight line through the points derived by the least squares method.

              8.7.1.4 Weigh the contents of Container No. 4 to within 0.5 g. Record in the log the weight of liquid along with a notation of any color or film observed in the impinger catch. The weight of liquid is needed along with the silica gel data to calculate the stack gas moisture content.
              
                Note:
                Measure and record the total amount of 0.1 N NaOH used for rinsing under Sections 8.7.1.5 and 8.7.1.6.
              
              8.7.1.5 Pour approximately 30 ml of 0.1 NaOH into each of the first two impingers, and agitate the impingers. Drain the 0.1 N NaOH through the outlet arm of each impinger into Container Number 4. Repeat this operation a second time; inspect the impingers for any abnormal conditions.
              8.7.1.6 Wipe the ball joints of the glassware connecting the impingers and the back half of the filter holder free of silicone grease, and rinse each piece of glassware twice with 0.1 N NaOH; transfer this rinse into Container Number 4. (DO NOT RINSE or brush the glass-fritted filter support.) Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the container to identify clearly its contents.
              8.8 Blanks.
              8.8.1 Sodium Hydroxide. Save a portion of the 0.1 N NaOH used for cleanup as a blank. Take 200 ml of this solution directly from the wash bottle being used and place it in a plastic sample container labeled “NaOH blank.”

              8.8.2 Water. Save a sample of the water, and place it in a container labeled “H2O blank.”

              8.8.3 Filter. Save two filters from each lot of filters used in sampling. Place these filters in a container labeled “filter blank.”

              9.2 Volume Metering System Checks. Same as Method 5, Section 9.2.
              10.0 Calibration and Standardization
              
                Note:
                Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
              
              10.1 Sampling Equipment. Same as Method 5, Section 10.0.
              10.2 Preparation of Standard Solutions.

              10.2.1 For the high level procedure, pipet 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 ml of the 1.0 mg As/ml stock solution into separate 100 ml volumetric flasks, each containing 5 ml of concentrated HNO3. Dilute to the mark with water.
              10.2.2 For the low level vapor generator procedure, pipet 1, 2, 3, and 5 ml of 1.0 µg As/ml standard solution into separate reaction tubes. Dilute to the mark with water.

              10.2.3 For the low level graphite furnace procedure, pipet 1, 5, 10 and 15 ml of 1.0 µg As/ml standard solution into separate flasks along with 2 ml of the 5 percent nickel nitrate solution and 10 ml of the 3 percent H2O2 solution. Dilute to the mark with water.
              10.3 Calibration Curve. Analyze a 0.8 N HNO3 blank and each standard solution according to the procedures outlined in section 11.4.1. Repeat this procedure on each standard solution until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value. Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak height of each standard solution. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is As contamination of a reagent or carry-over of As from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding final total As weight in the solution.

              10.4 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 mg As for the high-level procedure) must be less than 7 percent for all standards.
              
                Note:
                For instruments equipped with direct concentration readout devices, preparation of a standard curve will not be necessary. In all cases, follow calibration and operational procedures in the manufacturers' instruction manual.
              
              11.0 Analytical Procedure
              11.1 Sample Loss Check. Prior to analysis, check the liquid level in Containers Number 2 and Number 4. Note on the analytical data sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or take steps, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to adjust the final results.
              11.2 Sample Preparation.

              11.2.1 Container Number 1 (Filter). Place the filter and loose particulate matter in a 150 ml beaker. Also, add the filtered solid material from Container Number 2 (see Section 11.2.2). Add 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH. Then stir and warm on a hot plate at low heat (do not boil) for about 15 minutes. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO3, bring to a boil, then simmer for about 15 minutes. Filter the solution through a glass fiber filter. Wash with hot water, and catch the filtrate in a clean 150 ml beaker. Boil the filtrate, and evaporate to dryness. Cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO3, and then warm and stir. Allow to cool. Transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.
              11.2.2 Container Number 2 (Probe Wash).
              11.2.2.1 Filter (using a glass fiber filter) the contents of Container Number 2 into a 200 ml volumetric flask. Combine the filtered (solid) material with the contents of Container Number 1 (Filter).

              11.2.2.2 Dilute the filtrate to exactly 200 ml with water. Then pipet 50 ml into a 150 ml beaker. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO3, bring to a boil, and evaporate to dryness. Allow to cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO3, and then warm and stir. Allow the solution to cool, transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.

              11.2.3 Container Number 4 (Impinger Solution). Transfer the contents of Container Number 4 to a 500 ml volumetric flask, and dilute to exactly 500-ml with water. Pipet 50 ml of the solution into a 150-ml beaker. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO3, bring to a boil, and evaporate to dryness. Allow to cool, add 5 ml of 50 percent HNO3, and then warm and stir. Allow the solution to cool, transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with water, and mix well.
              11.2.4 Filter Blank. Cut each filter into strips, and treat each filter individually as directed in Section 11.2.1, beginning with the sentence, “Add 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH.”
              11.2.5 Sodium Hydroxide and Water Blanks. Treat separately 50 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and 50 ml water, as directed under Section 11.2.3, beginning with the sentence, “Pipet 50 ml of the solution into a 150-ml beaker.”
              11.3 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current. Adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.
              11.4 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.2 through 10.4.

              11.4.1 Arsenic Samples. Analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of each diluted sample (from Sections 11.2.1 through 11.2.3) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If applicable, follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.4.1.1. If the sample concentration falls outside the range of the calibration curve, make an appropriate dilution with 0.8 N HNO3 so that the final concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the calibration curve, determine the arsenic concentration in each sample fraction.
              
              
                Note:
                Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.
              
              
              11.4.1.1 Arsenic Determination at Low Concentration. The lower limit of flame AAS is 10 µg As/ml. If the arsenic concentration of any sample is at a lower level, use the graphite furnace or vapor generator which is available as an accessory component. Flame, graphite furnace, or vapor generators may be used for samples whose concentrations are between 10 and 30 µg/ml. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in the use of such equipment.

              11.4.1.1.1 Vapor Generator Procedure. Place a sample containing between 0 and 5 µg of arsenic in the reaction tube, and dilute to 15 ml with water. Since there is some trial and error involved in this procedure, it may be necessary to screen the samples by conventional atomic absorption until an approximate concentration is determined. After determining the approximate concentration, adjust the volume of the sample accordingly. Pipet 15 ml of concentrated HCl into each tube. Add 1 ml of 30 percent KI solution. Place the reaction tube into a 50 °C (120 °F) water bath for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Connect the reaction tube to the vapor generator assembly. When the instrument response has returned to baseline, inject 5.0 ml of 5 percent NaBH4, and integrate the resulting spectrophotometer signal over a 30-second time period.

              11.4.1.1.2 Graphite Furnace Procedure. Dilute the digested sample so that a 5 ml aliquot contains less than 1.5 µg of arsenic. Pipet 5 ml of this digested solution into a 10-ml volumetric flask. Add 1 ml of the 1 percent nickel nitrate solution, 0.5 ml of 50 percent HNO3, and 1 ml of the 3 percent hydrogen peroxide and dilute to 10 ml with water. The sample is now ready for analysis.
              11.4.1.2 Run a blank (0.8 N HNO3) and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
              11.4.1.3 Determine the arsenic concentration in the filter blank (i.e., the average of the two blank values from each lot).
              11.4.2 Container Number 3 (Silica Gel). This step may be conducted in the field. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g; record this weight.
              11.5 Check for matrix effects on the arsenic results. Same as Method 12, Section 11.5.

              10.0 Calibration and Standardizations
              
                Note:
                Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
              

              10.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 5, 10, and 25 ml of the stock As solution into separate 100-ml volumetric flasks. Add 10 ml KCl solution and dilute to the mark with 0.5 N HNO3. This will give standard concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 250 µg As/ml. For low-level arsenic samples that require the use of a graphite furnace or vapor generator, follow the procedures in Section 11.3:1. Dilute 10 ml of KCl solution to 100 ml with 0.5 N HNO3 and use as a reagent blank.

              10.2 Calibration Curve. Analyze the reagent blank and each standard solution according to the procedures outlined in Section 11.3. Repeat this procedure on each standard solution until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value. Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak heights of each standard solution. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Hg contamination of a reagent or carry-over of As from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding final total As weight in the solution.
              10.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations must be less than 7 percent for all standards.
              
                Note:
                For instruments equipped with direct concentration readout devices, preparation of a standard curve will not be necessary. In all cases, follow calibration and operational procedures in the manufacturer's instruction manual.
              
              11.0 Analytical Procedure

              11.1 Sample Preparation. Weigh 50 to 500 mg of finely pulverized sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample into the Teflon cup of the digestion bomb, and add 2 ml each of concentrated HNO3 and HF. Seal the bomb immediately to prevent the loss of any volatile arsenic compounds that may form. Heat in an oven at 105 °C (221 °F) for 2 hours. Remove the bomb from the oven and allow to cool. Using a Teflon filter, quantitatively filter the digested sample into a 50-ml polypropylene volumetric flask. Rinse the bomb three times with small portions of 0.5 N HNO3, and filter the rinses into the flask. Add 5 ml of KCl solution to the flask, and dilute to 50 ml with 0.5 N HNO3.
              11.2 Spectrophotometer Preparation.
              11.2.1 Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current. Adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.
              11.2.2 Develop a spectrophotometer calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.2 and 10.3.

              11.3 Arsenic Determination. Analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of each diluted sample (from Section 11.1) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If applicable, follow the procedures outlined in Section 11.3.1. If the sample concentration falls outside the range of the calibration curve, make an appropriate dilution with 0.5 N HNO3 so that the final concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the calibration curve, determine the As concentration in each sample.
              
                Note:
                Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.
              
              11.3.1 Arsenic Determination at Low Concentration. The lower limit of flame AAS is 10 µg As/ml. If the arsenic concentration of any sample is at a lower level, use the vapor generator or graphite furnace which is available as an accessory component. Flame, graphite furnace, or vapor generators may be used for samples whose concentrations are between 10 and 30 µg/ml. Follow the manufacturer's instructions in the use of such equipment.

              11.3.1.1 Vapor Generator Procedure. Place a sample containing between 0 and 5 µg of arsenic in the reaction tube, and dilute to 15 ml with water. Since there is some trial and error involved in this procedure, it may be necessary to screen the samples by conventional AAS until an approximate concentration is determined. After determining the approximate concentration, adjust the volume of the sample accordingly. Pipet 15 ml of concentrated HCl into each tube. Add 1 ml of 30 percent KI solution. Place the reaction tube into a 50 °C (120 °F) water bath for 5 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Connect the reaction tube to the vapor generator assembly. When the instrument response has returned to baseline, inject 5.0 ml of 5 percent NaBH4 and integrate the resulting spectrophotometer signal over a 30-second time period.

              11.3.1.2 Graphite Furnace Procedure. Pipet 5 ml of the digested solution into a 10-ml volumetric flask. Add 1 ml of the 1 percent nickel nitrate solution, 0.5 ml of 50 percent HNO3, and 1 ml of the 3 percent H2O2, and dilute to 10 ml with water. The sample is now ready to inject in the furnace for analysis.
              11.4 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
              11.5 Mandatory Check for Matrix Effects on the Arsenic Results. Same as Method 12, Section 11.5.
              12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
              12.1 Calculate the percent arsenic in the ore sample as follows:
              
                
                ER17OC00.524
              
              Where:
              
              Ca = Concentration of As as read from the standard curve, µg/ml.
              Fd = Dilution factor (equals to 1 if the sample has not been diluted).
              W = Weight of ore sample analyzed, mg.
              5 = (50 ml sample “ 100)/(103 µg/mg).
              13.0 Method Performance
              13.1 Sensitivity. The lower limit of flame AAS is 10 µg As/ml. The analytical procedure includes provisions for the use of a graphite furnace or vapor generator for samples with a lower arsenic concentration.

              15.0 Waste Management. [Reserved]
              
              16.0 Alternative Procedures
              16.1 Alternative Analyzer. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) may be used as an alternative to atomic absorption analysis provided the following conditions are met:
              16.1.1 Sample collection, sample preparation, and analytical preparation procedures are as defined in the method except as necessary for the ICP-AES application.
              16.1.2 Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures, including audit material analysis, are conducted as prescribed in the method. The QA acceptance conditions must be met.
              16.1.3 The limit of quantitation for the ICP-AES must be demonstrated and the sample concentrations reported should be no less than two times the limit of quantitation. The limit of quantitation is defined as ten times the standard deviation of the blank value. The standard deviation of the blank value is determined from the analysis of seven blanks. It has been reported that for mercury and those elements that form hydrides, a continuous-flow generator coupled to an ICP-AES offers detection limits comparable to cold vapor atomic absorption.

                Note:
                Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
              

              10.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 5, 10, and 25 ml of the stock As solution into separate 100-ml volumetric flasks. Add 2 ml of HClO4, 10 ml of HCl, and dilute to the mark with water. This will provide standard concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 250 µg As/ml.
              10.2 Calibration Curve and Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Same as Method 108A, Sections 10.2 and 10.3
              11.0 Analytical Procedure

              11.1 Sample Preparation. Weigh 100 to 1000 mg of finely pulverized sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample to a 150-ml Teflon beaker. Dissolve the sample by adding 15 ml of HNO3, 10 ml of HCl, 10 ml of HF, and 10 ml of HClO4 in the exact order as described, and let stand for 10 minutes. In a HClO4 fume hood, heat on a hot plate until 2-3 ml of HClO4 remain, then cool. Add 20 ml of water and 10 ml of HCl. Cover and warm until the soluble salts are in solution. Cool, and transfer quantitatively to a 100-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to the mark with water.
              11.2 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Same as in Method 108A, Section 11.2.

              11.3 Arsenic Determination. If the sample concentration falls outside the range of the calibration curve, make an appropriate dilution with 2 percent HClO4/10 percent HCl (prepared by diluting 2 ml concentrated HClO4 and 10 ml concentrated HCl to 100 ml with water) so that the final concentration falls within the range of the curve. Using the calibration curve, determine the As concentration in each sample.
              
                Note:
                Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instrument manufacturer's detailed operating instructions should be followed.
              
              Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected average peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.

                Note:
                Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
              

              10.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Transfer 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, and 20.0 ml of standard arsenic solution (10 µg/ml) to each of seven 50-ml volumetric flasks. Dilute to 20 ml with dilute HCl. Add one drop of methyl orange solution and neutralize to the yellow color with dropwise addition of NH4OH. Just bring back to the red color by dropwise addition of dilute HCl, and add 10 ml in excess. Proceed with the color development as described in Section 11.2.
              10.2 Calibration Curve. Plot the spectrophotometric readings of the calibration solutions against µg As per 50 ml of solution. Use this curve to determine the As concentration of each sample.
              10.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations must be less than 7 percent for all standards.
              11.0 Analytical Procedure
              11.1 Sample Preparation.

              11.1.1 Weigh 1.0 g of finely pulverized sample to the nearest 0.1 mg. Transfer the sample to a 300 ml Erlenmeyer flask and add 15 ml of HNO3, 4 ml HCl, 2 ml HF, 3 ml HClO4, and 15 ml H2SO4, in the order listed. In a HClO4 fume hood, heat on a hot plate to decompose the sample. Then heat while swirling over an open flame until dense white fumes evolve. Cool, add 15 ml of water, swirl to hydrate the H2SO4 completely, and add several boiling granules. Cool to room temperature.
              11.1.2 Add 1 g of KBr, 1 g hydrazine sulfate, and 50 ml HCl. Immediately attach the distillation head with thermometer and dip the side arm into a 50-ml graduated cylinder containing 25 ml of water and 2 ml of bromine water. Keep the graduated cylinder immersed in a beaker of cold water during distillation. Distill until the temperature of the vapor in the flask reaches 107 °C (225 °F). When distillation is complete, remove the flask from the hot plate, and simultaneously wash down the side arm with water as it is removed from the cylinder.

              11.1.3 If the expected arsenic content is in the range of 0.0020 to 0.10 percent, dilute the distillate to the 50-ml mark of the cylinder with water, stopper, and mix. Transfer a 5.0-ml aliquot to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of water and a boiling granule. Place the flask on a hot plate, and heat gently until the bromine is expelled and the color of methyl orange indicator persists upon the addition of 1 to 2 drops. Cool the flask to room temperature. Neutralize just to the yellow color of the indicator with dropwise additions of NH4OH. Bring back to the red color by dropwise addition of dilute HCl, and add 10 ml excess. Proceed with the molybdenum blue color development as described in Section 11.2.

              11.1.4 If the expected arsenic content is in the range of 0.0002 to 0.0010 percent As, transfer either the entire initial distillate or the measured remaining distillate from Section 11.1.2 to a 250-ml beaker. Wash the cylinder with two successive portions of concentrated HNO3, adding each portion to the distillate in the beaker. Add 4 ml of concentrated HClO4, a boiling granule, and cover with a flat watch glass placed slightly to one side. Boil gently on a hot plate until the volume is reduced to approximately 10 ml. Add 3 ml of HNO3, and continue the evaporation until HClO4 is refluxing on the beaker cover. Cool briefly, rinse the underside of the watch glass and the inside of the beaker with about 3-5 ml of water, cover, and continue the evaporation to expel all but 2 ml of the HClO4.
              
              
                Note:

                If the solution appears cloudy due to a small amount of antimony distilling over, add 4 ml of 50 percent HCl and 5 ml of water, cover, and warm gently until clear. If cloudiness persists, add 5 ml of HNO3 and 2 ml H2SO4. Continue the evaporation of volatile acids to solubilize the antimony until dense white fumes of H2SO4 appear. Retain at least 1 ml of the H2SO4.
              
              
              11.1.5 To the 2 ml of HClO4 solution or 1 ml of H2SO4 solution, add 15 ml of water, boil gently for 2 minutes, and then cool. Proceed with the molybdenum blue color development by neutralizing the solution directly in the beaker just to the yellow indicator color by dropwise addition of NH4OH. Obtain the red color by dropwise addition of dilute HCl. Transfer the solution to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the beaker successively with 10 ml of dilute HCl, followed by several small portions of water. At this point the volume of solution in the flask should be no more than 40 ml. Continue with the color development as described in Section 11.2.
              11.2 Analysis.
              11.2.1 Add 1 ml of KBrO3 solution to the flask and heat on a low-temperature hot plate to about 50 °C (122 °F) to oxidize the arsenic and methyl orange. Add 5.0 ml of ammonium molybdate solution to the warm solution and mix. Add 2.0 ml of hydrazine sulfate solution, dilute until the solution comes within the neck of the flask, and mix. Place the flask in a 400 ml beaker, 80 percent full of boiling water, for 10 minutes. Enough heat must be supplied to prevent the water bath from cooling much below the boiling point upon inserting the volumetric flask. Remove the flask, cool to room temperature, dilute to the mark, and mix.
              11.2.2 Transfer a suitable portion of the reference solution to an absorption cell, and adjust the spectrophotometer to the initial setting using a light band centered at 660 nm. While maintaining this spectrophotometer adjustment, take the readings of the calibration solutions followed by the samples.

This method is applicable for the determination of the polonium-210 content of particulate matter samples collected from stationary source exhaust stacks, and for the use of these data to calculate polonium-210 emissions from individual sources and from all affected sources at a facility.
              1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.
              2.0 Summary of Method

              A particulate matter sample, collected according to Method 5, is analyzed for polonium-210 content: the polonium-210 in the sample is put in solution, deposited on a metal disc, and the radioactive disintegration rate measured. Polonium in acid solution spontaneously deposits on surfaces of metals that are more electropositive than polonium. This principle is routinely used in the radiochemical analysis of polonium-210. Data reduction procedures are provided, allowing the calculation of polonium-210 emissions from individual sources and from all affected sources at a facility, using data obtained from Methods 2 and 5 and from the analytical procedures herein.

              11.0 Analytical Procedure
              
                Note:
                Perform duplicate analyses of all samples, including background counts and Method 5 samples. Duplicate measurements are considered acceptable when the difference between them is less than two standard deviations as described in EPA 600/4-77-001 or subsequent revisions.
              

              11.1 Determination of Procedure Background. Background counts used in all equations are determined by performing the specific analysis required using the analytical reagents only. All procedure background counts and sample counts for the internal proportional counter should utilize a counting time of 100 minutes; for the alpha spectrometry system, 1000 minutes. These background counts should be performed no less frequently than once per 10 sample analyses.
              
              11.2 Determination of Instrument Background. Instrument backgrounds of the internal proportional counter and the alpha spectrometry system should be determined on a weekly basis. Instrument background should not exceed procedure background. If this occurs, it may be due to a malfunction or contamination, and should be corrected before use.
              11.4 Sample Preparation. Treat the Method 5 samples [i.e., the glass fiber filter (Container No. 1) and the acetone rinse (Container No. 2)] as follows:
              11.4.1 Container No. 1. Transfer the filter and any loose particulate matter from the sample container to a 150-ml Teflon beaker.
              11.4.2 Container No. 2. Note the level of liquid in the container, and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Transfer the contents to a 400-ml glass beaker. Add polonium-209 tracer solution to the glass beaker in an amount approximately equal to the amount of polonium-210 expected in the total particulate sample. Record the activity of the tracer solution added. Add 16 M nitric acid to the beaker to digest and loosen the residue.

              11.4.3 Transfer the contents of the glass beaker to the Teflon beaker containing the glass fiber filter. Rinse the glass beaker with 16 M HNO3. If necessary, reduce the volume in the beaker by evaporation until all of the nitric acid HNO3 from the glass beaker has been transferred to the Teflon beaker.

              11.4.4 Add 30 ml of 29 M HF to the Teflon beaker and evaporate to near dryness on a hot plate in a properly operating hood.
              
              
                Note:
                Do not allow the residue to go to dryness and overheat; this will result in loss of polonium.
              
              
              11.4.5 Repeat step 11.4.4 until the filter is dissolved.
              11.4.6 Add 100 ml of 16 M HNO3 to the residue in the Teflon beaker and evaporate to near dryness.
              
              
                Note:
                Do not allow the residue to go to dryness.
              
              
              11.4.7 Add 50 ml of 16 M HNO3 and 10 ml of 12 M perchloric acid to the Teflon beaker and heat until dense fumes of perchloric acid are evolved.
              11.4.8 Repeat steps 11.4.4 to 11.4.7 as necessary until sample is completely dissolved.
              11.4.9 Add 10 ml of 12 M HCl to the Teflon beaker and evaporate to dryness. Repeat additions and evaporations several times.
              11.4.10 Transfer the sample to a 250-ml volumetric flask and dilute to volume with 3 M HCl.
              11.5 Sample Screening. To avoid contamination of the alpha spectrometry system, check each sample as follows:
              11.5.1 Add 20 ml of 1 M HCl, 1 ml of the lanthanum carrier solution (0.1 mg La/ml), a 1 ml aliquot of the sample solution from Section 11.4.10, and 3 ml of 15 M ammonium hydroxide to a 250-ml beaker in the order listed. Allow this solution to stand for a minimum of 30 minutes.
              11.5.2 Filter the solution through a filter membrane using the suction filter apparatus. Wash the filter membrane with 10 ml of water and 5 ml of ethanol, and allow the filter membrane to air dry on the filter apparatus.
              11.5.3 Carefully remove the filter membrane and mount it, filtration side up, with double-side tape on the inner surface of a planchet. Place the planchet in an internal proportional counter, and count for 100 minutes.
              11.5.4 Calculate the activity of the sample using Eq. 111-4 in Section 12.5.
              11.5.5 Determine the aliquot volume of the sample solution from Section 11.4.10 to be analyzed for polonium-210, such that the aliquot contains an activity between 1 and 4 picocuries. Use Eq. 111-5 in Section 12.6.
              11.6 Preparation of Silver Disc for Spontaneous Electrodeposition.
              11.6.1 Clean both sides of the polished silver disc with silver cleaner and with degreaser.
              11.6.2 Place disc on absorbent paper and spray one side with epoxy spray enamel. This should be carried out in a well-ventilated area, with the disc lying flat to keep paint on one side only. Allow paint to dry for 24 hours before using disc for deposition.
              11.7 Sample Analysis.

              11.7.1 Add the aliquot of sample solution from Section 11.4.10 to be analyzed for polonium-210, the volume of which was determined in Section 11.5.5, to a suitable 200-ml container to be placed in a constant temperature bath.
              
              
                Note:
                Aliquot volume may require a larger container.
              
              
              11.7.2 If necessary, bring the volume to 100 ml with 1 M HCl. If the aliquot volume exceeds 100 ml, use total aliquot.
              11.7.3 Add 200 mg of ascorbic acid and heat solution to 85 °C (185 °F) in a constant temperature bath.
              11.7.4 Suspend a silver disc in the heated solution using a glass or plastic rod with a hook inserted through the hole in the disc. The disc should be totally immersed in the solution, and the solution must be stirred constantly, at all times during the plating operation. Maintain the disc in solution for 3 hours.
              11.7.5 Remove the silver disc, rinse with deionized distilled water, and allow to air dry at room temperature.

              11.7.6 Place the disc, with deposition side (unpainted side) up, on a planchet and secure with double-side plastic tape. Place the planchet with disc in alpha spectrometry system and count for 1000 minutes.

              Method 114—Test Methods for Measuring Radionuclide Emissions from Stationary Sources
              1. Purpose and Background
              
              
              This method provides the requirements for: (1) Stack monitoring and sample collection methods appropriate for radionuclides; (2) radiochemical methods which are used in determining the amounts of radionuclides collected by the stack sampling and; (3) quality assurance methods which are conducted in conjunction with these measurements. These methods are appropriate for emissions for stationary sources. A list of references is provided.

              Many different types of facilities release radionuclides into air. These radionuclides differ in the chemical and physical forms, half-lives and type of radiation emitted. The appropriate combination of sample extraction, collection and analysis for an individual radionuclide is dependent upon many interrelated factors including the mixture of other radionuclides present. Because of this wide range of conditions, no single method for monitoring or sample collection and analysis of a radionuclide is applicable to all types of facilities. Therefore, a series of methods based on “principles of measurement” are described for monitoring and sample collection and analysis which are applicable to the measurement of radionuclides found in effluent streams at stationary sources. This approach provides the user with the flexibility to choose the most appropriate combination of monitoring and sample collection and analysis methods which are applicable to the effluent stream to be measured.
              
              2. Stack Monitoring and Sample Collection Methods
              
              

              Monitoring and sample collection methods are described based on “principles of monitoring and sample collection” which are applicable to the measurement of radionuclides from effluent streams at stationary sources. Radionuclides of most elements will be in the particulate form in these effluent streams and can be readily collected using a suitable filter media. Radionuclides of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, the noble gases and in some circumstances iodine will be in the gaseous form. Radionuclides of these elements will require either the use of an in-line or off-line monitor to directly measure the radionuclides, or suitable sorbers, condensers or bubblers to collect the radionuclides.
              2.1 Radionuclides as Particulates. The extracted effluent stream is passed through a filter media to remove the particulates. The filter must have a high efficiency for removal of sub-micron particles. The guidance in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 (section 6.6.2 Filter media) shall be followed in using filter media to collect particulates (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18 of this part).
              2.2 Radionuclides as Gases.
              2.2.1 The Radionuclide Tritium (H-3). Tritium in the form of water vapor is collected from the extracted effluent sample by sorption, condensation or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectors may include silica gel, molecular sieves, and ethylene glycol or water bubblers.
              Tritium in the gaseous form may be measured directly in the sample stream using Method B-1, collected as a gas sample or may be oxidized using a metal catalyst to tritiated water and collected as described above.
              2.2.2 Radionuclides of Iodine. Iodine is collected from an extracted sample by sorption or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectors may include charcoal, impregnated charcoal, metal zeolite and caustic solutions.
              2.2.3 Radionuclides of Argon, Krypton and Xenon. Radionuclides of these elements are either measured directly by an in-line or off-line monitor, or are collected from the extracted sample by low temperature sorption techniques, Appropriate sorbers may include charcoal or metal zeolite.
              2.2.4 Radionuclides of Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen and Radon. Radionuclides of these elements are measured directly using an in-line or off-line monitor. Radionuclides of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide may be collected by dissolution in caustic solutions.
              2.3 Definition of Terms
              
                In-line monitor means a continuous measurement system in which the detector is placed directly in or adjacent to the effluent stream. This may involve either gross radioactivity measurements or specific radionuclide measurements. Gross measurements shall be made in conformance with the conditions specified in Methods A-4, B-2 and G-4.
              
                Off-line monitor means a measurement system in which the detector is used to continuously measure an extracted sample of the effluent stream. This may involve either gross radioactivity measurements or specific radionuclide measurements. Gross measurements shall be made in conformance with the conditions specified in Methods A-4, B-2 and G-4.
              
                Sample collection means a procedure in which the radionuclides are removed from an extracted sample of the effluent using a collection media. These collection media include filters, absorbers, bubblers and condensers. The collected sample is analyzed using the methods described in Section 3.
              
              3. Radionuclide Analysis Methods
              
              
              A series of methods based on “principles of measurement” are described which are applicable to the analysis of radionuclides collected from airborne effluent streams at stationary sources. These methods are applicable only under the conditions stated and within the limitations described. Some methods specify that only a single radionuclide be present in the sample or the chemically separated sample. This condition should be interpreted to mean that no other radionuclides are present in quantities which would interfere with the measurement.
              Also identified (Table 1) are methods for a selected list of radionuclides. The listed radionuclides are those which are most commonly used and which have the greatest potential for causing dose to members of the public. Use of methods based on principles of measurement other than those described in this section must be approved in advance of use by the Administrator. For radionuclides not listed in Table 1, any of the described methods may be used provided the user can demonstrate that the applicability conditions of the method have been met.
              The type of method applicable to the analysis of a radionuclide is dependent upon the type of radiation emitted, i.e., alpha, beta or gamma. Therefore, the methods described below are grouped according to principles of measurements for the analysis of alpha, beta and gamma emitting radionuclides.
              3.1 Methods for Alpha Emitting Radionuclides
              3.1.1 Method A-1, Radiochemistry-Alpha Spectrometry.
              
                Principle: The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix using radiochemical techniques. The procedure may involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet in a very thin film by electrodeposition or by coprecipitation on a very small amount of carrier, such as lanthanum fluoride. The deposited element is then counted with an alpha spectrometer. The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by the number of alpha counts in the appropriate energy region. A correction for chemical yield and counting efficiency is made using a standardized radioactive nuclide (tracer) of the same element. If a radioactive tracer is not available for the element of interest, a predetermined chemical yield factor may be used.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable for determining the activity of any alpha-emitting radionuclide, regardless of what other radionuclides are present in the sample provided the chemical separation step produces a very thin sample and removes all other radionuclides which could interfere in the spectral region of interest. APHA-605(2), ASTM-D-3972(13).
              3.1.2 Method A-2, Radiochemistry-Alpha Counting.
              
                Principle: The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix using radiochemistry. The procedure may involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet in a thin film and counted with an alpha counter. A correction for chemical yield (if necessary) is made. The alpha count rate measures the total activity of all emitting radionuclides of the separated element.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable for the measurement of any alpha-emitting radionuclide, provided no other alpha emitting radionuclide is present in the separated sample. It may also be applicable for determining compliance, when other radionuclides of the separated element are present, provided that the calculated emission rate is assigned to the radionuclide which could be present in the sample that has the highest dose conversion factor. IDO-12096(18).
              3.1.3 Method A-3, Direct Alpha Spectrometry.
              
                Principle: The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted directly on an alpha spectrometer. The sample must be thin enough and collected on the surface of the filter so that any absorption of alpha particle energy in the sample or the filter, which would degrade the spectrum, is minimal.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable to simple mixtures of alpha emitting radionuclides and only when the amount of particulates collected on the filter paper are relatively small and the alpha spectra is adequately resolved. Resolutions should be 50 keV (FWHM) or better, ASTM-D-3084(16).
              3.1.4 Method A-4, Direct Alpha Counting (Gross alpha determination).
              
                Principle: The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted with an alpha counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-absorption is not significant and the filter must be of such a nature that the particles are retained on the surface.
              
                Applicability: Gross alpha determinations may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only (1) when it is known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide, or the identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the sample are well-known, and (2) measurements using either Method A-1, A-2 or A-5 have shown that this method provides a reasonably accurate measurement of the emission rate. Gross alpha measurements are applicable to unidentified mixtures of radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7. APHA-601(3), ASTM-D-1943(10).
              3.1.5 Method A-5, Chemical Determination of Uranium.
              
                Principle: Uranium may be measured chemically by either colorimetry or fluorometry. In both procedures, the sample is dissolved, the uranium is oxidized to the hexavalent form and extracted into a suitable solvent. Impurities are removed from the solvent layer. For colorimetry, dibenzoylmethane is added, and the uranium is measured by the absorbance in a colorimeter. For fluorometry, a portion of the solution is fused with a sodium fluoride-lithium fluoride flux and the uranium is determined by the ultraviolet activated fluorescence of the fused disk in a fluorometer.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurements of emission rates of uranium when the isotopic ratio of the uranium radionuclides is well known. ASTM-E-318(15), ASTM-D-2907(14).
              3.1.6 Method A-6, Radon-222—Continuous Gas Monitor.
              
                Principle: Radon-222 is measured directly in a continuously extracted sample stream by passing the air stream through a calibrated scintillation cell. Prior to the scintillation cell, the air stream is treated to remove particulates and excess moisture. The alpha particles from radon-222 and its decay products strike a zinc sulfide coating on the inside of the scintillation cell producing light pulses. The light pulses are detected by a photomultiplier tube which generates electrical pulses. These pulses are processed by the system electronics and the read out is in pCi/l of radon-222.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurement of radon-222 in effluent streams which do not contain significant quantities of radon-220. Users of this method should calibrate the monitor in a radon calibration chamber at least twice per year. The background of the monitor should also be checked periodically by operating the instrument in a low radon environment. EPA 520/1-89-009(24).
              3.1.7 Method A-7, Radon-222-Alpha Track Detectors
              
                Principle: Radon-222 is measured directly in the effluent stream using alpha track detectors (ATD). The alpha particles emitted by radon-222 and its decay products strike a small plastic strip and produce submicron damage tracks. The plastic strip is placed in a caustic solution that accentuates the damage tracks which are counted using a microscope or automatic counting system. The number of tracks per unit area is correlated to the radon concentration in air using a conversion factor derived from data generated in a radon calibration facility.
              
                Applicability: Prior approval from EPA is required for use of this method. This method is only applicable to effluent streams which do not contain significant quantities of radon-220, unless special detectors are used to discriminate against radon-220. This method may be used only when ATDs have been demonstrated to produce data comparable to data obtained with Method A-6. Such data should be submitted to EPA when requesting approval for the use of this method. EPA 520/1-89-009(24).
              3.2 Methods for Gaseous Beta Emitting Radionuclides.
              3.2.1 Method B-1, Direct Counting in Flow-Through Ionization Chambers.
              
                Principle: An ionization chamber containing a specific volume of gas which flows at a given flow rate through the chamber is used. The sample (effluent stream sample) acts as the counting gas for the chamber. The activity of the radionuclide is determined from the current measured in the ionization chamber.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable for measuring the activity of a gaseous beta-emitting radionuclide in an effluent stream that is suitable as a counting gas, when no other beta-emitting nuclides are present. DOE/EP-0096(17), NCRP-58(23).
              3.2.2 Method B-2, Direct Counting With In-line or Off-line Beta Detectors.
              
                Principle: The beta detector is placed directly in the effluent stream (in-line) or an extracted sample of the effluent stream is passed through a chamber containing a beta detector (off-line). The activities of the radionuclides present in the effluent stream are determined from the beta count rate, and a knowledge of the radionuclides present and the relationship of the gross beta count rate and the specific radionuclide concentration.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable only to radionuclides with maximum beta particle energies greater then 0.2 MeV. This method may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only when it is known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide or the identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the effluent stream are well known. Specific radionuclide analysis of periodic grab samples may be used to identify the types and quantities of radionuclides present and to establish the relationship between specific radionuclide analyses and gross beta count rates.
              This method is applicable to unidentified mixtures of gaseous radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7.
              3.3 Methods for Non-Gaseous Beta Emitting Radionuclides.
              3.3.1 Method B-3, Radiochemistry-Beta Counting.
              
                Principle: The element of interest is separated from other elements, and from the sample matrix by radiochemistry. This may involve precipitation, distillation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is deposited on a planchet, and counted with a beta counter. Corrections for chemical yield, and decay (if necessary) are made. The beta count rate determines the total activity of all radionuclides of the separated element. This method may also involve the radiochemical separation and counting of a daughter element, after a suitable period of ingrowth, in which case it is specific for the parent nuclide.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable for measuring the activity of any beta-emitting radionuclide, with a maximum energy greater than 0.2 MeV, provided no other radionuclide is present in the separated sample. APHA-608(5).
              3.3.2 Method B-4, Direct Beta Counting (Gross beta determination).
              
                Principle: The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counted with a beta counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-absorption corrections can be made.
              
                Applicability: Gross beta measurements are applicable only to radionuclides with maximum beta particle energies greater than 0.2 MeV. Gross beta measurements may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only (1) when it is known that the sample contains only a single radionuclide, and (2) measurements made using Method B-3 show reasonable agreement with the gross beta measurement. Gross beta measurements are applicable to mixtures of radionuclides only for the purposes and under the conditions described in section 3.7. APHA-602(4), ASTM-D-1890(11).
              3.3.3 Method B-5, Liquid Scintillation Spectrometry.
              
                Principle: An aliquot of a collected sample or the result of some other chemical separation or processing technique is added to a liquid scintillation “cocktail” which is viewed by photomultiplier tubes in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The spectrometer is adjusted to establish a channel or “window” for the pulse energy appropriate to the nuclide of interest. The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by the counting rate in the appropriate energy channel. Corrections are made for chemical yield where separations are made.
              
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable to any beta-emitting nuclide when no other radionuclide is present in the sample or the separated sample provided that it can be incorporated in the scintillation cocktail. This method is also applicable for samples which contain more than one radionuclide but only when the energies of the beta particles are sufficiently separated so that they can be resolved by the spectrometer. This method is most applicable to the measurement of low-energy beta emitters such as tritium and carbon-14. APHA-609(6), EML-LV-539-17(19).
              3.4 Gamma Emitting Radionuclides
              3.4.1 Method G-1, High Resolution Gamma Spectrometry.
              
                Principle: The sample is counted with a high resolution gamma detector, usually either a Ge(Li) or a high purity Ge detector, connected to a multichannel analyzer or computer. The gamma emitting radionuclides in the sample are measured from the gamma count rates in the energy regions characteristic of the individual radionuclide. Corrections are made for counts contributed by other radionuclides to the spectral regions of the radionuclides of interest. Radiochemical separations may be made prior to counting but are usually not necessary.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurement of any gamma emitting radionuclide with gamma energies greater than 20 keV. It can be applied to complex mixtures of radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulate filters, absorbers, liquids or gases. The method may also be applied to the analysis of gaseous gamma emitting radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing the stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector. ASTM-3649(9), IDO-12096(18).
              3.4.2 Method G-2, Low Resolution Gamma Spectrometry.
              
                Principle: The sample is counted with a low resolution gamma detector, a thallium activated sodium iodide crystal. The detector is coupled to a photomultiplier tube and connected to a multichannel analyzer. The gamma emitting radionuclides in the sample are measured from the gamma count rates in the energy regions characteristic of the individual radionuclides. Corrections are made for counts contributed by other radionuclides to the spectral regions of the radionuclides of interest. Radiochemical separation may be used prior to counting to obtain less complex gamma spectra if needed.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurement of gamma emitting radionuclides with energies greater than 100 keV. It can be applied only to relatively simple mixtures of gamma emitting radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulate filters, absorbers, liquids or gas. The method can be applied to the analysis of gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing the gas stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector. ASTM-D-2459(12), EMSL-LV-0539-17(19).
              3.4.3 Method G-3, Single Channel Gamma Spectrometry.
              
                Principle: The sample is counted with a thallium activated sodium iodide crystal. The detector is coupled to a photomultiplier tube connected to a single channel analyzer. The activity of a gamma emitting radionuclide is determined from the gamma counts in the energy range for which the counter is set.
              
                Applicability: This method is applicable to the measurement of a single gamma emitting radionuclide. It is not applicable to mixtures of radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulate filters, absorbers, liquids or gas. The method can be applied to the analysis of gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing the gas stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector.
              3.4.4 Method G-4, Gross Gamma Counting.
              
                Principle: The sample is counted with a gamma detector usually a thallium activated sodium iodine crystal. The detector is coupled to a photomultiplier tube and gamma rays above a specific threshold energy level are counted.
              
                Applicability: Gross gamma measurements may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclides only when it is known that the sample contains a single radionuclide or the identity and isotopic ratio of the radionuclides in the effluent stream are well known. When gross gamma measurements are used to determine emissions of specific radionuclides periodic measurements using Methods G-1 or G-2 should be made to demonstrate that the gross gamma measurements provide reliable emission data. This method may be applied to analysis of gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by placing the detector directly in or adjacent to the effluent stream or passing an extracted sample of the effluent stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector.
              3.5 Counting Methods. All of the above methods with the exception of Method A-5 involve counting the radiation emitted by the radionuclide. Counting methods applicable to the measurement of alpha, beta and gamma radiations are listed below. The equipment needed and the counting principles involved are described in detail in ASTM-3648(8).
              3.5.1 Alpha Counting:
              • Gas Flow Proportional Counters. The alpha particles cause ionization in the counting gas and the resulting electrical pulses are counted. These counters may be windowless or have very thin windows.
              • Scintillation Counters. The alpha particles transfer energy to a scintillator resulting in a production of light photons which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light photons to electrical pulses which are counted. The counters may involve the use of solid scintillation materials such as zinc sulfide or liquid scintillation solutions.
              • Solid-State Counters. Semiconductor materials, such as silicon surface-barrier p-n junctions, act as solid ionization chambers. The alpha particles interact which the detector producing electron hole pairs. The charged pair is collected by an applied electrical field and the resulting electrical pulses are counted.
              • Alpha Spectrometers. Semiconductor detectors used in conjunction with multichannel analyzers for energy discrimination.
              3.5.2 Beta Counting:
              • Ionization Chambers. These chambers contain the beta-emitting nuclide in gaseous form. The ionization current produced is measured.
              • Geiger-Muller (GM) Counters-or Gas Flow Proportional Counters. The beta particles cause ionization in the counting gas and the resulting electrical pulses are counted. Proportional gas flow counters which are heavily shielded by lead or other metal, and provided with an anti-coincidence shield to reject cosmic rays, are called low background beta counters.
              • Scintillation Counters. The beta particles transfer energy to a scintillator resulting in a production of light photons, which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light photon to electrical pulses which are counted. This may involve the use of anthracene crystals, plastic scintillator, or liquid scintillation solutions with organic phosphors.
              • Liquid Scintillation Spectrometers. Liquid scintillation counters which use two photomultiplier tubes in coincidence to reduce background counts. This counter may also electronically discriminate among pulses of a given range of energy.
              3.5.3 Gamma Counting:
              • Low-Resolution Gamma Spectrometers. The gamma rays interact with thallium activated sodium iodide or cesium iodide crystal resulting in the release of light photons which strike a photomultiplier tube converting the light pulses to electrical pulses proportional to the energy of the gamma ray. Multi-channel analyzers are used to separate and store the pulses according to the energy absorbed in the crystal.
              • High-Resolution gamma Spectrometers. Gamma rays interact with a lithium-drifted (Ge(Li)) or high-purity germanium (HPGe) semiconductor detectors resulting in a production of electron-hole pairs. The charged pair is collected by an applied electrical field. A very stable low noise preamplifier amplifies the pulses of electrical charge resulting from the gamma photon interactions. Multichannel analyzers or computers are used to separate and store the pulses according to the energy absorbed in the crystal.
              • Single Channel Analyzers. Thallium activated sodium iodide crystals used with a single window analyzer. Pulses from the photomultiplier tubes are separated in a single predetermined energy range.
              3.5.4 Calibration of Counters. Counters are calibrated for specific radionuclide measurements using a standard of the radionuclide under either identical or very similar conditions as the sample to be counted. For gamma spectrometers a series of standards covering the energy range of interest may be used to construct a calibration curve relating gamma energy to counting efficiency.
              In those cases where a standard is not available for a radionuclide, counters may be calibrated using a standard with energy characteristics as similar as possible to the radionuclide to be measured. For gross alpha and beta measurements of the unidentified mixtures of radionuclides, alpha counters are calibrated with a natural uranium standard and beta counters with a cesium-137 standard. The standard must contain the same weight and distribution of solids as the samples, and be mounted in an identical manner. If the samples contain variable amounts of solids, calibration curves relating weight of solids present to counting efficiency are prepared. Standards other than those prescribed may be used provided it can be shown that such standards are more applicable to the radionuclide mixture measured.
              3.6 Radiochemical Methods for Selected Radionuclides. Methods for a selected list of radionuclides are listed in Table 1. The radionuclides listed are those which are most commonly used and which have the greatest potential for causing doses to members of the public. For radionuclides not listed in Table 1, methods based on any of the applicable “principles of measurement” described in section 3.1 through 3.4 may be used.
              3.7 Applicability of Gross Alpha and Beta Measurements to Unidentified Mixtures of Radionuclides. Gross alpha and beta measurements may be used as a screening measurement as a part of an emission measurement program to identify the need to do specific radionuclide analyses or to confirm or verify that unexpected radionuclides are not being released in significant quantities.

              Gross alpha (Method A-4) or gross beta (Methods B-2 or B-4) measurements may also be used for the purpose of comparing the measured concentrations in the effluent stream with the limiting “Concentration Levels for Environmental Compliance” in table 2 of appendix E. For unidentified mixtures, the measured concentration value shall be compared with the lowest environmental concentration limit for any radionuclide which is not known to be absent from the effluent stream.

              Each facility required to measure their radionuclide emissions shall conduct a quality assurance program in conjunction with the radionuclide emission measurements. This program shall assure that the emission measurements are representative, and are of known precision and accuracy and shall include administrative controls to assure prompt response when emission measurements indicate unexpectedly large emissions. The program shall consist of a system of policies, organizational responsibilities, written procedures, data quality specifications, audits, corrective actions and reports. This quality assurance program shall include the following program elements:
              4.1 The organizational structure, functional responsibilities, levels of authority and lines of communications for all activities related to the emissions measurement program shall be identified and documented.
              4.2 Administrative controls shall be prescribed to ensure prompt response in the event that emission levels increase due to unplanned operations.
              4.3 The sample collection and analysis procedures used in measuring the emissions shall be described including where applicable:
              4.3.1 Identification of sampling sites and number of sampling points, including the rationale for site selections.
              4.3.2 A description of sampling probes and representativeness of the samples.
              4.3.3 A description of any continuous monitoring system used to measure emissions, including the sensitivity of the system, calibration procedures and frequency of calibration.
              4.3.4 A description of the sample collection systems for each radionuclide measured, including frequency of collection, calibration procedures and frequency of calibration.
              4.3.5 A description of the laboratory analysis procedures used for each radionuclide measured, including frequency of analysis, calibration procedures and frequency of calibration.
              4.3.6 A description of the sample flow rate measurement systems or procedures, including calibration procedures and frequency of calibration.
              4.3.7 A description of the effluent flow rate measurement procedures, including frequency of measurements, calibration procedures and frequency of calibration.
              4.4 The objectives of the quality assurance program shall be documented and shall state the required precision, accuracy and completeness of the emission measurement data including a description of the procedures used to assess these parameters. Accuracy is the degree of agreement of a measurement with a true or known value. Precision is a measure of the agreement among individual measurements of the same parameters under similar conditions. Completeness is a measure of the amount of valid data obtained compared to the amount expected under normal conditions.
              4.5 A quality control program shall be established to evaluate and track the quality of the emissions measurement data against preset criteria. The program should include where applicable a system of replicates, spiked samples, split samples, blanks and control charts. The number and frequency of such quality control checks shall be identified.

              4.6 A sample tracking system shall be established to provide for positive identification of samples and data through all phases of the sample collection, analysis and reporting system. Sample handling and preservation procedures shall be established to maintain the integrity of samples during collection, storage and analysis.
              4.7 Regular maintenance, calibration and field checks shall be performed for each sampling system in use by satisfying the requirements found in Table 2: Maintenance, Calibration and Field Check Requirements.

              4.9 A corrective action program shall be established including criteria for when corrective action is needed, what corrective actions will be taken and who is responsible for taking the corrective action.
              4.10 Periodic reports to responsible management shall be prepared on the performance of the emissions measurements program. These reports should include assessment of the quality of the data, results of audits and description of corrective actions.

              4.11 The quality assurance program should be documented in a quality assurance project plan that should address each of the above requirements.

              Method 115—Monitoring for Radon-222 Emissions

              This appendix describes the monitoring methods which must be used in determining the radon-222 emissions from underground uranium mines, uranium mill tailings piles, phosphogypsum stacks, and other piles of waste material emitting radon.
              
              1. Radon-222 Emissions from Underground Uranium Mine Vents
              
              
              1.1 Sampling Frequency and Calculation of Emissions. Radon-222 emissions from underground uranium mine vents shall be determined using one of the following methods:
              1.1.1 Continuous Measurement. These measurements shall be made and the emissions calculated as follows:
              (a) The radon-222 concentration shall be continuously measured at each mine vent whenever the mine ventilation system is operational.
              (b) Each mine vent exhaust flow rate shall be measured at least 4 times per year.

              (c) A weekly radon-222 emission rate for the mine shall be calculated and recorded weekly as follows:
              
              Aw= C1Q1T1 + C2Q2T2 + . . . CiQiTi
              
              
              Where:
              Aw = Total radon-222 emitted from the mine during week (Ci)
              Ci = Average radon-222 concentration in mine vent i(Ci/m3)
              Qi = Volumetric flow rate from mine vent i(m3/hr)
              Ti = Hours of mine ventilation system operation during week for mine vent i(hr)
              
              (d) The annual radon-222 emission rate is the sum of the weekly emission rates during a calendar year.
              1.1.2 Periodic Measurement. This method is applicable only to mines that continuously operate their ventilation system except for extended shutdowns. Mines which start up and shut down their ventilation system frequently must use the continuous measurement method describe in Section 1.1.1 above. Emission rates determined using periodic measurements shall be measured and calculated as follows:
              (a) The radon-222 shall be continuously measured at each mine vent for at least one week every three months.
              (b) Each mine vent exhaust flow rate shall be measured at least once during each of the radon-222 measurement periods.
              (c) A weekly radon-222 emission rate shall be calculated for each weekly period according to the method described in Section 1.1.1. In this calculation T = 168 hr.
              (d) The annual radon-222 emission rate from the mine should be calculated as follows:
              
                EC15NO91.090
              
              Where:
              Ay = Annual radon-222 emission rate from the mine(Ci)
              Awi = Weekly radon-222 emission rate during the measurement period i (Ci)
              n = Number of weekly measurement periods per year
              Ws = Number of weeks during the year that the mine ventilation system is shut down in excess of 7 consecutive days, i.e. the sum of the number of weeks each shut down exceeds 7 days
              
              1.2 Test Methods and Procedures
              Each underground mine required to test its emissions, unless an equivalent or alternative method has been approved by the Administrator, shall use the following test methods:

              1.2.1 Test Method 1 of appendix A to part 60 shall be used to determine velocity traverses. The sampling point in the duct shall be either the centroid of the cross section or the point of average velocity.
              1.2.2 Test Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates.
              1.2.3 Test Methods A-6 or A-7 of appendix B, Method 114 to part 61 shall be used for the analysis of radon-222. Use of Method A-7 requires prior approval of EPA based on conditions described in appendix B.

              1.2.4 A quality assurance program shall be conducted in conformance with the programs described for Continuous Radon Monitors and Alpha Track Detectors in EPA 520/1-89-009. (2)
              
              2. Radon-222 Emissions from Uranium Mill Tailings Piles
              
              
              2.1 Measurement and Calculation of Radon Flux from Uranium Mill Tailings Piles.
              2.1.1 Frequency of Flux Measurement. A single set of radon flux measurements may be made, or if the owner or operator chooses, more frequent measurements may be made over a one year period. These measurements may involve quarterly, monthly or weekly intervals. All radon measurements shall be made as described in paragraphs 2.1.2 through 2.1.6 except that for measurements made over a one year period, the requirement of paragraph 2.1.4(c) shall not apply. The mean radon flux from the pile shall be the arithmetic mean of the mean radon flux for each measurement period. The weather conditions, moisture content of the tailings and area of the pile covered by water existing at the time of the measurement shall be chosen so as to provide measurements representative of the long term radon flux from the pile and shall be subject to EPA review and approval.

              2.1.2 Distribution of Flux Measurements. The distribution and number of radon flux measurements required on a pile will depend on clearly defined areas of the pile (called regions) that can have significantly different radon fluxes due to surface conditions. The mean radon flux shall be determined for each individual region of the pile. Regions that shall be considered for operating mill tailings piles are:
              
              (a) Water covered areas,
              (b) Water saturated areas (beaches),
              (c) Dry top surface areas, and
              (d) Sides, except where earthen material is used in dam construction.
              
              For mill tailings after disposal the pile shall be considered to consist of only one region.

              2.1.3 Number of Flux Measurements. Radon flux measurements shall be made within each region on the pile, except for those areas covered with water. Measurements shall be made at regularly spaced locations across the surface of the region, realizing that surface roughness will prohibit measurements in some areas of a region. The minimum number of flux measurements considered necessary to determine a representative mean radon flux value for each type of region on an operating pile is:
              
              (a) Water covered area—no measurements required as radon flux is assumed to be zero,
              (b) Water saturated beaches—100 radon flux measurements,
              (c) Loose and dry top surface—100 radon flux measurements,
              (d) Sides—100 radon flux measurements, except where earthern material is used in dam construction.
              
              For a mill tailings pile after disposal which consists of only one region a minimum of 100 measurements are required.

              2.1.4 Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. The following restrictions are placed on making radon flux measurements:
              
              (a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a rainfall.
              (b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurements period, the measurement is invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has washed away or if the collector is surrounded by water.
              (c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature is below 35 °F or if the ground is frozen.
              
              2.1.5 Areas of Pile Regions. The approximate area of each region of the pile shall be determined in units of square meters.
              2.1.6 Radon Flux Measurement. Measuring radon flux involves the adsorption of radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector. The radon collector is placed on the surface of the pile area to be measured and allowed to collect radon for a time period of 24 hours. The radon collected on the charcoal is measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. The detailed measurement procedure provided in appendix A of EPA 520/5-85-0029(1) shall be used to measure the radon flux on uranium mill tailings, except the surface of the tailings shall not be penetrated by the lip of the radon collector as directed in the procedure, rather the collector shall be carefully positioned on a flat surface with soil or tailings used to seal the edge.

              2.1.7 Calculations. The mean radon flux for each region of the pile and for the total pile shall be calculated and reported as follows:
              
              (a) The individual radon flux calculations shall be made as provided in appendix A EPA 86 (1). The mean radon flux for each region of the pile shall be calculated by summing all individual flux measurements for the region and dividing by the total number of flux measurements for the region.
              (b) The mean radon flux for the total uranium mill tailings pile shall be calculated as follows.
              
                
                EC15NO91.091
              
              Where:
              
              Js = Mean flux for the total pile (pCi/m2-s)
              Ji = Mean flux measured in region i (pCi/m2-s)
              Ai = Area of region i (m2)
              At = Total area of the pile (m2)
              
              2.1.8 Reporting. The results of individual flux measurements, the approximate locations on the pile, and the mean radon flux for each region and the mean radon flux for the total stack shall be included in the emission test report. Any condition or unusual event that occurred during the measurements that could significantly affect the results should be reported.
              3.0 Radon-222 Emissions from Phosphogypsum Stacks.
              3.1 Measurement and Calculation of the Mean Radon Flux. Radon flux measurements shall be made on phosphogypsum stacks as described below:
              3.1.1 Frequency of Measurements. A single set of radon flux measurements may be made after the phosphogypsum stack becomes inactive, or if the owner or operator chooses, more frequent measurements may be made over a one year period. These measurements may involve quarterly, monthly or weekly intervals. All radon measurements shall be made as described in paragraphs 3.1.2 through 3.1.6 except that for measurements made over a one year period, the requirement of paragraph 3.1.4(c) shall not apply. For measurements made over a one year period, the radon flux shall be the arithmetic mean of the mean radon flux for each measurement period.

              3.1.2 Distribution and Number of Flux Measurements. The distribution and number of radon flux measurements required on a stack will depend on clearly defined areas of the stack (called regions) that can have significantly different radon fluxes due to surface conditions. The mean radon flux shall be determined for each individual region of the stack. Regions that shall be considered are:
              
              (a) Water covered areas,
              (b) Water saturated areas (beaches),
              (c) Loose and dry top surface areas,
              (d) Hard-packed roadways, and
              (e) Sides.
              

              3.1.3 Number of Flux Measurements. Radon flux measurements shall be made within each region on the phosphogypsum stack, except for those areas covered with water. Measurements shall be made at regularly spaced locations across the surface of the region, realizing that surface roughness will prohibit measurements in some areas of a region. The minimum number of flux measurements considered necessary to determine a representative mean radon flux value for each type of region is:
              
              (a) Water covered area—no measurements required as radon flux is assumed to be zero,
              (b) Water saturated beaches—50 radon flux measurements,
              (c) Loose and dry top surface—100 radon flux measurements,
              (d) Hard-packed roadways—50 radon flux measurements, and
              (e) Sides—100 radon flux measurements.
              
              A minimum of 300 measurements are required. A stack that has no water cover can be considered to consist of two regions, top and sides, and will require a minimum of only 200 measurements.

              3.1.4 Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. The following restrictions are placed on making radon flux measurements:
              
              (a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a rainfall.
              (b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurement period, the measurement is invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has washed away or if the collector is surrounded by water.
              (c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature is below 35 °F or if the ground is frozen.
              
              3.1.5 Areas of Stack Regions. The approximate area of each region of the stack shall be determined in units of square meters.
              3.1.6 Radon Flux Measurements. Measuring radon flux involves the adsorption of radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector. The radon collector is placed on the surface of the stack area to be measured and allowed to collect radon for a time period of 24 hours. The radon collected on the charcoal is measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. The detailed measurement procedure provided in appendix A of EPA 520/5-85-0029(1) shall be used to measure the radon flux on phosphogypsum stacks, except the surface of the phosphogypsum shall not be penetrated by the lip of the radon collector as directed in the procedure, rather the collector shall be carefully positioned on a flat surface with soil or phosphogypsum used to seal the edge.

              3.1.7 Calculations. The mean radon flux for each region of the phosphogypsum stack and for the total stack shall be calculated and reported as follows:
              
              (a) The individual radon flux calculations shall be made as provided in appendix A EPA 86 (1). The mean radon flux for each region of the stack shall be calculated by summing all individual flux measurements for the region and dividing by the total number of flux measurements for the region.
              (b) The mean radon flux for the total phosphogypsum stack shall be calculated as follows.
              
                
                EC15NO91.092
              
              Where:
              Js = Mean flux for the total stack (pCi/m2-s)
              Ji = Mean flux measured in region i (pCi/m2-s)
              Ai = Area of region i (m2)
              At = Total area of the stack
              
              3.1.8 Reporting. The results of individual flux measurements, the approximate locations on the stack, and the mean radon flux for each region and the mean radon flux for the total stack shall be included in the emission test report. Any condition or unusual event that occurred during the measurements that could significantly affect the results should be reported.
              4.0 Quality Assurance Procedures for Measuring Rn-222 Flux
              A. Sampling Procedures

              Records of field activities and laboratory measurements shall be maintained. The following information shall be recorded for each charcoal canister measurement:
              
              (a) Site
              (b) Name of pile
              (c) Sample location
              (d) Sample ID number
              (e) Date and time on
              (f) Date and time off
              (g) Observations of meteorological conditions and comments
              
              Records shall include all applicable information associated with determining the sample measurement, calculations, observations, and comments.
              B. Sample Custody
              Custodial control of all charcoal samples exposed in the field shall be maintained in accordance with EPA chain-of-custody field procedures. A control record shall document all custody changes that occur between the field and laboratory personnel.
              C. Calibration Procedures and Frequency
              The radioactivity of two standard charcoal sources, each containing a carefully determined quantity of radium-226 uniformly distributed through 180g of activated charcoal, shall be measured. An efficiency factor is computed by dividing the average measured radioactivity of the two standard charcoal sources, minus the background, in cpm by the known radioactivity of the charcoal sources in dpm. The same two standard charcoal sources shall be counted at the beginning and at the end of each day's counting as a check of the radioactivity counting equipment. A background count using unexposed charcoal should also be made at the beginning and at the end of each counting day to check for inadvertent contamination of the detector or other changes affecting the background. The unexposed charcoal comprising the blank is changed with each new batch of charcoal used.
              D. Internal Quality Control Checks and Frequency
              The charcoal from every tenth exposed canister shall be recounted. Five percent of the samples analyzed shall be either blanks (charcoal having no radioactivity added) or samples spiked with known quantities of radium-226.
              E. Data Precision, Accuracy, and Completeness
              The precision, accuracy, and completeness of measurements and analyses shall be within the following limits for samples measuring greater than 1.0 pCi/m2−s.
              (a) Precision: 10%
              (b) Accuracy: ±10%
              (c) Completeness: at least 85% of the measurements must yield useable results.

              Appendix C to Part 61—Quality Assurance Procedures
              Procedure 1—Determination of Adequate Chromatographic Peak Resolution
              In this method of dealing with resolution, the extent to which one chromatographic peak overlaps another is determined.

              For convenience, consider the range of the elution curve of each compound as running from −2σ to + 2σ. This range is used in other resolution criteria, and it contains 95.45 percent of the area of a normal curve. If two peaks are separated by a known distance, b, one can determine the fraction of the area of one curve that lies within the range of the other. The extent to which the elution curve of a contaminant compound overlaps the curve of a compound that is under analysis is found by integrating the contaminant curve over the limits b−2σs to b + 2σs, where σs is the standard deviation of the sample curve.
              This calculation can be simplified in several ways. Overlap can be determined for curves of unit area; then actual areas can be introduced. Desired integration can be resolved into two integrals of the normal distribution function for which there are convenient calculation programs and tables.

              In judging the suitability of alternate GC columns or the effects of altering chromatographic conditions, one can employ the area overlap as the resolution parameter with a specific maximum permissible value.
              

              The use of Gaussian functions to describe chromatographic elution curves is widespread. However, some elution curves are highly asymmetric. In cases where the sample peak is followed by a contaminant that has a leading edge that rises sharply but the curve then tails off, it may be possible to define an effective width for tc as “twice the distance from the leading edge to a perpendicular line through the maxim of the contaminant curve, measured along a perpendicular bisection of that line.”
              Procedure 2—Procedure for Field Auditing GC Analysis
              Responsibilities of audit supervisor and analyst at the source sampling site include the following:
              A. The audit supervisor verifies that audit cylinders are stored in a safe location both before and after the audit to prevent vandalism.
              B. At the beginning and conclusion of the audit, the analyst records each cylinder number and pressure. An audit cylinder is never analyzed when the pressure drops below 200 psi.
              C. During the audit, the analyst performs a minimum of two consecutive analyses of each audit cylinder gas. The audit must be conducted to coincide with the analysis of source test samples, normally immediately after GC calibration and prior to sample analyses.
              D. At the end of audit analyses, the audit supervisor requests the calculated concentrations from the analyst and compares the results with the actual audit concentrations. If each measured concentration agrees with the respective actual concentration within ±10 percent, he directs the analyst to begin analyzing source samples. Audit supervisor judgment and/or supervisory policy determine action when agreement is not within ±10 percent. When a consistent bias in excess of 10 percent is found, it may be possible to proceed with the sample analysis, with a corrective factor to be applied to the results at a later time. However, every attempt should be made to locate the cause of the discrepancy, as it may be misleading. The audit supervisor records each cylinder number, cylinder pressure (at the end of the audit), and all calculated concentrations. The individual being audited must not under any circumstance be told actual audit concentrations until calculated concentrations have been submitted to the audit supervisor.

              Appendix D to Part 61—Methods for Estimating Radionuclide Emissions
              1. Purpose and Background

              Facility owners or operators may estimate radionuclide emissions to the atmosphere for dose calculations instead of measuring emissions. Particulate emissions from mill tailings piles should be estimated using the procedures listed in reference re #2. All other emissions may be estimated by using the “Procedures” listed below, or using the method described in reference #1.
              2. Procedure
              To estimate emissions to the atmosphere:
              (a) Determine the amount (in curies) used at facilities for the period under consideration. Radioactive materials in sealed packages that remain unopened, and have not leaked during the assessment period should not be included in the calculation.
              (b) Multiply the amount used by the following factors which depend on the physical state of the radionuclide. They are:
              (i) 1 for gases;
              (ii) 10−3 for liquids or particulate solids; and
              (iii) 10−6 for solids.
              If any nuclide is heated to a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or more, boils at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or less, or is intentionally dispersed into the environment, it must be considered to be a gas.
              (c) If a control device is installed between the place of use and the point of release, multiply emissions from (b) by an adjustment factor. These are presented in Table 1.

              Appendix E to Part 61—Compliance Procedures Methods for Determining Compliance With Subpart I
              1. Purpose and Background
              This Appendix provides simplified procedures to reduce the burden on Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees, and non-Department of Energy Federal facilities in determining compliance with 40 CFR part 61, subpart I. The procedures consist of a series of increasingly more stringent steps, depending on the facility's potential to exceed the standard.

              First, a facility can be found in compliance if the quantity of radioactive material possessed during the year is less than that listed in a table of annual possession quantities. A facility will also be in compliance if the average annual radionuclide emission concentration is less than that listed in a table of air concentration levels. If the facility is not in compliance by these tables, it can establish compliance by estimating a dose using screening procedure developed by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements with a radiological source term derived using EPA approved emission factors. These procedures are described in a “Guide for Determining Compliance with the Clean Air Act Standards for Radionuclide Emissions From NRC-Licensed and Non-DOE Federal Facilities.”
              A user-friendly computer program called COMPLY has been developed to reduce the burden on the regulated community. The Agency has also prepared a “User's Guide for the COMPLY Code” to assist the regulated community in using the code, and in handling more complex situations such as multiple release points. The basis for these compliance procedures are provided in “Background Information Document: Procedures Approved for Demonstrating Compliance with 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart I”. The compliance model is the highest level in the COMPLY computer code and provides for the most realistic assessment of dose by allowing the use of site-specific information.
              2. Table of Annual Possession Quantity
              (a) Table 1 may be used for determining if facilities are in compliance with the standard. The possession table can only be used if the following conditions are met:
              (i) No person lives within 10 meters of any release point; and
              (ii) No milk, meat, or vegetables are produced within 100 meters of any release point.
              (b) Procedures described in Reference (1) shall be used to determine compliance or exemption from reporting by use of Table 2.

                * Radionuclides boiling at 100 °C or less, or exposed to a temperature of 100 °C, must be considered a gas. Capsules containing radionuclides in liquid or powder form can be considered to be solids.
                ** Mo-99 contained in a generator to produce Technetium-99 can be assumed to be a solid.
              
              3. Table of Concentration Levels
              (a) Table 2 may be used for determining if facilities are in compliance with the standard.
              1. The concentration table as applied to emission estimates can only be used if all releases are from point sources and concentrations have been measured at the stack or vent using EPA-approved methods, and the distance between each stack or vent and the nearest resident is greater than 3 times the diameter of the stack or vent. Procedures provided in Ref. (1) shall be used to determine compliance or exemption from reporting by use of Table 2.
              2. The concentration table may be used to determine compliance with the standard based on environmental measurements provided these measurements are made in conformance with the requirements of § 61.107(b)(5).
              4. NCRP Screening Model
              The procedures described in Reference (4) may be used to determine doses to members of the general public from emissions of radionuclides to the atmosphere. Both the total dose from all radionuclides emitted, and the dose caused by radioactive iodine must be considered in accordance with the procedures in Ref. (1).
              5. The COMPLY Computer Code
              The COMPLY computer code may be used to determine compliance with subpart I. The compliance model in the COMPLY computer code may be used to determine the dose to members of the general public from emissions of radionuclides to the atmosphere. The EPA may add radionuclides to all or any part of COMPLY to cover radionuclides that may be used by the regulated community.

            Subpart A—General Provisions
            
              § 62.01
              Definitions.
              As used in this part, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Clean Air Act and in part 60 of this chapter.
            
            
              § 62.02
              Introduction.
              (a) This part sets forth the Administrator's approval and disapproval of State plans for the control of pollutants and facilities under section 111(d), and section 129 as applicable, of the Act, and the Administrator's promulgation of such plans or portions of plans thereof. Approval of a plan or any portion of a plan is based on a determination by the Administrator that it meets the requirements of section 111(d), and section 129 as applicable, of the Act and provisions of part 60 of this chapter.
              (b)(1) If a State does not submit a complete, approvable plan, the Administrator may then promulgate a substitute plan or part of a plan. The promulgated provision, plus the approved parts of the State plan, constitute the applicable plan for purposes of the act.
              (2) The part 60 subpart A of this chapter general provisions and appendices to part 60 apply to part 62, except as follows: 40 CFR 60.7(a)(1), 60.7(a)(3), and 60.8(a) and where special provisions set forth under the applicable subpart of this part shall apply instead of any conflicting provisions.

              (c) The Administrator will promulgate substitute provisions for the disapproved regulatory provisions only. If a nonregulatory provision is disapproved, however, it will be noted in this part and a detailed explanation will be sent to the State.
              
              (d) All approved regulatory provisions of each plan are incorporated by reference in this part. Section 62.12 provides information on availability of applicable plans. The Administrator and State and local agencies shall enforce (1) regulatory provisions of a plan approved or promulgated by the Administrator, and (2) all permit conditions or denials issued in carrying out the approved or promulgated regulations for the review of designated facilities.
              (e) Each State's plan is dealt with in a separate subpart, with separate headings for different pollutants and facilities. The plans shall include an introductory section identifying the plan by name and the date of its submittal. Additional sections are included as necessary to specifically identify disapproved provisions, to set forth reasons for disapproval, and to set forth provisions of the plan promulgated by the Administrator. Except as otherwise specified, all supplemental information submitted to the Administrator with respect to any plan has been submitted by the Governor of the State.
              (f) Revisions to applicable plans will be included in this part when approved or promulgated by the Administrator.
              (g) Substitute plans promulgated by the Administrator for States that do not have approved plans are contained in separate subparts that appear after the subparts for States. These Federal plans include sections identifying the applicability of the plan, emission limits, compliance schedules, recordkeeping and reporting, performance testing, and monitoring requirements.

              § 62.03
              Extensions.
              The Administrator may, whenever he determines necessary, extend the period for submission of any plan or plan revision or portion thereof.
            
            
              § 62.04
              Approval status.
              The approval status of each State's plan or portions thereof, are set forth in each subpart. All plans are approved unless specifically disapproved in the appropriate subpart.
            
            
              § 62.05
              Legal authority.
              (a) The Administrator's determination of the absence or inadequacy of legal authority required to be included in the plan is set forth in each subpart. This includes the legal authority of local agencies and State governmental agencies other than an air pollution control agency if such other agencies are assigned responsibility for carrying out a plan or portion thereof.
              (b) No legal authority as such is promulgated by the Administrator. Where required regulatory provisions are not included in the plan by the State because of inadequate authority, substitute provisions are promulgated by the Administrator.
            
            
              § 62.06
              Negative declarations.
              A State may submit to the Administrator a letter certifying that no designated facilities exist in the State if such is the case. The negative declaration will be in lieu of a plan.
            
            
              § 62.07
              Emission standards, compliance schedules.
              (a) In each subpart, emission standards and compliance schedules which have been disapproved by the Administrator are identified, and those promulgated by the Administrator are set forth.
              (b) The Administrator's approval or promulgation of any compliance schedule shall not affect the responsibility of the owner or operator to comply with any applicable emission limitation on or after the date for final compliance specified in the applicable schedule.
            
            
              § 62.08
              Emission inventories and source surveillance.
              (a) Each subpart identifies the plan provisions for source surveillance which are disapproved, and sets forth the Administrator's promulgation of necessary provisions for requiring designated sources to maintain records, make reports, and submit information.
              (b) The Administrator will not promulgate provisions for disapproved State or local agency procedures for testing, inspection, investigation, or detection. However, detailed critiques of such portions will be provided to the State.
            
            
              
              § 62.09
              Revision of plans by Administrator.
              After notice and opportunity for public hearing in each affected State, the Administrator may revise any provision of an applicable plan if:
              (a) The provision was promulgated by the Administrator and
              (b) The plan, as revised, will be consistent with the Act and with the requirements of part 60, subpart B of this chapter.
            
            
              § 62.10

                The Illinois Plan for implementing the Federal Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Emission Guidelines to control air emissions from existing landfills in the State was submitted on July 21, 1998. The Illinois rules for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills are primarily found in Title 35: Environmental Protection; Subtitle B: Air Pollution; Chapter I: Pollution Control Board; Subchapter C: Emission Standards and Limitations for Stationary Sources; Part 220: Nonmethane Organic Compounds of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC). Part 220 was adopted by the IPCB on June 17, 1998 and filed in the principal office on that day. Part 220 was published in the Illinois Register on July 10, 1998 at 22 Ill. Reg. 11790 and became effective on July 31, 1998. As part of the same rulemaking action, the IPCB amended 35 IAC Part 201: Permits and General Provisions; Subpart A: Definitions; Section 201.103 (a) by adding the following abbreviations: Mg = megagrams, M(3) = cubic meters, NMOC = nonmethane organic compounds, and yr = year. In Section 201.103 (b) the conversion factor for 1000 gal was changed from 3.785 cubic meters to 3.785 M(3). In Subpart C: Prohibitions, Section 201.146 was amended by adding paragraph (ggg) which states that municipal solid waste landfills with a maximum total design capacity of less than 2.5 million Mg or 2.5 million M(3) are not required to install a gas collection and control system pursuant to 35 Ill. Adm. Code 220 or 800 through 849 or Section 9.1 of the [Illinois Environmental Protection] Act. These amendments were published in the Illinois Register on July 10, 1998 at 22 Ill. Reg. 11824 and became effective on July 31, 1998.

              (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility that will be de-rated prior to the applicable final compliance date instead of complying with the emission limits of this subpart must meet the same increments of progress and achieve the de-rating by the final compliance date (specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section) that would be applicable to the affected facility if it did not de-rate. The owner or operator of an affected facility that will be de-rated must meet the reporting requirements of § 62.14109k. After de-rating is accomplished, the municipal waste combustor affected facility is no longer subject to this subpart.
            
            
              § 62.14109
              Reporting and recordkeeping and compliance and performance testing.
              (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility must comply with the reporting and recordkeeping provisions listed in 40 CFR 60.59b of subpart Eb, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
              (1) The siting requirements under 40 CFR 60.59b(a), (b)(5), and (d)(11) of subpart Eb and the notification of construction requirements under 40 CFR 60.59b(b) and (c) of subpart Eb do not apply.
              (2) 40 CFR 60.54b, 60.56b, and 60.58b(g)(5)(iii) of subpart Eb do not apply to this subpart (see §§ 62.14105 and 62.14107 of this subpart).
              (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility must comply with the compliance and performance testing methods and procedures listed in 40 CFR 60.58b of subpart Eb, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
              (c) The initial performance test must be completed within 180 days after the date of final compliance specified in § 62.14108, rather than the date for the initial performance test specified in 40 CFR 60.58b of subpart Eb.
              (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility may follow the alternative performance testing schedule for dioxin/furan emissions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

              (1) If all performance tests for all affected facilities at the MWC plant over a 2-year period indicate that dioxin/furan emissions are less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter total mass, corrected to 7 percent oxygen for all affected facilities located within a municipal waste combustor plant, the owner or operator of the municipal waste combustor plant may elect to conduct annual performance tests for one affected facility (i.e., unit) per year at the municipal waste combustor plant. At a minimum, a performance test for dioxin/furan emissions shall be conducted annually (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) for one affected facility at the municipal waste combustor plant. Each year a different affected facility at the municipal waste combustor plant shall be tested, and the affected facilities at the plant shall be tested in sequence (e.g., unit 1, unit 2, unit 3, as applicable). If each annual performance test continues to indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), the owner or operator may continue conducting a performance test on only one affected facility per year. If any annual performance test indicates a dioxin/furan emission level greater than 15 nanograms per dry standrd cubic meter (total mass), performance tests thereafter shall be conducted annually on all affected facilities at the plant until and unless all annual performance tests for all affected facilities at the plant over a 2-year period indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass).
              (2) The owner or operator who is following the alternative performance testing schedule for dioxin/furan emissions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may choose an alternative testing sequence (e.g., unit 1, 3, 2, 4) for affected facilities at the municipal waste combustor plant. The owner or operator must submit a request to EPA for approval of the alternative testing sequence. After approval, the alternative testing sequence is effective until a different testing sequence is received and approved by EPA.
              (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF final rule to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit notification to the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of completing each increment. Each notification must indicate which increment of progress specified in § 62.14108(a)(1) through (a)(5) has been achieved. The notification must be signed by the owner or operator of the affected facility.
              (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart who fails to meet any increment of progress specified in § 62.14108(a)(1) through (a)(5) according to the applicable schedule in § 62.14108 must submit notification to the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of the applicable date in § 62.14108 that the owner or operator failed to meet the increment.
              (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit a final control plan by the date specified in § 62.14108(b) with the notification required by § 62.14109(e). The final control plan must, at a minimum, include a description of the air pollution control devices or process changes that will be employed for each unit to comply with the emission limits and other requirements of this subpart.
              (h) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must submit a signed copy of the contract or contracts awarded according to the requirements of § 62.14108(a)(2) with the notification required by § 62.14109(e).

              (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is taking longer than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF to comply with the emission limits of this subpart must keep on site a copy of the final control plan required by § 62.14109(g).
              
              (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility that plans to cease operation of the affected facility on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the applicable compliance date specified in § 62.14108 must submit a notification by the date specified for the final control plan according to the schedule specified in paragraphs § 62.14108(b)(1) through (b)(4), as applicable. (Affected facilities that cease operation on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the compliance date specified in § 62.14108 are not required to submit a final control plan.) The notification must state the date by which the affected facility will cease operation. If the cease operation date is later than 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF, the owner or operator must enter into a legally binding closure agreement with EPA by the date the final control plan is due. The agreement must specify the date by which operation will cease.
              (k) The owner or operator of an affected facility that plans to de-rate the affected facility on or before December 19, 2000 rather than comply with the emission limits of this subpart by the compliance date specified in § 62.14108 must submit a final control plan as required by paragraph (g) of this section and submit notification of increments of progress as required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and § 62.14108(e) of this subpart.
              (1) The final control plan must, at a minimum, include the information in paragraphs (k)(1)(i) and (k)(1)(ii) of this section rather than the information in paragraph (g) of this section.
              (i) A description of the physical changes that will be made to accomplish the de-rating.
              (ii) Calculations of the current maximum combustion capacity and the planned maximum combustion capacity after the de-rating. (See the procedures specified in 40 CFR 60.58b(j) of subpart Eb for calculating municipal waste combustor unit capacity.)
              (2) The owner or operator must submit a signed copy of the contract or contracts awarded to initiate the de-rating with the notification required by paragraph (e) of this section.
              (l) The owner or operator of an affected facility that is ceasing operation more than 1 year following the date of publication of this subpart FFF must submit performance test results for dioxin/furan emissions conducted during or after 1990 for each affected facility by the date 1 year after the date of publication of this subpart FFF. The performance test shall be conducted according to the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (m) The owner or operator (or the State air pollution control authority) that is submitting alternative dates for increments 2, 3, and 4 according to § 62.14108(b)(4) must submit the alternative dates by the date specified for the final control plan according to the schedule specified in paragraphs § 62.14108 (b)(1) and (b)(2), as applicable. The owner or operator (or the State air pollution control authority) must submit a justification if any of the alternative dates are later than the increment dates in tables 4 or 5 of this subpart. The owner or operator must also submit the alternative dates and justification to the State.

              § 62.14350
              Scope and delegation of authority.
              (a) This subpart contains emission requirements and compliance schedules for the control of designated pollutants from certain municipal solid waste landfills in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subpart B. This municipal solid waste landfills Federal plan applies to each designated facility as defined in § 62.14352 of this subpart that is not covered by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan.
              (b) The following authorities shall be retained by the Administrator and not transferred to the State or Tribe upon delegation of authority to the State or Tribe to implement and enforce the Federal plan pursuant to sections 101(a)(3) and 111 of the Clean Air Act:

              (1) Approval of alternative methods to determine site-specific NMOC concentration (C NMOC) or site-specific methane generation rate constant (k) used in calculating the annual NMOC emission rate (as provided in 40 CFR 60.754(a)(5) of subpart WWW),
              (2) Alternative emission standards,
              (3) Major alternatives 1
                 to test methods,
              
                
                  1 Major changes to test methods or to monitoring are modifications made to a federally enforceable test method or to a federal monitoring requirement. These changes would involve the use of unproven technology or procedures or an entirely new method (which is sometimes necessary when the required test method or monitoring requirement is unsuitable).
              
              (4) Major alternatives to monitoring, or
              (5) Waivers of recordkeeping.
            
            
              
              § 62.14351
              Definitions.
              Terms used but not defined in this subpart have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subparts A, B, and WWW.
              
                Achieve final compliance means to connect and operate the collection and control system as specified in the final control plan. Within 180 days after the date the landfill is required to achieve final compliance, the initial performance test must be conducted.
              
                Award contract means the MSW landfill owner or operator enters into legally binding agreements or contractual obligations that cannot be canceled or modified without substantial financial loss to the MSW landfill owner or operator. The MSW landfill owner or operator may award a number of contracts to install the collection and control system. To meet this increment of progress, the MSW landfill owner or operator must award a contract or contracts to initiate on-site construction or installation of the collection and control system.
              
                Complete on-site construction means that all necessary collection system components and air pollution control devices identified in the final control plan are on site, in place, and ready for operation.
              
                Design capacity means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill can accept, as indicated in terms of volume or mass in the most recent permit issued by the State, local, or Tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually.
              
                EPA approved State plan means a State plan that EPA has approved based on the requirements in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B to implement and enforce 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc. An approved State plan becomes effective on the date specified in the notice published in the Federal Register announcing EPA's approval.
              
                Federal Indian Reservation means for purposes of the Clean Air Act, all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the reservation.
              
                Final control plan (Collection and control system design plan) means a plan that describes the collection and control system that will capture the gas generated within an MSW landfill. The collection and control system design plan must be prepared by a professional engineer and must describe a collection and control system that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2)(ii). The final control plan must contain engineering specifications and drawings of the collection and control system. The final control plan must include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting provisions of 40 CFR 60.753 through 60.758 proposed by the owner or operator. The final control plan must either conform with the specifications for active collection systems in 40 CFR 60.759 or include a demonstration that shows that based on the size of the landfill and the amount of waste expected to be accepted, the system is sized properly to collect the gas, control emissions of NMOC to the required level and meet the operational standards for a landfill.
              
                Indian Country means all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the reservation; all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a State; and all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same.
              
                Initiate on-site construction means to begin any of the following: installation of the collection and control system to be used to comply with the emission limits as outlined in the final control plan; physical preparation necessary for the installation of the collection and control system to be used to comply with the final emission limits as outlined in the final control plan; or, alteration of an existing collection and control system to be used to comply with the final emission limits as outlined in the final control plan.
              
                Modification means an increase in the permitted volume design capacity of the landfill by either horizontal or vertical expansion based on its permitted design capacity as of May 30, 1991. Modification does not occur until the owner or operator commences construction on the horizontal or vertical expansion.
              
                Municipal solid waste landfill or MSW landfill means an entire disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household waste is placed in or on land. A municipal solid waste landfill may also receive other types of RCRA Subtitle D wastes such as commercial solid waste, nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of a municipal solid waste landfill may be separated by access roads. A municipal solid waste landfill may be publicly or privately owned.
              
                Negative declaration letter means a letter to EPA declaring that there are no existing MSW landfills in the State or that there are no existing MSW landfills in the State that must install collection and control systems according to the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc. The negative declaration letter must include the design capacities of any existing MSW landfills with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters.
              
                Protectorate means American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands.
              
                State means any of the 50 United States and the protectorates of the United States.
              
                State plan means a plan submitted pursuant to section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 60, subpart B that implements and enforces 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc. State plans include plans developed by States, local agencies, and protectorates.
              
                Tribal plan means a plan submitted by a Tribal Authority pursuant to 40 CFR parts 9, 35, 49, 50, and 81 that implements and enforces 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc.
            
            
              § 62.14352
              Designated facilities.
              (a) The designated facility to which this subpart applies is each municipal solid waste landfill in all States, protectorates, and Indian Country that meets the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, except for landfills exempted by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
              (1) The municipal solid waste landfill commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification before May 30, 1991 (landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991 are subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW), and
              (2) The municipal solid waste landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987 or the landfill has additional capacity for future waste deposition.
              (b) A municipal solid waste landfill regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is not subject to the requirements of this subpart. States that have an approved and effective State plan are listed in table 1 of this subpart. Notwithstanding the exclusions in table 1 of this subpart, any MSW landfill located in a State or portion of Indian country that does not have an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is subject to the requirements of this subpart.

              (c) A municipal solid waste landfill located in a State, locality, or portion of Indian country that submitted a negative declaration letter is not subject to the requirements of this subpart other than the requirements in the definition of design capacity to recalculate the site-specific density annually and in § 62.14355 to submit an amended design capacity report in the event that the recalculated design capacity is equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. However, if the existing municipal solid waste landfill already has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, then it is subject to the requirements of the Federal plan. States, localities, or portions of Indian country that submitted negative declaration letters are listed in table 2 of this subpart.
              (d) Physical or operational changes made to an existing municipal solid waste landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing municipal solid waste landfill to the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW.
              (e) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2,000 and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter April 6, 2000, even if the initial design capacity report is submitted earlier. In addition, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2000, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, but whose design capacity subsequently increases to equal or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters by a change that is not a modification or reconstruction becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter upon the date the amended design capacity report is due.
              (f) When a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart is closed, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:
              (1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control system under § 62.14353 of this subpart; or
              (2) The owner or operator meets the conditions for control system removal specified in 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2)(v).
            
            
              § 62.14353
              Standards for municipal solid waste landfill emissions.
              (a) The owner or operator of a designated facility having a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.752(a) in addition to the applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements specified in this subpart.
              (b) The owner or operator of a designated facility having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.752(b) in addition to the applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements specified in this subpart.
            
            
              § 62.14354
              Procedures, test methods, and monitoring.
              (a) The owner or operator of a designated facility having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters must calculate the landfill nonmethane organic compounds emission rate using the procedures listed in 40 CFR 60.754, as applicable, to determine whether the landfill nonmethane organic compounds emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams per year.
              (b) The owner or operator of a designated facility with a gas collection and control system used to comply with § 62.14353(b) must comply with the operational standards in 40 CFR 60.753; the test procedures in 40 CFR 60.754(b) and (d); the compliance provisions in 40 CFR 60.755; and the monitoring provisions in 40 CFR 60.756, unless alternative procedures have been approved.
            
            
              
              § 62.14355
              Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
              (a) The owner or operator of a designated facility must comply with the recordkeeping and reporting provisions listed in 40 CFR 60.757 and 60.758, except as provided for under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
              (1) The initial design capacity report for a designated facility is due within 90 days of the effective date of this subpart. Existing MSW landfills with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters that are located in States that submitted a negative declaration letter are not required to submit an initial design capacity report provided that the MSW landfill's design capacity was included in the negative declaration letter.
              (2) The initial nonmethane organic compounds emission rate report for a designated facility is due within 90 days of the effective date of this subpart.
              (b) The owner or operator of a designated facility must submit notification to the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of completing each increment of progress. Each notification must indicate which increment of progress specified in § 62.14356(a)(1) through (a)(5) of this subpart has been achieved. The notification must be signed by the owner or operator of the landfill.
              (1) For the first increment of progress, the final control plan (collection and control system design plan) must be submitted in addition to the notification. A copy of the design plan must also be kept on site at the landfill.
              (2) For the second increment of progress, a signed copy of the contract(s) awarded must be submitted in addition to the notification.
              (c) The owner or operator of a designated facility who fails to meet any increment of progress specified in § 62.14356(a)(1) through (a)(5) of this subpart according to the applicable schedule in § 62.14356 of this subpart must submit notification that the owner or operator failed to meet the increment to the EPA Regional Office within 10 business days of the applicable date in § 62.14356.
              (d) The owner or operator (or the State or Tribal air pollution control authority) that is submitting alternative dates for increments 2 and 3 according to § 62.14356(d) of this subpart must do so by the date specified for submitting the final control plan. The date for submitting the final control plan is specified in § 62.14356(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this subpart, as applicable. The owner or operator (or the State or Tribal air pollution control authority) must submit a justification if any of the alternative dates are later than the increment dates in table 3 of this subpart. In addition to submitting the alternative dates to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator must also submit the alternative dates to the State.
            
            
              § 62.14356
              Compliance schedules and increments of progress.
              (a) Increments of progress. The owner or operator of a designated facility that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters and a nonmethane organic compound emission rate greater than or equal to 50 megagrams per year must achieve the increments of progress specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section to install air pollution control devices to meet the emission standards specified in § 62.14353(b) of this subpart. (Refer to § 62.14351 for a definition of each increment of progress.)
              (1) Submit control plan: Submit a final control plan (collection and control system design plan) according to the requirements of § 62.14353(b) of this subpart and 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2).
              (2) Award contract(s): Award contract(s) to initiate on-site construction or initiate on-site installation of emission collection and/or control equipment.
              (3) Initiate on-site construction: Initiate on-site construction or initiate on-site installation of emission collection and/or control equipment as described in the EPA-approved final control plan.

              (4) Complete on-site construction: Complete on-site construction and installation of emission collection and/or control equipment.
              
              (5) Achieve final compliance: Complete construction in accordance with the design specified in the EPA-approved final control plan and connect the landfill gas collection system and air pollution control equipment such that they are fully operating. The initial performance test must be conducted within 180 days after the date the facility is required to achieve final compliance.
              (b) Compliance date. For each designated facility that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters and a nonmethane organic compound emission rate greater than or equal to 50 Mg per year, planning, awarding of contracts, and installation of municipal solid waste landfill air emission collection and control equipment capable of meeting the standards in § 62.14353(b) must be accomplished within 30 months after the date the initial emission rate report (or the annual emission rate report) first shows that the nonmethane organic compounds emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams per year.
              (c) Compliance schedules. The owner or operator of a designated facility that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters and a nonmethane organic compound emission rate greater than or equal to 50 megagrams per year must achieve the increments of progress specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section according to the schedule specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, unless a site-specific schedule is approved by EPA.

              (1) The owner or operator of a designated facility must achieve the increments of progress according to the schedule in table 3 of this subpart, except for those affected facilities specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Once this subpart becomes effective on January 7, 2000, any designated facility to which this subpart applies will remain subject to the schedule in table 3 if a subsequently approved State or Tribal plan contains a less stringent schedule, (i.e., a schedule that provides more time to comply with increments 1, 4 and/or 5 than does this Federal plan).
              (2) The owner or operator of the specified designated facility in table 4 of this subpart must achieve the increments of progress according to the schedule in table 4 of this subpart.
              (d) For designated facilities that are subject to the schedule requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the owner or operator (or the State or Tribal air pollution control authority) may submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office for approval alternative dates for achieving increments 2 and 3.

                § 62.14401
                How do I determine if my HMIWI is covered by an approved and effective State or Tribal plan?
                This part (40 CFR part 62) contains a list of all states and tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d)/129 plans in effect. However, this part is only updated once a year. Thus, if this part does not indicate that your state or tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your state environmental agency's air director or your EPA Regional Office to determine if approval occurred since publication of the most recent version of this part. A state may also meet its CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its 111(d)/129 obligations.
                (a) An acceptable Federal plan delegation request must include the following:
                (1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the Federal plan.
                (2) The items under §§ 60.25(a) and 60.39e(c).
                (3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.
                (4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in the EPA's Delegation Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)(2)/129(b)(3) Federal plans.
                (b) A state with an already approved HMIWI CAA section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the revised Federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of the EPA's previous state plan approval.
                (c) A state's CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under Title V of the CAA.

              Waste Management Plan
              
                § 62.14430
                Must I prepare a waste management plan?
                Yes. All HMIWI owners or operators must have a waste management plan.
              
              
                § 62.14431
                What must my waste management plan include?

                (a) Your waste management plan must identify both the feasibility of, and the approach for, separating certain components of solid waste from the health care waste stream in order to reduce the amount of toxic emissions from incinerated waste. The waste management plan you develop may address, but is not limited to, elements such as segregation and recycling of paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, batteries, food waste and metals (e.g., aluminum cans, metals-containing devices); segregation of non-recyclable wastes (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyl-containing waste, pharmaceutical waste, and mercury-containing waste such as dental waste); and purchasing recycled or recyclable products. Your waste management plan may include different goals or approaches for different areas or departments of the facility and need not include new waste management goals for every waste stream. When you develop your waste management plan, it should identify, where possible, reasonably available additional waste management measures, taking into account the effectiveness of waste management measures already in place, the costs of additional measures, the emissions reductions expected to be achieved, and any other potential environmental or energy impacts they might have. In developing your waste management plan, you must consider the American Hospital Association (AHA) publication titled “Ounce of Prevention: Waste Reduction Strategies for Health Care Facilities.” This publication (AHA Catalog Number 057007) is available for purchase from AHA Services, Inc., Post Office Box 933283, Atlanta, Georgia 31193-3283.
                (b) If you own or operate commercial HMIWI, you must conduct training and education programs in waste segregation for each of your waste generator clients and ensure that each client prepares its own waste management plan that includes, but is not limited to, the provisions listed in this section.
                (c) If you own or operate commercial HMIWI, you must conduct training and education programs in waste segregation for your HMIWI operators.

                § 62.14451
                What are the testing requirements for HMIWI that are not small rural?

                (a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, you must conduct an initial performance test for PM, opacity, CO, dioxin/furan, HCl, Pb, Cd, Hg, SO2, NOX and fugitive ash emissions using the test methods and procedures outlined in § 62.14452.
                (b) After the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 62.14470, whichever date comes first, you must:
                (1) Determine compliance with the opacity limit by conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 62.14452.
                (2) Determine compliance with the PM, CO, and HCl emission limits by conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 62.14452. If all three performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), you may forego a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. At a minimum, you must conduct a performance test for PM, CO, and HCl every third year (no more than 36 months following the previous performance test). If a performance test conducted every third year indicates compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), you may forego a performance test for that pollutant for an additional 2 years. If any performance test indicates noncompliance with the respective emission limit, you must conduct a performance test for that pollutant annually until all annual performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the emission limit.
                (3) If you use a large HMIWI that commenced construction or modification according to § 62.14400(a)(2)(ii), determine compliance with the visible emissions limits for fugitive emissions from flyash/bottom ash storage and handling by conducting a performance test using EPA Reference Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 on an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous performance test).
                (c) The 2,000 lb/wk limitation for small rural HMIWI does not apply during performance tests.
                (d) The EPA Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
                (e) You may use the results of previous emissions tests to demonstrate compliance with the emissions limits, provided that the conditions in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section are met:
                (1) Your previous emissions tests must have been conducted using the applicable procedures and test methods listed in § 62.14452. Previous emissions test results obtained using the EPA-accepted voluntary consensus standards are also acceptable.

                (2) The HMIWI at your facility must currently be operated in a manner (e.g., with charge rate, secondary chamber temperature, etc.) that would be expected to result in the same or lower emissions than observed during the previous emissions test(s), and the HMIWI may not have been modified such that emissions would be expected to exceed the results from previous emissions test(s).
                (3) The previous emissions test(s) must have been conducted in 1996 or later.

                (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under representative operating conditions;
                (b) The minimum sample time must be 1 hour per test run unless otherwise indicated in this section;

                (c) You must use EPA Reference Method 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1 to select the sampling location and number of traverse points;
                
                (d) You must use EPA Reference Method 3, 3A or 3B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2 for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. You must use EPA Reference Method 3, 3A or 3B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2 simultaneously with each reference method. You may use ASME PTC-19-10-1981-Part 10 (incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 60.17) as an alternative to EPA Reference Method 3B;
                (e) You must adjust pollutant concentrations to 7 percent oxygen using the following equation:
                
                  ER15AU00.000
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
                  Cmeas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis at standard conditions
                  (20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen—7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis);
                  20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
                  %O2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis at standard conditions, percent.
                
                
                (f) You must use EPA Reference Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3 or Method 26A or Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8 to measure particulate matter (PM) emissions.

                (h) You must use EPA Reference Method 7 or 7E of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4 to measure NOX emissions;
                (i) You must use EPA Reference Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4 to measure stack opacity. You may use bag leak detection systems, as specified in § 62.14454(e), or PM CEMS, as specified in paragraph (o) of this section, as an alternative to demonstrate compliance with the opacity requirements;
                (j) You must use EPA Reference Method 10 or 10B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4 to measure the CO emissions. You may use CO CEMS, as specified in paragraph (o) of this section, as an alternative to demonstrate compliance with the CO emissions limit;
                (k) You must use EPA Reference Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 to measure total dioxin/furan emissions. The minimum sample time must be 4 hours per test run. You may elect to sample dioxins/furans by installing, calibrating, maintaining and operating a continuous automated sampling system, as specified in paragraph (p) of this section, as an alternative to demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan emissions limit. If you have selected the toxic equivalency (TEQ) standards for dioxin/furans under § 62.14411, you must use the following procedures to determine compliance:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra-through octa-congener emitted using EPA Reference Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7;
                (2) For each dioxin/furan congener measured in accordance with paragraph (k)(1) of this section, multiply the congener concentration by its corresponding TEQ factor specified in Table 2 of this subpart;
                (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (k)(2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of TEQ.
                (l) You must use EPA Reference Method 26 or 26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8 to measure HCl emissions. You may use HCl CEMS as an alternative to demonstrate compliance with the HCl emissions limit;

                (m) You must use EPA Reference Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8 to measure Pb, Cd and Hg emissions. You may use ASTM D6784-02 (incorporated by reference in 40 CFR 60.17) as an alternative to EPA Reference Method 29 for measuring Hg emissions. You may also use Hg CEMS, as specified in paragraph (o) of this section, or a continuous automated sampling system for monitoring Hg emissions, as specified in paragraph (q) of this section, as an alternative to demonstrate compliance with the Hg emissions limit. You may use multi-metals CEMS, as specified in paragraph (o) of this section, as an alternative to EPA Reference Method 29 to demonstrate compliance with the Pb, Cd or Hg emissions limits;
                (n) You must use EPA Reference Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 to measure fugitive ash emissions and determine compliance with the fugitive ash emissions limit, as applicable, under § 60.52c(c). The minimum observation time must be a series of three 1-hour observations.
                (o) If you are using a CEMS to demonstrate compliance with any of the emissions limits under §§ 62.14411 or 62.14412, you:
                (1) Must determine compliance with the appropriate emissions limit(s) using a 12-hour rolling average, calculated as specified in section 12.4.1 of EPA Reference Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. Performance tests using EPA Reference Methods are not required for pollutants monitored with CEMS.
                (2) Must operate a CEMS to measure oxygen concentration, adjusting pollutant concentrations to 7 percent oxygen as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

                (3) Must operate all CEMS in accordance with the applicable procedures under appendices B and F of 40 CFR part 60. For those CEMS for which performance specifications have not yet been promulgated (HCl, multi-metals), this option takes effect on the date a final performance specification is published in the Federal Register or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan.
                (4) May substitute use of a CO CEMS for the CO annual performance test and minimum secondary chamber temperature to demonstrate compliance with the CO emissions limit.
                (5) May substitute use of an HCl CEMS for the HCl annual performance test, minimum HCl sorbent flow rate and minimum scrubber liquor pH to demonstrate compliance with the HCl emissions limit.
                (6) May substitute use of a PM CEMS for the PM annual performance test and minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, if applicable, to demonstrate compliance with the PM emissions limit.

                (p) If you are using a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan emissions limits, you must record the output of the system and analyze the sample according to EPA Reference Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to dioxin/furan from monitors is published in the Federal Register or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan. If you elect to continuously sample dioxin/furan emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Reference Method 23 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, you must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous automated sampling system and comply with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 60.58b(p) and (q) of subpart Eb.

                (q) If you are using a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with the Hg emissions limits, you must record the output of the system and analyze the sample at set intervals using any suitable determinative technique that can meet appropriate performance criteria. This option to use a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to Hg from monitors is published in the Federal Register or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan. If you elect to continuously sample Hg emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Reference Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, or an approved alternative method for measuring Hg emissions, you must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous automated sampling system and comply with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 60.58b(p) and (q) of subpart Eb.
                
                (r) Use of the bypass stack during a performance test will invalidate the performance test.

                § 62.14454
                How must I monitor the required parameters?
                (a) Except as provided in §§ 62.14452(o) through (q), you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate devices (or establish methods) for monitoring the applicable maximum and minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 of this subpart (unless CEMS are used as a substitute for certain parameters as specified) such that these devices (or methods) measure and record values for the operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in Table 3 of this subpart at all times. For charge rate, the device must measure and record the date, time and weight of each charge fed to the HMIWI. This must be done automatically, meaning that the only intervention from an operator during the process would be to load the charge onto the weighing device. For batch HMIWI, the maximum charge rate is measured on a daily basis (the amount of waste charged to the unit each day).
                (b) For all HMIWI, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate a device or method for measuring the use of the bypass stack, including the date, time and duration of such use.
                (c) For all HMIWI, if you are using controls other than a dry scrubber followed by a FF, a wet scrubber, a dry scrubber followed by a FF and a wet scrubber, or a SNCR system to comply with the emissions limits under § 62.14411, you must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), maintain and operate the equipment necessary to monitor the site-specific operating parameters developed pursuant to § 62.14453(b).
                (d) You must obtain monitoring data at all times during HMIWI operation except during periods of monitoring equipment malfunction, calibration, or repair. At a minimum, valid monitoring data must be obtained for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter that your HMIWI is combusting hospital waste and/or medical/infectious waste.

                (e) If you use an air pollution control device that includes a FF and are not demonstrating compliance using PM CEMS, you must determine compliance with the PM emissions limit using a bag leak detection system and meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (12) of this section for each bag leak detection system.
                
                (1) Each triboelectric bag leak detection system must be installed, calibrated, operated and maintained according to the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D-243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emissions Measurement Center Continuous Emissions Monitoring. Other types of bag leak detection systems must be installed, operated, calibrated and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.
                (2) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
                (3) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide an output of relative PM loadings.
                (4) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.
                (5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an audible alarm system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative PM emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.
                (6) For positive pressure FF systems, a bag leak detector must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.
                (7) For negative pressure or induced air FF, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the FF.
                (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
                (9) The baseline output must be established by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance.”
                (10) Following initial adjustment of the system, the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points or alarm delay time may not be adjusted. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete FF inspection that demonstrates that the FF is in good operating condition. Each adjustment must be recorded.
                (11) Record the results of each inspection, calibration and validation check.
                (12) Initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection system alarm; operate and maintain the FF such that the alarm is not engaged for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period. If inspection of the FF demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time is counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.

              Permitting Obligation
              
                § 62.14480
                Does this subpart require me to obtain an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act and implementing regulations?
                This subpart requires you to obtain an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act and implementing regulations (“title V permit”) unless you are only subject to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements listed at § 62.14400(b)(1) or (b)(2), and § 62.14400(c), of this subpart. Also, if you own or operate a unit described in § 62.14400(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5) or (b)(6), you are not subject to any requirements of this subpart; therefore, this subpart does not require you to obtain a title V permit.
              
              
                § 62.14481
                When must I submit a title V permit application for my HMIWI?
                You must submit a title V permit application in time for it to be determined or deemed complete by no later than September 15, 2000 or by the effective date of a title V permits program in the jurisdiction in which the unit is located, whichever is later. (An earlier deadline may apply if your HMIWI is also subject to title V permitting requirements because of some other triggering requirement.) A “complete” title V permit application is one that has been approved by the appropriate permitting authority as complete under Section 503 of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR parts 70 and 71. It is not enough to have submitted a title V permit application by September 15, 2000 because the application must be determined or deemed complete by the permitting authority by that date for your HMIWI to operate after that date in compliance with Federal law.

              Introduction
              
                § 62.14500
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                (a) This subpart establishes emission requirements and compliance schedules for the control of emissions from commercial and industrial solid waste incineration (CISWI) units that are not covered by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan. The pollutants addressed by these emission requirements are listed in Table 1 of this subpart. These emission requirements are developed in accordance with sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of 40 CFR part 60.
                (b) In this subpart, “you” means the owner or operator of a CISWI unit.
              
              
                § 62.14505
                What are the principal components of this subpart?
                This subpart contains the eleven major components listed in paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section.
                (a) Increments of progress toward compliance.
                (b) Waste management plan.
                (c) Operator training and qualification.
                (d) Emission limitations and operating limits.
                (e) Performance testing.
                (f) Initial compliance requirements.
                (g) Continuous compliance requirements.

              Applicability
              
                § 62.14510
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a CISWI unit as defined in § 62.14840 and the CISWI unit meets the criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
                (1) Construction of your CISWI unit commenced on or before November 30, 1999.
                (2) Your CISWI unit is not exempt under § 62.14525.
                (3) Your CISWI unit is not regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan, or your CISWI unit is located in any State whose approved State or Tribal plan is subsequently vacated in whole or in part.
                (b) If you made changes after June 1, 2001 that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction after promulgation of the final 40 CFR part 60 subpart CCCC (New Source Performance Standards for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units), your CISWI unit is subject to subpart CCCC of 40 CFR part 60 and this subpart no longer applies to that unit.
                (c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing CISWI unit primarily to comply with this subpart, then such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under subpart CCCC of 40 CFR part 60.
              
              
                § 62.14515
                Can my CISWI unit be covered by both a State plan and this subpart?
                (a) If your CISWI unit is located in a State that does not have an EPA-approved State plan or your State's plan has not become effective, this subpart applies to your CISWI unit until the EPA approves a State plan that covers your CISWI unit and that State plan becomes effective. However, a State may enforce the requirements of a State regulation while your CISWI unit is still subject to this subpart.
                (b) After the EPA approves a State plan covering your CISWI unit, and after that State plan becomes effective, you will no longer be subject to this subpart and will only be subject to the approved and effective State plan.
              
              
                § 62.14520
                How do I determine if my CISWI unit is covered by an approved and effective State or Tribal plan?

                This part (40 CFR part 62) contains a list of State and Tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act section 111(d) and section 129 plans along with the effective dates for such plans. The list is published annually. If this part does not indicate that your State or Tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your State environmental agency's air director or your EPA Regional Office to determine if the EPA has approved a State plan covering your unit since publication of the most recent version of this subpart.
              
              
                § 62.14521
                If my CISWI unit is not listed in the Federal plan inventory, am I exempt from this subpart?
                If a CISWI unit is not listed in the Federal plan inventory, it is not necessarily exempt from this subpart. Sources subject to this subpart are not limited to the inventory of sources listed in Docket A-2000-52 for the Federal plan. If your CISWI units meets the applicability criteria in § 62.14510, this subpart applies to you whether or not your unit is listed in the Federal plan inventory in the docket.

                § 62.14630
                What emission limitations must I meet and by when?
                You must meet the emission limitations specified in table 1 of this subpart by the applicable final compliance date for your CISWI unit.
              
              
                § 62.14635
                What operating limits must I meet and by when?
                (a) If you use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitations, you must establish operating limits for four operating parameters (as specified in table 2 of this subpart) as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial performance test.
                (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
                (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
                (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
                (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, which is calculated as 90 percent of the average pressure drop across the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as 90 percent of the average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.
                (3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as 90 percent of the average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
                (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as 90 percent of the average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen chloride emission limitation.
                (b) You must meet the operating limits established during the initial performance test on the date the initial performance test is required or completed (whichever is earlier).
                (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limitations, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during any 6-month period. In calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.
              
              
                
                § 62.14640

                If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, or limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the emission limitations under § 62.14630, you must petition the Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has been approved by the Administrator. Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
                (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as additional operating limits.
                (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants.
                (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on these parameters.
                (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
                (e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.

                (b) Each malfunction must last no longer than 3 hours.
              
            
            
              Performance Testing
              
                § 62.14650
                How do I conduct the initial and annual performance test?
                (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations.
                (b) You must document that the waste burned during the performance test is representative of the waste burned under normal operating conditions by maintaining a log of the quantity of waste burned (as required in § 62.14700(b)(1)) and the types of waste burned during the performance test.
                (c) All performance tests must be conducted using the minimum run duration specified in Table 1 of this subpart.
                (d) Method 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A must be used to select the sampling location and number of traverse points.
                (e) Method 3A or 3B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A must be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. Method 3A or 3B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A must be used simultaneously with each method.

                (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:
                
                Cadj = C meas (20.9−7)/(20.9−%O2) (Eq. 1)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
                  Cmeas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis;
                  (20.9−7) = 20.9 percent oxygen−7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis);
                  20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
                  %O2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
                
                
                (g) You must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency by following the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octa-congener emitted using EPA Method 23.

                (2) For each dioxin/furan congener measured in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, multiply the congener concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 3 of this subpart.
                (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
              
              
                § 62.14655
                How are the performance test data used?
                You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart.
              
            
            
              Initial Compliance Requirements
              
                § 62.14660
                How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations and establish the operating limits?
                You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 40 CFR 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the procedure in § 62.14635 or § 62.14640. The initial performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in § 62.14650.
              
              
                § 62.14665
                By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?
                The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 90 days after your final compliance date.
              
            
            
              Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 62.14670
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations and the operating limits?
                (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity for each CISWI unit as required under 40 CFR 60.8 to determine compliance with the emission limitations. The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods listed in table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in § 62.14650.
                (b) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in § 62.14635 or established under § 62.14640. Operation above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance (except for baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging period is established under § 62.14640. Operating limits do not apply during performance tests.
                (c) You must only burn the same types of waste used to establish operating limits during the performance test.
              
              
                § 62.14675
                By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?
                You must conduct annual performance tests for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity within 12 months following the initial performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance tests within 12 months following the previous one.
              
              
                § 62.14680
                May I conduct performance testing less often?
                (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test data for at least 3 years, and all performance tests for the pollutant (particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity) over 3 consecutive years show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year and no later than 36 months following the previous performance test.
                (b) If your CISWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you may choose to conduct performance tests for these pollutants every third year, but each test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.
                (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over a 3-year period show compliance.
              
              
                
                § 62.14685
                May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish new operating limits?
                (a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
                (b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to demonstrate compliance.

                (4) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative or absolute particulate matter loadings.
                (5) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.
                (6) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm must be located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.
                (7) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detection system must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell. For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter.
                (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
                (c) If you are using an emission control system other than a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under § 62.14630, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established using the procedures in § 62.14640.

              Air Curtain Incinerators That Burn 100 Percent Wood Wastes, Clean Lumber and/or Yard Waste
              
                § 62.14765
                What is an air curtain incinerator?

                An air curtain incinerator operates by forcefully projecting a curtain of air across an open chamber or open pit in which combustion occurs. Incinerators of this type can be constructed above or below ground and with or without refractory walls and floor. (Air curtain incinerators are different from conventional combustion devices which typically have enclosed fireboxes and controlled air technology such as mass burn, modular, and fluidized bed combustors.)
              
              
                § 62.14770
                When must I achieve final compliance?
                If you plan to continue operating, then you must achieve final compliance by October October 4, 2004. It is unlawful for your air curtain incinerator to operate after October 4, 2004 if you have not achieved final compliance. An air curtain incinerator that continues to operate after October 4, 2004 without being in compliance is subject to penalties.
              
              
                § 62.14795
                How do I achieve final compliance?
                For the final compliance, you must complete all equipment changes and retrofit installation control devices so that, when the affected air curtain incinerator is placed into service, all necessary equipment and air pollution control devices operate as designed and meet the opacity limits of § 62.14815.
              
              
                § 62.14805
                What must I do if I close my air curtain incinerator and then restart it?
                (a) If you close your incinerator but will reopen it prior to the final compliance date in this subpart, you must achieve final compliance by October 4, 2004.
                (b) If you close your incinerator but will restart it after October 4, 2004, you must have completed any needed emission control retrofits and meet the opacity limits of § 62.14815 on the date your incinerator restarts operation.
                (c) You are subject to the operating permit requirements of title V of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70 or 71 until you close your air curtain incinerator and at the time you restart it.
              
              
                § 62.14810
                What must I do if I plan to permanently close my air curtain incinerator and not restart it?
                If you plan to permanently close your incinerator rather than comply with this subpart, you must submit a closure notification, including the date of closure, to the Administrator by March 31, 2004. In addition, while still in operation, your air curtain incinerator is subject to the same requirement to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit that applies to an air curtain incinerator that will not be permanently closing.
              
              
                § 62.14815
                What are the emission limitations for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean lumber and/or yard waste?
                (a) After the date the initial test for opacity is required or completed (whichever is earlier), you must meet the limitations in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
                (1) The opacity limitation is 10 percent (6-minute average), except as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
                (2) The opacity limitation is 35 percent (6-minute average) during the startup period that is within the first 30 minutes of operation.
                (b) Except during malfunctions, the requirements of this subpart apply at all times, and each malfunction must not exceed 3 hours.
              
              
                § 62.14820
                How must I monitor opacity for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean lumber, and/or yard waste?
                (a) Use Method 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to determine compliance with the opacity limitation.
                (b) Conduct an initial test for opacity as specified in § 60.8 no later than January 2, 2005.
                (c) After the initial test for opacity, conduct annual tests no more than 12 calendar months following the date of your previous test.
              
              
                § 62.14825
                What are the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent wood wastes, clean lumber, and/or yard waste?
                (a) Keep records of results of all initial and annual opacity tests onsite in either paper copy or electronic format, unless the Administrator approves another format, for at least 5 years.
                (b) Make all records available for submittal to the Administrator or for an inspector's onsite review.

                (c) Submit an initial report no later than 60 days following the initial opacity test that includes the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
                
                (1) The types of materials you plan to combust in your air curtain incinerator.
                (2) The results (each 6-minute average) of the initial opacity tests.
                (d) Submit annual opacity test results within 12 months following the previous report.
                (e) Submit initial and annual opacity test reports as electronic or paper copy on or before the applicable submittal date and keep a copy onsite for a period of five years.

            Subpart JJJ—Federal Plan Requirements for Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units Constructed on or Before August 30, 1999
            
              Source:
              68 FR 5158, Jan. 31, 2003, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              Introduction
              
                § 62.15000
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                (a) This subpart establishes emission requirements and compliance schedules for the control of emissions from existing small municipal waste combustion units that are not covered by an EPA approved and effective State plan. The pollutants addressed by these emission requirements are listed in tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. These emission requirements are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of 40 CFR part 60.
                (b) In this subpart, “you” means the owner or operator of a small municipal waste combustion unit.
              
              
                § 62.15005
                What are the principal components of this subpart?
                This subpart contains five major components:
                (a) Increments of progress toward compliance.
                (b) Good combustion practices:
                (1) Operator training.
                (2) Operator certification.
                (3) Operating requirements.
                (c) Emission limits.
                (d) Monitoring and stack testing.
                (e) Recordkeeping and reporting.
              
            
            
              Applicability of this Subpart
              
                § 62.15010
                Is my municipal waste combustion unit covered by this subpart?
                (a) This subpart applies to your small municipal waste combustion unit if the unit meets the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) and the criteria in either paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section:
                (1) Your municipal waste combustion unit has the capacity to combust at least 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel but no more than 250 tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
                (2) Your municipal waste combustion unit commenced construction on or before August 30, 1999.
                (3) Your municipal waste combustion unit is not regulated by an EPA approved and effective State or Tribal plan.

                (4) Your municipal waste combustion unit is located in any State whose approved State plan is subsequently vacated in whole or in part, or the municipal waste combustion unit is located in Indian country if the approved tribal plan for that area is subsequently vacated in whole or in part.
                (b) If you make a change to your municipal waste combustion unit that meets the definition of modification or reconstruction after June 6, 2001, your municipal waste combustion unit becomes subject to subpart AAAA of 40 CFR part 60 (New Source Performance Standards for Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units) and this subpart no longer applies to your unit.
                (c) If you make physical or operational changes to your existing municipal waste combustion unit primarily to comply with this subpart, then subpart AAAA of 40 CFR part 60 (New Source Performance Standards for Small Municipal Waste Combustion Units) does not apply to your unit. Such changes do not constitute modifications or reconstructions under subpart AAAA of 40 CFR part 60.
                (d) Upon approval of the State or tribal plan, this subpart will no longer apply, except for the provisions of this subpart that may have been incorporated by reference under the State or Tribal plan, or delegated to the State by the Administrator.
              
              
                § 62.15015
                Can my small municipal waste combustion unit be covered by both a State plan and this subpart?
                (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit is located in a State that has a State plan that has not been approved by the EPA or has not become effective, then this subpart applies and the State plan would not apply to your municipal waste combustion unit. However, the State could enforce the requirements of a State regulation while your municipal waste combustion unit is still subject to this subpart.

                § 62.15140
                What if all the certified operators must be temporarily offsite?
                If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor both are unavailable, a provisionally certified control room operator at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor is away, you must meet one of three criteria:
                (a) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are both offsite for 12 hours or less and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator.
                (b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the periods when the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite and include this information in the annual report as specified under § 62.15340(l).
                (c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, you must take two actions:
                (1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.
                (2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may continue.

The total amount of carbon purchased and delivered to your municipal waste combustion plant must be at or above the required quarterly usage of carbon. At your option, you may choose to evaluate required quarterly carbon usage on a municipal waste combustion unit basis for each individual municipal waste combustion unit at your plant. Calculate the required quarterly usage of carbon using the appropriate equation in § 62.15390.
                (e) Your municipal waste combustion unit is exempt from limits on load level, temperature at the inlet of the particulate matter control device, and carbon feed rate during any of five situations:
                (1) During your annual tests for dioxins/furans.
                (2) During your annual mercury tests (for carbon feed rate requirements only).
                (3) During the 2 weeks preceding your annual tests for dioxins/furans.
                (4) During the 2 weeks preceding your annual mercury tests (for carbon feed rate requirements only).
                (5) Whenever the Administrator permits you to do any of five activities:
                (i) Evaluate system performance.
                (ii) Test new technology or control technologies.
                (iii) Perform diagnostic testing.
                (iv) Perform other activities to improve the performance of your municipal waste combustion unit.
                (v) Perform other activities to advance the state of the art for emission controls for your municipal waste combustion unit.

              Continuous Emission Monitoring
              
                § 62.15170
                What types of continuous emission monitoring must I perform?
                To continuously monitor emissions, you must perform four tasks:
                (a) Install continuous emission monitoring systems for certain gaseous pollutants.
                (b) Make sure your continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly.
                (c) Make sure you obtain the minimum amount of monitoring data.
                (d) Install a continuous opacity monitoring system.
              
              
                § 62.15175
                What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install for gaseous pollutants?
                (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous emission monitoring systems for oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system for nitrogen oxides. Install the continuous emission monitoring system for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the outlet of the air pollution control device.
                (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission monitoring system according to the “Monitoring Requirements” in § 60.13 of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60.
                (c) You must monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at each location where you monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Additionally, if you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, you must also monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at the location where you monitor nitrogen oxides.
                (d) You may choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a diluent gas. If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide, then an oxygen monitor is not required and you must follow the requirements in § 62.15200.
                (e) If you choose to demonstrate compliance by monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, you must also install a continuous emission monitoring system for sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the inlet of the air pollution control device.

                (f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at the inlet of the air pollution control device to determine percent reduction, you can apply to the Administrator for approval to use an alternative monitoring method under § 60.13(i) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60.
              
              
                § 62.15180
                How are the data from the continuous emission monitoring systems used?
                You must use data from the continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission limits specified in tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash, see § 62.15235.
              
              
                § 62.15185
                How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly?
                (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
                (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date.
                (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently (or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in table 6 of this subpart. Collect these data during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. Table 7 of this subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each continuous emission monitoring system.
                (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 for each continuous emission monitoring system. These procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy determinations.
              
              
                § 62.15190
                Am I exempt from any 40 CFR part 60 appendix B or appendix F requirements to evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?
                Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from two requirements:
                (a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 (relative accuracy requirement).
                (b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 (relative accuracy test audit).
              
              
                § 62.15195
                What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission monitoring systems?
                (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation was conducted.
                (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and quarterly as specified in appendix F of 40 CFR part 60.
              
              
                § 62.15200
                What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a diluent gas?
                You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring system. You may reestablish the relationship during annual evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
                (a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 to determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon dioxide monitor.
                (b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 30 minutes in each hour.
                (c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide.
              
              
                
                § 62.15205
                What minimum amount of monitoring data must I collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is this requirement enforceable?
                (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level). Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen (or carbon dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level).
                (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60 requires your continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute period.
                (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
                (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you are in violation of this data collection requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must notify the Administrator according to § 62.15340(e).
                (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with § 62.15210.
              
              
                § 62.15210
                How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into appropriate averaging times and units?
                (a) Use the equation in § 62.15390(a) to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen.
                (b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, section 4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of sulfur dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19, section 5.4, to determine the daily geometric average percent reduction of potential sulfur dioxide emissions.
                (c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use EPA Reference Method 19, section 4.1, to calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen oxides.
                (d) Use EPA Reference Method 19, section 4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.
              
              
                § 62.15215
                What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring system and how are the data used?
                (a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system.
                (b) Install, evaluate, and operate each continuous opacity monitoring system according to § 60.13 of subpart A 40 CFR part 60.
                (c) Complete an initial evaluation of your continuous opacity monitoring system according to Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. Complete this evaluation by 180 days after your final compliance date.
                (d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
                (e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9, as specified in § 62.15245, to determine compliance with the applicable opacity limit in tables 2 or 4 of this subpart. The data obtained from your continuous opacity monitoring system are not used to determine compliance with the opacity limit.
              
              
                § 62.15220
                What additional requirements must I meet for the operation of my continuous emission monitoring systems and continuous opacity monitoring system?
                Use the required span values and applicable performance specifications in table 8 of this subpart.
              
              
                
                § 62.15225
                What must I do if my continuous emission monitoring system is temporarily unavailable to meet the data collection requirements?
                Refer to table 8 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for collecting data when these systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum amount of data.
              
            
            
              Stack Testing
              
                § 62.15230

                § 62.15235
                How are the stack test data used?
                You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits in tables 2 and 4 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see § 62.15180.
              
              
                § 62.15240
                What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?
                (a) Conduct initial stack tests for the pollutants listed in § 62.15230 by 180 days after your final compliance date.
                (b) Conduct annual stack tests for these pollutants after the initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack test no later than 13 months after the previous stack test.
              
              
                § 62.15245
                What test methods must I use to stack test?
                (a) Follow table 8 of this subpart to establish the sampling location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements for the different pollutants.
                (b) Make sure that stack tests for all these pollutants consist of at least three test runs, as specified in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60. Use the average of the pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to determine compliance with the applicable emission limits in tables 2 and 4 of this subpart.
                (c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as specified in § 62.15175.
                (d) Use the equations in § 62.15390(a) to calculate emission levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test methods in table 6 of this subpart for other required equations.
                (e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under § 60.8(b) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60 to
                (1) Use a reference method with minor changes in methodology;
                (2) Use an equivalent method;
                (3) Use an alternative method the results of which the Administrator has determined are adequate for demonstrating compliance;
                (4) Waive the requirement for a performance test because you have demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance; or
                (5) Use a shorter sampling time or smaller sampling volume.
              
              
                § 62.15250
                May I conduct stack testing less often?

                (a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission limit. In this case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every third year but no later than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years show compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant. This provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
                (b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that are subject to this subpart. Second, all these municipal waste combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for 2 consecutive years. In this case, you may choose to conduct annual stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit per year at your plant. This provision only applies to stack testing for dioxins/furans emissions.
                (1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by the Administrator.
                (2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, you may continue stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year.
                (3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans emissions greater than 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, conduct subsequent annual stack tests on all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans emission levels less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for all municipal waste combustion units at your plant subject to this subpart for 2 consecutive years.
              
              
                § 62.15255
                May I deviate from the 13-month testing schedule if unforeseen circumstances arise?
                You may not deviate from the 13-month testing schedules specified in §§ 62.15240(b) and 62.15250(b)(1) unless you apply to the Administrator for an alternative schedule, and the Administrator approves your request for alternate scheduling prior to the date on which you would otherwise have been required to conduct the next stack test.
              
            
            
              Other Monitoring Requirements
              
                § 62.15260
                What other requirements must I meet for continuous monitoring?
                You must also monitor three operating parameters:
                (a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit.
                (b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate matter air pollution control device.
                (c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions.
              
              
                § 62.15265
                How do I monitor the load of my municipal waste combustion unit?
                (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit generates steam, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a steam flowmeter or a feed water flowmeter and meet five requirements:

                (5) Before each dioxins/furans stack test, or at least once a year, calibrate all signal conversion elements associated with steam (or feed water) flow measurements according to the manufacturer instructions.
                (b) If your municipal waste combustion unit does not generate steam, or, if your municipal waste combustion units have shared steam systems and steam load cannot be estimated per unit, you must determine, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, one or more operating parameters that can be used to continuously estimate load level (for example, the feed rate of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel). You must continuously monitor the selected parameters.

                How do I monitor the injection rate of activated carbon?
                If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must meet three requirements:
                (a) Select a carbon injection system operating parameter that can be used to calculate carbon feed rate (for example, screw feeder speed).
                (b) During each dioxins/furans and mercury stack test, determine the average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. Also, determine the average operating parameter level that correlates to the carbon feed rate. Establish a relationship between the operating parameter and the carbon feed rate in order to calculate the carbon feed rate based on the operating parameter level.
                (c) Continuously monitor the selected operating parameter during all periods when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating and combusting waste and calculate the 8-hour block average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour, based on the selected operating parameter. When calculating the 8-hour block average, do two things:
                (1) Exclude hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is not operating.

                (2) Include hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating but the carbon feed system is not working correctly.
              
              
                § 62.15280
                What minimum amount of monitoring data must I collect with my continuous parameter monitoring systems and is this requirement enforceable?
                (a) Where continuous parameter monitoring systems are used, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages for three parameters:
                (1) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit.
                (2) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of your particulate matter control device.
                (3) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions.
                (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average.
                (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
                (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you are in violation of this data collection requirement and you must notify the Administrator according to § 62.15340(e).

                (i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).
                (ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).

                (2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
                
                (e) Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 hours. Calculate this maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
                (f) Quarterly carbon usage. If you use activated carbon to comply with the dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required quarterly usage of carbon using equation 4 or 5 of this section for plant basis or unit basis:
                (1) Plant basis.

              Source:
              81 FR 26063, Apr. 29, 2016, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              Applicability
              
                § 62.15855
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                (a) You are subject to this subpart if your SSI unit meets all three criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) that commenced construction on or before October 14, 2010.
                (2) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) that meet the definition of an SSI unit as defined in § 62.16045.
                (3) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) not exempt under § 62.15860.
                (b) If you own or operator an SSI unit(s) and make changes that meet the definition of modification after September 21, 2011, the SSI unit becomes subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL, and the federal plan no longer applies to that unit.
                (c) If you own or operate an SSI unit(s) and make physical or operational changes to the SSI unit(s) for which construction commenced on or before September 21, 2011 primarily to comply with the federal plan, 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL, does not apply to the unit(s). Such changes do not qualify as modifications under 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL.
              
              
                
                § 62.15860
                What SSI units are exempt from the federal plan?

                This subpart exempts combustion units that incinerate sewage sludge and are not located at a wastewater treatment facility designed to treat domestic sewage sludge. These units may be subject to another subpart of this part (e.g., subpart III of this part). If you own or operate such a combustion unit, you must notify the Administrator of an exemption claim under this section.
              
              
                § 62.15865
                How do I determine if my SSI unit is covered by an approved and effective state or tribal plan?
                This part contains a list of all states and tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d)/129 plans in effect. However, this part is only updated once a year. Thus, if this part does not indicate that your state or tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your state environmental agency's air director or your EPA regional office to determine if approval occurred since publication of the most recent version of this part. A state may also meet its CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its 111(d)/129 obligations.
                (a) An acceptable federal plan delegation request must include the following:
                (1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the federal plan.
                (2) The items under § 60.5015(a)(1), (2), and (7) of this chapter.
                (3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.
                (4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in the EPA's “Delegations Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)(2)/129(b)(3) federal plans.”
                (b) A state with an already approved SSI CAA section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of the EPA's previous state plan approval.
                (c) A state's CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under title V of the CAA.
              
              
                § 62.15870
                If my SSI unit is not listed on the federal plan inventory, am I exempt from this subpart?
                Not necessarily. Sources subject to this subpart include, but are not limited to, the inventory of sources listed in Docket ID Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0319 for the federal plan. Review the applicability of § 62.15855 to determine if you are subject to this subpart.
              
            
            
              Compliance Schedules
              
                § 62.15875
                What is my final compliance date?
                Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must submit a final control plan and achieve final compliance specified by the date in paragraph (a) of this section:
                (a) March 21, 2016, as specified in Table 1 of this subpart.
                (b) March 21, 2017, for East Bank Wastewater Treatment Plant, 6501 Florida Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana 70117, and for the Bayshore Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant, 100 Oak Street, Union Beach, New Jersey 07735.

                § 62.15885
                What must I include in the notifications of achievement of compliance?

                Your notification of achievement of compliance must include the three items specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:
                
                (a) Notification that the final control plan has been submitted and final compliance has been achieved;
                (b) Any items required to be submitted with the final control plan and final compliance; and
                (c) Signature of the owner or operator of the SSI unit.
              
              
                § 62.15890
                When must I submit the notifications of achievement of compliance?
                Notifications for achieving compliance must be postmarked no later than 10 business days after the compliance date.
              
              
                § 62.15895
                What if I do not meet the compliance date?
                If you fail to submit a final control plan and achieve final compliance, you must submit a notification to the Administrator postmarked within 10 business days after the compliance date in Table 1 to this subpart. You must inform the Administrator that you did not achieve compliance, and you must continue to submit reports each subsequent calendar month until a final control plan is submitted and final compliance is met. An SSI unit that operates out of compliance after the final compliance date would be in violation of the federal plan and subject to enforcement action.
              
              
                § 62.15900
                How do I comply with the requirement for submittal of a control plan?
                For your control plan, you must satisfy the two requirements specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
                (a) Submit the final control plan to your EPA regional office and permitting authority or delegated authority that includes the four items described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:

                You must renew a lapsed operator qualification before you begin operation of an SSI unit by one of the two methods specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
                (a) For a lapse of less than 3 years, you must complete a standard annual refresher course described in § 62.15935; and
                (b) For a lapse of 3 years or more, you must repeat the initial qualification requirements in § 62.15920.
              
              
                § 62.15945
                What if all the qualified operators are temporarily not accessible?

                If a qualified operator is not at the facility and cannot be at the facility within 1 hour, you must meet the criteria specified in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, depending on the length of time that a qualified operator is not accessible:
                
                (a) When a qualified operator is not accessible for more than 8 hours, the SSI unit may be operated for less than 2 weeks by other plant personnel who are familiar with the operation of the SSI unit and who have completed a review of the information specified in § 62.15950 within the past 12 months. However, you must record the period when a qualified operator was not accessible and include this deviation in the annual report as specified under § 62.16030(c).
                (b) When a qualified operator is not accessible for 2 weeks or more, you must take the two actions that are described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:
                (1) Notify the Administrator of this deviation in writing within 10 days. In the notice, state what caused this deviation, what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, and when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible; and
                (2) Submit a status report to the Administrator every 4 weeks outlining what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, stating when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible and requesting approval from the Administrator to continue operation of the SSI unit. You must submit the first status report 4 weeks after you notify the Administrator of the deviation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
                (i) If the Administrator notifies you that your request to continue operation of the SSI unit is disapproved, the SSI unit may continue operation for 30 days and then must cease operation; and
                (ii) Operation of the unit may resume if a qualified operator is accessible as required under § 62.15920(a). You must notify the Administrator within 5 days of having resumed operations and of having a qualified operator accessible.
              
              
                § 62.15950
                What site-specific documentation is required and how often must it be reviewed by qualified operators and plant personnel?
                (a) You must maintain at the facility the documentation of the operator training procedures specified under § 62.15920(c)(1) and make the documentation readily accessible to all SSI unit operators.
                (b) You must establish a program for reviewing the information listed in § 62.15920(c)(1) with each qualified incinerator operator and other plant personnel who may operate the unit according to the provisions of § 62.15945(a), according to the following schedule:
                (1) The initial review of the information listed in § 62.15920(c)(1) must be conducted by November 30, 2016, or prior to an employee's assumption of responsibilities for operation of the SSI unit, whichever date is later; and
                (2) Subsequent annual reviews of the information listed in § 62.15920(c)(1) must be conducted no later than 12 months following the previous review.

                § 62.15955
                What emission limits and standards must I meet and by when?

                You must meet the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart by the final compliance date specified in § 62.15875. The emission limits and standards apply at all times the unit is operating and during periods of malfunction. The emission limits and standards apply to emissions from a bypass stack or vent while sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time).
              
              
                § 62.15960
                What operating limits and requirements must I meet and by when?

                You must meet, as applicable, the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of this section, according to the schedule specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The operating parameters for which you will establish operating limits for a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator or activated carbon injection are listed in Table 4 to this subpart. You must comply with the operating requirements in paragraph (f) of this section and the requirements in paragraph (g) of this section for meeting any new operating limits, re-established in § 62.16005.

                (a) You must meet a site-specific operating limit for minimum operating temperature of the combustion chamber (or afterburner combustion chamber) that you establish in § 62.15985;
                (b) If you use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, activated carbon injection or afterburner to comply with an emission limit, you must meet the site-specific operating limits that you establish in § 62.15985 for each operating parameter associated with each air pollution control device;
                (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limits, you must install the bag leak detection system specified in §§ 62.15995(b) and 62.16020(b)(3)(i) and operate the bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5-percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. You must calculate the alarm time as specified in § 62.16005(a)(2)(i);
                (d) You must meet the operating requirements in your site-specific fugitive emission monitoring plan, submitted as specified in § 62.15995(d) to ensure that your ash handling system will meet the emission standard for fugitive emissions from ash handling;
                (e) You must meet the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section by the final compliance date specified in § 62.15875;
                (f) You must monitor the feed rate and moisture content of the sewage sludge fed to the sewage sludge incinerator, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section:
                (1) Continuously monitor the sewage sludge feed rate and calculate a daily average for all hours of operation during each 24-hour period. Keep a record of the daily average feed rate, as specified in § 62.16025(f)(3)(ii); and
                (2) Take at least one grab sample per day of the sewage sludge fed to the sewage sludge incinerator. If you take more than one grab sample in a day, calculate the daily average for the grab samples. Keep a record of the daily average moisture content, as specified in § 62.16025(f)(3)(ii).
                (g) For the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of this section, you must meet any new operating limits and requirements, re-established according to § 62.16005(d)); and
                (h) If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator or activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, you must meet any site-specific operating limits or requirements that you establish as required in § 62.15965.
              
              
                § 62.15965
                How do I establish operating limits if I do not use a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, activated carbon injection, or afterburner, or if I limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the emission limits?

                If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator, activated carbon injection, or afterburner, or limit emissions in some other manner (e.g., materials balance) to comply with the emission limits in § 62.15955, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
                (a) Meet the applicable operating limits and requirements in § 60.4850 of this chapter, and establish applicable operating limits according to § 62.15985; and
                (b) Petition the Administrator for specific operating parameters, operating limits, and averaging periods to be established during the initial performance test and to be monitored continuously thereafter.

                (1) You are responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. You must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has been approved by the Administrator, and you must comply with the operating limits as written, pending approval by the Administrator. Neither submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves you of the responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart;
                (2) Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section:
                (i) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to monitor;
                (ii) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants;
                (iii) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters that will establish the operating limits on these parameters, including a discussion of the averaging periods associated with those parameters for determining compliance;
                (iv) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments; and

                § 62.15970
                Do the emission limits, emission standards, and operating limits apply during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?

                The emission limits and standards apply at all times and during periods of malfunction. The operating limits apply at all times that sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (i.e., until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time). For determining compliance with the CO concentration limit using CO CEMS, the correction to 7-percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured CO concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other CO concentrations (corrected to 7-percent O2) to determine the 24-hour average value.

              Initial Compliance Requirements
              
                § 62.15980
                How and when do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you have the option to demonstrate initial compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead and fugitive emissions from ash handling. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 62.16015(a) and (b).
                (a) Demonstrate initial compliance using the performance test required in § 60.8 of this chapter. You must demonstrate that your SSI unit meets the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead and fugitive emissions from ash handling using the performance test. The initial performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements specified in § 62.16015(a).

                (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must demonstrate that your SSI unit meets the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart by the final compliance date (see Table 1 to this subpart).
                
                (2) You may use the results from a performance test conducted within the 2 previous years that was conducted under the same conditions and demonstrated compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, provided no process changes have been made since you conducted that performance test. However, you must continue to meet the operating limits established during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart. The performance test must have used the test methods specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.

                (b) Demonstrate initial compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead is published in the Federal Register. The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register. Collect data as specified in § 62.16015(b)(6) and use the following procedures:
                (1) To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the initial performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:
                (i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in lieu of conducting the initial performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section. For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7-percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7-percent oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.
                (ii) You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the annual mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (2) If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must use the continuous emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in § 62.16015(b). You must measure emissions according to § 60.13 of this chapter to calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7-percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide). You must demonstrate initial compliance using a 24-hour block average of these 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, calculated using Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (3) If you use a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must:
                (i) Use the continuous automated sampling system specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q) of this chapter, and measure and calculate average emissions corrected to 7-percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide) according to § 60.58b(p) and your monitoring plan.
                (A) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) of this chapter to calculate 24-hour block averages to determine compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.

                (B) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) of this chapter to calculate 2-week block averages to determine compliance with the dioxin/furan (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
                
                (ii) Comply with the provisions in § 60.58b(q) of this chapter to develop a monitoring plan. For mercury continuous automated sampling systems, you must use Performance Specification 12B of appendix B of part 75 of this chapter and Procedure 5 of appendix F of part 60 of this chapter.
                (4) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must complete your initial performance evaluations required under your monitoring plan for any continuous emissions monitoring systems and continuous automated sampling systems by the final compliance date (see Table 1 to this subpart). Your performance evaluation must be conducted using the procedures and acceptance criteria specified in § 62.15995(a)(3).
                (c) To demonstrate initial compliance with the dioxins/furans toxic equivalency emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency as follows:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octachlorinated-isomer emitted using EPA Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (2) Multiply the concentration of each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octa-chlorinated) isomer by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
                (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
                (d) Submit an initial compliance report, as specified in § 62.16030(b).
                (e) If you demonstrate initial compliance using the performance test specified in paragraph (a) of this section, then the provisions of this paragraph (e) apply. If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs or has occurred for which you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must notify the Administrator in writing as specified in § 62.16030(f). You must conduct the initial performance test as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs. The Administrator will determine whether or not to grant the extension to the initial performance test deadline and will notify you in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable. Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator, you remain strictly subject to the requirements of this subpart.
              
              
                § 62.15985

                (2) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point will be established. Use a bag leak detection system equipped with a system that will sound an alarm when the system detects an increase in relative particulate matter emissions over a preset level. The alarm must be located where it is observed readily and any alert is detected and recognized easily by plant operating personnel.

                (3) Evaluations of the performance of the bag leak detection system, performed in accordance with your monitoring plan and consistent with the guidance provided in OAQPS Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance, EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997.

                (c) You must conduct an initial performance evaluation of each continuous monitoring system and bag leak detection system, as applicable, in accordance with your monitoring plan and to § 60.13(c) of this chapter. For the purpose of this subpart, the provisions of § 60.13(c) also apply to the bag leak detection system. You must conduct the initial performance evaluation of each continuous monitoring system within 60 days of installation of the monitoring system
                (d) You must submit a monitoring plan specifying the ash handling system operating procedures that you will follow to ensure that you meet the fugitive emissions limit specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
                (e) You may submit an application to the Administrator for approval of alternate monitoring requirements to demonstrate compliance with the standards of this subpart, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (6) of this section.
                (1) The Administrator will not approve averaging periods other than those specified in this section, unless you document, using data or information, that the longer averaging period will ensure that emissions do not exceed levels achieved over the duration of three performance test runs.
                (2) If the application to use an alternate monitoring requirement is approved, you must continue to use the original monitoring requirement until approval is received to use another monitoring requirement.
                (3) You must submit the application for approval of alternate monitoring requirements no later than the notification of performance test. The application must contain the information specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section:

                (ii) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring requirement, including the operating parameter to be monitored, the monitoring approach and technique, the averaging period for the limit, and how the limit is to be calculated.
                (iii) Data or information documenting that the alternative monitoring requirement would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard.

                (4) The Administrator will notify you of the approval or denial of the application within 90 calendar days after receipt of the original request, or within 60 calendar days of the receipt of any supplementary information, whichever is later. The Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring application unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard. Before disapproving any alternate monitoring application, the Administrator will provide the following:
                
                (i) Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended disapproval is based.
                (ii) Notice of opportunity for you to present additional supporting information before final action is taken on the application. This notice will specify how much additional time is allowed for you to provide additional supporting information.
                (5) You are responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves you of the responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart.
                (6) The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case basis, that additional or alternative operating limits, or alternative approaches to establishing operating limits, are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.
                (f) You must submit your monitoring plans required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section at least 60 days before your initial performance evaluation of your continuous monitoring system(s).

              Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 62.16000
                How and when do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you have the option to demonstrate initial compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead and fugitive emissions from ash handling. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 62.16015(a) and (b). You may also petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
                (a) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a performance test. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (e) of this section, following the date that the initial performance test for each pollutant in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart is completed, you must conduct a performance test for each such pollutant on an annual basis (between 11 and 13 calendar months following the previous performance test). The performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring and calibration requirements specified in § 62.16015(a).
                (1) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits to apply from that point forward. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
                (2) You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process change, as defined in § 62.16045.
                (3) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, you can conduct performance tests less often for a given pollutant, as specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.

                (i) You can conduct performance tests less often if your performance tests for the pollutant for at least 2 consecutive years show that your emissions are at or below 75-percent of the emission limit specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, and there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions. In this case, you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year and no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
                (ii) If your SSI unit continues to meet the emission limit for the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year if your emissions are at or below 75-percent of the emission limit, and if there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions, but each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
                (iii) If a performance test shows emissions exceeded 75-percent of the emission limit for a pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over 2 consecutive years show compliance.

                (b) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead is published in the Federal Register
                  . The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register
                  . Collect data as specified in § 62.16015(b)(6) and use the following procedures:
                (1) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the annual performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:
                (i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in lieu of conducting the annual performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section. For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7-percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7-percent oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.
                (ii) You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the annual mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (2) If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must use the continuous emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in § 62.16015(b). You must measure emissions according to § 60.13 of this chapter to calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7-percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide). You must demonstrate initial compliance using a 24-hour block average of these 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, calculated using Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (3) If you use a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must:
                (i) Use the continuous automated sampling system specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q) of this chapter, and measure and calculate average emissions corrected to 7-percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide) according to § 60.58b(p) and your monitoring plan.
                (A) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) of this chapter to calculate 24-hour averages to determine compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.

                (B) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) of this chapter to calculate 2-week averages to determine compliance with the dioxin/furan (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
                (ii) Update your monitoring plan as specified in § 60.4880(e) of this chapter. For mercury continuous automated sampling systems, you must use Performance Specification 12B of appendix B of part 75 of this chapter and Procedure 5 of appendix F of part 60 of this chapter.
                (4) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must complete your periodic performance evaluations required in your monitoring plan for any continuous emissions monitoring systems and continuous automated sampling systems, according to the schedule specified in your monitoring plan. If you were previously determining compliance by conducting an annual performance test (or according to the less frequent testing for a pollutant as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), you must complete the initial performance evaluation required under your monitoring plan in § 62.15995 for the continuous monitoring system prior to using the continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance or continuous automated sampling system. Your performance evaluation must be conducted using the procedures and acceptance criteria specified in § 62.15995(a)(3).
                (c) To demonstrate compliance with the dioxins/furans toxic equivalency emission limit in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency as follows:
                (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octachlorinated-isomer emitted using Method 23 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
                (2) For each dioxin/furan (tetra- through octachlorinated) isomer measured in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, multiply the isomer concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
                (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
                (d) You must submit an annual compliance report as specified in § 62.16030(c). You must submit a deviation report as specified in § 62.16030(d) for each instance that you did not meet each emission limit in Tables 2 and 3 to this subpart.
                (e) If you demonstrate continuous compliance using a performance test, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, then the provisions of this paragraph (e) apply. If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must notify the Administrator in writing as specified in § 62.16030(f). You must conduct the performance test as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs. The Administrator will determine whether or not to grant the extension to the performance test deadline, and will notify you in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable. Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator, you remain strictly subject to the requirements of this subpart.
                (f) After any initial requests in § 62.15995 for alternative monitoring requirements for initial compliance, you may subsequently petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as specified in §§ 60.13(i) of this chapter and 62.15995(e).
              
              
                § 62.16005
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with my operating limits?
                You must continuously monitor your operating parameters as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, according to the monitoring and calibration requirements in § 62.16020. You must confirm and re-establish your operating limits as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

                (a) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section using the continuous monitoring equipment and according to the procedures specified in § 62.16020 or established in § 62.15965. To determine compliance, you must use the data averaging period specified in Table 4 to this subpart (except for alarm time of the baghouse leak detection system) unless a different averaging period is established under § 62.15965.
                (1) You must demonstrate that the SSI unit meets the operating limits established according to §§ 62.15965 and 62.15985 and paragraph (d) of this section for each applicable operating parameter.
                (2) You must demonstrate that the SSI unit meets the operating limit for bag leak detection systems as follows:
                (i) For a bag leak detection system, you must calculate the alarm time as follows:
                (A) If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted.
                (B) If corrective action is required, each alarm time shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour.

                (C) If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, each alarm time (i.e., time that the alarm sounds) is counted as the actual amount of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.
                (ii) Your maximum alarm time is equal to 5-percent of the operating time during a 6-month period, as specified in § 62.15960(c).
                (b) Operation above the established maximum, below the established minimum, or outside the allowable range of the operating limits specified in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes a deviation from your operating limits established under this subpart, except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission and operating limits or to establish new operating limits. You must submit the deviation report specified in § 62.16030(d) for each instance that you did not meet one of your operating limits established under this subpart.
                (c) You must submit the annual compliance report specified in § 62.16030(c) to demonstrate continuous compliance.
                (d) You must confirm your operating limits according to paragraph (d)(1) of this section or re-establish operating limits according to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Your operating limits must be established so as to assure ongoing compliance with the emission limits. These requirements also apply to your operating requirements in your fugitive emissions monitoring plan specified in § 62.15960(d).
                (1) Your operating limits must be based on operating data recorded during any performance test required in § 62.16000(a) or any performance evaluation required in § 62.16000(b)(4).
                (2) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits to apply from that point forward.
              
              
                § 62.16010

                (a) You must conduct an annual inspection of each air pollution control device used to comply with the emission limits, according to § 62.16015(c), no later than 12 months following the previous annual air pollution control device inspection.
                (b) Within 10 operating days following an air pollution control device inspection, all necessary repairs must be completed unless you obtain written approval from the Administrator establishing a date whereby all necessary repairs of the affected SSI unit must be completed.
              
            
            
              Performance Testing, Monitoring, and Calibration Requirements
              
                § 62.16015
                What are the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements for compliance with the emission limits and standards?
                You must meet, as applicable, the performance testing requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the air pollution control device inspections requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the bypass stack provisions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (a) Performance testing requirements. (1) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations, as specified in § 60.8(c) of this chapter. Emissions in excess of the emission limits or standards during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction are considered deviations from the applicable emission limits or standards.
                (2) You must document that the dry sludge burned during the performance test is representative of the sludge burned under normal operating conditions by:
                (i) Maintaining a log of the quantity of sewage sludge burned during the performance test by continuously monitoring and recording the average hourly rate that sewage sludge is fed to the incinerator.
                (ii) Maintaining a log of the moisture content of the sewage sludge burned during the performance test by taking grab samples of the sewage sludge fed to the incinerator for each 8 hour period that testing is conducted.
                (3) All performance tests must be conducted using the test methods, minimum sampling volume, observation period, and averaging method specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
                (4) Method 1 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, must be used to select the sampling location and number of traverse points.
                (5) Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, must be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, must be used simultaneously with each method.

                (6) All pollutant concentrations must be adjusted to 7-percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:
                
                
                  ER29AP16.025
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = Pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen.
                  Cmeas = Pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis.
                  (20.9 − 7) = 20.9 percent oxygen − 7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis).
                  20.9 = Oxygen concentration in air, percent.
                  %O2 = Oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
                
                
                (7) Performance tests must be conducted and data reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in this subpart unless the Administrator does one of the following.
                (i) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a method with minor changes in methodology.
                (ii) Approves the use of an equivalent method.
                (iii) Approves the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in compliance.
                (iv) Waives the requirement for performance tests because you have demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected SSI unit is in compliance with the standard.
                (v) Approves shorter sampling times and smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. Nothing in this paragraph (a)(7) is construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Clean Air Act.
                (8) You must provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days' notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, you must notify the Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.
                (9) You must provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:

                (i) Sampling ports adequate for the test methods applicable to the SSI unit, as follows:
                
                (A) Constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures.
                (B) Providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.
                (ii) Safe sampling platform(s).
                (iii) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
                (iv) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
                (10) Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each performance test must consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run must be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. Compliance with each emission limit must be determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the three runs. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond your control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.
                (11) During each test run specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must operate your sewage sludge incinerator at a minimum of 85-percent of your maximum permitted capacity.
                (b) Continuous monitor requirements. You must meet the following requirements, as applicable, when using a continuous monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead is published in the Federal Register. If you elect to use a continuous emissions monitoring system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section. If you elect to use a continuous automated sampling system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(7) of this section. The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the Federal Register.
                (1) You must notify the Administrator 1 month before starting use of the continuous emissions monitoring system.
                (2) You must notify the Administrator 1 month before stopping use of the continuous emissions monitoring system, in which case you must also conduct a performance test within prior to ceasing operation of the system.
                (3) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the emissions to the atmosphere in accordance with the following:
                (i) Section 60.13 of subpart A of part 60 of this chapter.

For sources that have actual inlet emissions less than 100 parts per million dry volume, the relative accuracy criterion for the inlet of the sulfur dioxide continuous emissions monitoring system should be no greater than 20-percent of the mean value of the method test data in terms of the units of the emission standard, or 5 parts per million dry volume absolute value of the mean difference between the method and the continuous emissions monitoring system, whichever is greater.
                (viii) For oxygen (or carbon dioxide as established in paragraph (b)(5) of this section), Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus], as applicable, must be used (see paragraph (e) of this section).

                (5) You may request that compliance with the emission limits be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7-percent oxygen. If carbon dioxide is selected for use in diluent corrections, the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels must be established during the initial performance test according to the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section. This relationship may be re-established during subsequent performance tests.
                
                (i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, must be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3A or 3B at 50 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus], as applicable, must be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor(see paragraph (e) of this section).

                (6) You must operate the continuous monitoring system and collect data with the continuous monitoring system as follows:
                (i) You must collect data using the continuous monitoring system at all times the affected SSI unit is operating and at the intervals specified in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions that occur during periods specified in § 62.15995(a)(7)(i), repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments). Any such periods that you do not collect data using the continuous monitoring system constitute a deviation from the monitoring requirements and must be reported in a deviation report.
                (ii) You must collect continuous emissions monitoring system data in accordance with § 60.13(e)(2) of this chapter.
                (iii) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities must not be included in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. Any such periods must be reported in a deviation report.
                (iv) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in § 60.4880(a)(7)(i) of this chapter, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities conducted during out-of-control periods must not be included in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. Any such periods that do not coincide with a monitoring system malfunction as defined in § 62.16045, constitute a deviation from the monitoring requirements and must be reported in a deviation report.
                (v) You must use all the data collected during all periods except those periods specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(iii) and (iv) of this section in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
                (7) If you elect to use a continuous automated sampling system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must:
                (i) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous automated sampling system according to the site-specific monitoring plan developed in § 60.58b(p)(1) through (6), (9), (10), and (q) of this chapter.
                (ii) Collect data according to § 60.58b(p)(5) of this chapter and paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
                (c) Air pollution control device inspections. You must conduct air pollution control device inspections that include, at a minimum, the following:
                (1) Inspect air pollution control device(s) for proper operation.
                (2) Generally observe that the equipment is maintained in good operating condition.
                (3) Develop a site-specific monitoring plan according to the requirements in § 62.15995. This requirement also applies to you if you petition the EPA Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters under § 60.13(i) of this chapter.
                (d) Bypass stack. Use of the bypass stack at any time that sewage sludge is being charged to the SSI unit is an emissions standards deviation for all pollutants listed in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart. The use of the bypass stack during a performance test invalidates the performance test.
                (e) Incorporation by reference. These standards are incorporated by reference into this section with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

              Title V—Operating Permits
              
                § 62.16035
                Am I required to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit for my existing SSI unit?
                Yes, if you are subject to an applicable EPA-approved and effective CAA section 111(d)/129 state or tribal plan or an applicable and effective federal plan, you are required to apply for and obtain a title V operating permit for your existing SSI unit unless you meet the relevant requirements for an exemption specified in § 62.15860.
              
              
                § 62.16040
                When must I submit a title V permit application for my existing SSI unit?
                (a) If your existing SSI unit is not subject to an earlier permit application deadline, a complete title V permit application must be submitted on or before the earlier of the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. (See sections 129(e), 503(c), 503(d), and 502(a) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(i) and 71.5(a)(1)(i)).

                (1) 12 months after the effective date of any applicable EPA-approved Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 state or tribal plan.
                (2) 12 months after the effective date of any applicable federal plan.
                (3) March 21, 2014.
                (b) For any existing unit not subject to an earlier permit application deadline, the application deadline of 36 months after the promulgation of 40 CFR part 60, subpart MMMM, applies regardless of whether or when any applicable federal plan is effective, or whether or when any applicable Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 state or tribal plan is approved by the EPA and becomes effective.
                (c) If your existing unit is subject to title V as a result of some triggering requirement(s) other than those specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section (for example, a unit may be a major source or part of a major source), then your unit may be required to apply for a title V permit prior to the deadlines specified in paragraphs (a) and (b). If more than one requirement triggers a source's obligation to apply for a title V permit, the 12-month time frame for filing a title V permit application is triggered by the requirement which first causes the source to be subject to title V. (See section 503(c) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.3(a) and (b), 70.5(a)(1)(i), 71.3(a) and (b), and 71.5(a)(1)(i).)
                (d) A “complete” title V permit application is one that has been determined or deemed complete by the relevant permitting authority under section 503(d) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.5(a)(2) or 71.5(a)(2). You must submit a complete permit application by the relevant application deadline in order to operate after this date in compliance with federal law. (See sections 503(d) and 502(a) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.7(b) and 71.7(b).)

                    1 As specified in § 62.15985, you may use a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system in lieu of establishing certain operating limits.
                  
                    2 This recording time refers to the minimum frequency that the continuous monitor or other measuring device initially records data. For all data recorded every 15 minutes, you must calculate hourly arithmetic averages. For all parameters, you use hourly averages to calculate the 12-hour or 3-hour block average specified in this table for demonstrating compliance. You maintain records of 1-hour averages.
