      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 52.1022
              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Maine's plan, as identified in § 52.1020, for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.
              (b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
              (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:

              (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; or

              (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; and,

              (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:
              

              (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e; or

              (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more.
              (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
              (i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
              (ii) The term tpy CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
              (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.

              (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO2e.

              (iii) the term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in 06-096 1. of Chapter 100 of Maine's Bureau of Air Quality Control regulations) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in 06-096, paragraphs 89 and 144 A of Chapter 100 of Maine's Bureau of Air Quality Control regulations) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO2e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO2e instead of applying the value in 06-096, paragraphs 143 and 144 D of Chapter 100 of Maine's Bureau of Air Quality Control regulations.

              § 52.1023
              Control strategy: Ozone.
              (a) Determination. EPA is determining that, as of July 21, 1995, the Lewiston-Auburn ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Lewiston-Auburn ozone nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
              (b) Determination. EPA is determining that, as of July 21, 1995, the Knox and Lincoln Counties ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Knox and Lincoln Counties ozone nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
              (c) Approval. EPA is approving an exemption request submitted by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection on September 7, 1995, for the Northern Maine area from the NOX requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts Oxford, Franklin, Somerset, Piscataquis, Penobscot, Washington, Aroostook, Hancock and Waldo Counties from the requirements to implement controls beyond those approved in § 52.1020(c)(41) for major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOX), nonattainment area new source review (NSR) for new sources and modifications that are major for NOX, and the applicable NOX-related requirements of the general and transportation conformity provisions.
              (d) Approval. EPA is approving an exemption request from the NOX requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act for northern Maine. The exemption request was submitted by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection on March 24, 2005, and supplemented on April 19 and June 28, 2005. This approval exempts major sources of nitrogen oxides in Aroostook, Franklin, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Washington, and portions of Hancock and Waldo Counties from the requirements to implement controls meeting reasonably available control technology under the Clean Air Act, and nonattainment area new source review (NSR) for new sources and modifications. In Waldo County, this area includes only the following towns: Belfast, Belmont, Brooks, Burnham, Frankfort, Freedom, Jackson, Knox, Liberty, Lincolnville, Monroe, Montville, Morrill, Northport, Palermo, Prospect, Searsmont, Searsport, Stockton Springs, Swanville, Thorndike, Troy, Unity, Waldo, and Winterport. In Hancock County, this area includes only the following towns and townships: Amherst, Aurora, Bucksport, Castine, Dedham, Eastbrook, Ellsworth, Franklin, Great Pond, Mariaville, Orland, Osborn, Otis, Penobscot, Verona, Waltham, Oqiton Township (T4 ND), T3 ND, T39 MD, T40 MD, T41 MD, T32 MD, T34 MD, T35 MD, T28 MD, T22 MD, T16 MD, T8 SD, T9 SD, T10 SD, and T7 SD.
              (e) Approval. EPA is approving a revision to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection on June 9 and 13, 2005. The revision is for purposes of satisfying the rate of progress requirements of section 182(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act for the Portland Maine one-hour ozone nonattainment area.
              (f) Approval. EPA is approving a revision to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection on June 9, 13, and 14, 2005. The revision is for purposes of satisfying the 5 percent increment of progress requirement of 40 CFR 51.905(a)(1)(ii)(B) for the Portland Maine eight-hour ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2007 of 20.115 tons per summer day (tpsd) of volatile organic compound (VOC) and 39.893 tpsd of nitrogen oxide (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity in the Portland Maine 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.

              (g) Approval. EPA is approving a redesignation request for the Portland, Maine 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. Maine submitted this request on August 3, 2006. The request contains the required Clean Air Act Section 175A maintenance plan. The plan establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2016 of 16.659 tons per summer day (tpsd) of volatile organic compound and 32.837 tpsd of nitrogen oxide (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity determinations in the Portland area.

              (h) Approval. EPA is approving a redesignation request for the Hancock, Knox, Lincoln and Waldo Counties, Maine 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. Maine submitted this request on August 3, 2006. The request contains the required Clean Air Act Section 175A maintenance plan. The plan establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2016 of 3.763 tons per summer day (tpsd) of volatile organic compound and 6.245 tpsd of nitrogen oxide (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity determinations in the Hancock, Knox, Lincoln and Waldo Counties area.
              (i) Approval: EPA is approving the 110(a)(1) 8-hour ozone maintenance plans in the four areas of the state required to have a 110(a)(1) maintenance plan for the 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. These areas are as follows: portions of York and Cumberland Counties; portions of Androscoggin County and all of Kennebec County; portions of Knox and Lincoln Counties; and portions of Hancock and Waldo Counties. These maintenance plans were submitted to EPA on August 3, 2006.
              (j) Approval. EPA is approving an exemption request from the nitrogen oxides (NOx) requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act for the entire state of Maine for purposes of the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. The exemption request was submitted by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection on October 13, 2012. This approval exempts, for purposes of the 2008 ozone standard, major sources of nitrogen oxides in Maine from:

              (1) The requirement to implement controls meeting reasonably available control technology (RACT) for NOX; and

              (2) Nonattainment area new source review requirements for major new and modified sources as they apply to emissions of NOX.

              (n) EPA approves revisions to the Maryland State Implementation Plan for Post-1996 Rate of Progress (ROP) Plans for the Baltimore severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions were submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on December 23, 2003 and consist of the following:

              (1) Revisions to the base year 1990 emissions inventory which reflect the use of the MOBILE6 motor vehicle emissions model. These revisions establish motor vehicle emissions inventories for 1990 of 165.14 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 228.21 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen (NOX).

              (2) Revisions to the year 2005 motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for transportation conformity purposes, reflecting the use of the MOBILE6 motor vehicle emissions model. These revisions establish a motor vehicle emissions budget of 55 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 144.5 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen (NOX). EPA approved new 2005 MOBILE6-based MVEBs for the Baltimore area's 1-hour ozone attainment demonstration on October 27, 2003 (68 FR 61106). Those MVEBs became effective on November 26, 2003. The approved 2005 attainment plan MVEBs budgets are 55.3 tons per day of VOC and 146.9 tons per day of NOX. The MVEBs of the 2005 ROP plan are less than the MVEBs in the approved attainment demonstration. These more restrictive MVEBs, contained in the ROP plan, are the applicable MVEBs to be used in transportation conformity demonstrations for the year 2005 for the Baltimore area.

              (3) Revisions to the 2005 ROP plan to reallocate some of the contingency measures established in prior SIP revisions to the control measures portion of the plan. EPA guidance allows states an additional year to adopt new contingency measures to replace those reallocated to the control measures portion of the plan. The State of Maryland's December 23, 2003 SIP revision submittal includes an enforceable commitment to replace those contingency measures reallocated to the control measures portion of the 2005 ROP plan and to submit these additional contingency measures by October 31, 2004.
              (o) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2003 to 2005, EPA has determined that the Washington, DC severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined that the Washington, DC severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the imposition of the section 185 penalty fees.
              (p) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2003 to 2005, EPA has determined that that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the imposition of the section 185 penalty fees.

              (ee) EPA approves the maintenance plan for the Maryland portion of the Washington, DC-MD-VA nonattainment area for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on February 5, 2018. The maintenance plan includes 2014, 2025, and 2030 motor vehicle emission budgets (MVEBs) for VOC and NOX to be applied to all future transportation conformity determinations and analyses for the entire Washington, DC-MD-VA area for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS. The maintenance plan includes two sets of VOC and NOX MVEBs: The MVEBs without transportation buffers are effective as EPA has determined them adequate for transportation conformity purposes; the MVEBs with transportation buffers will be used only as needed in situations where the conformity analysis must be based on different data, models, or planning assumptions, including, but not limited to, updates to demographic, land use, or project-related assumptions, than were used to create the set of MVEBs without transportation buffers. The technical analyses used to demonstrate compliance with the MVEBs and the need, if any, to use transportation buffers will be fully documented in the conformity analysis and follow the Transportation Planning Board's (TPB) interagency consultation procedures.

Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 179(c) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Martinsburg-Hagerstown, WV-MD nonattainment area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).
              (c) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2007 to 2009, Washington, DC-MD-VA moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Washington, DC-MD-VA moderate nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date pursuant to section 181(b)(2)(A).
              (d) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2008 to 2010, EPA determined that Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area (the Philadelphia Area) attained the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Philadelphia Area nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

              (e) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2007 to 2009, EPA determined that the PM2.5 nonattainment area of Baltimore, Maryland attained the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of April 5, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 179(c) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the NAAQS. EPA has also determined that the PM2.5 nonattainment area of Baltimore, Maryland is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).
              (f) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2003 to 2005, EPA determined, as of July 12, 2012, that the Baltimore 1-hour ozone nonattainment area did not attain the 1-hour ozone standard as of its applicable 1-hour ozone attainment date of November 15, 2005.
              (g) Based on 2009-2011 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the Baltimore 1-hour ozone nonattainment area, EPA determined, as of July 12, 2012, that the Baltimore 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard.
              (h) EPA has determined, as of May 26, 2015, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Baltimore nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1118, suspends the requirement for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
              (i) EPA has determined, as of June 1, 2015, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Baltimore nonattainment area has attained the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

              § 52.1123
              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart the Administrator approves the Massachusetts plan as identified in § 52.1120 for attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan identified in § 52.1120 satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D of the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sourceovered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
              (b) The above requirements for continued satisfaction of Part D are fulfilled by Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17) and a narrative commitment to review CTG IIIs issued in the future. Both were submitted on September 9, 1982. Additionally, each individual RACT determination made under 310 CMR 7.18(17) will be submitted as a SIP revision to incorporate the limitation into the SIP, and DEQE will propose regulations for CTG III category controls if the controls are appropriate for the State.

              § 52.1124
              Review of new sources and modifications.
              (a) Revisions to Regulation 310 CMR 7.02(2)(d) submitted on March 30, 1979 are disapproved because they do not satisfy the requirements of § 51.161.

              § 52.1125
              Emission inventories.
              (a) The Governor's designee for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts submitted the 1990 base year emission inventories for the Springfield nonattainment area and the Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester ozone nonattainment area on November 13, 1992 as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). Revisions to the inventories were submitted on November 15, 1993, and November 15, 1994, and March 31, 1997. The 1990 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for these areas.
              (b) The inventories are for the ozone precursors which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventories covers point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources.
              (c) Taken together, the Springfield nonattainment area and the Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester nonattainment area encompass the entire geographic area of the State. Both areas are classified as serious ozone nonattainment areas.
              (d) The state of Massachusetts submitted base year emission inventories representing emissions for calendar year 2002 from the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area and the Springfield moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area on January 31, 2008 as revisions to the State's SIP. The 2002 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for these areas. The inventories consist of emission estimates of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, and cover point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile and biogenic sources. The inventories were submitted as revisions to the SIP in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 1997 8-hour ozone standard.

              (e) The Commonwealth of Massachusetts submitted base year emission inventories representing emissions for calendar year 2011 for the Dukes county marginal 8-hour ozone nonattainment area on February 9, 2018, as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP. The 2011 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for this area. The inventory consists of emission estimates of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, and applies to point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile and biogenic sources. The inventories were submitted as revisions to the Massachusetts SIP in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 2008 8-hour ozone standard.

              (a) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on April 1, 1999, and supplemented on June 25, 1999 and September 9, 1999. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirements of sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act for the Springfield, Massachusetts serious ozone nonattainment area.

              (b) Approval—Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on July 27, 1998, October 1, 1998 and August 13, 1999. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, for the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes an attainment date of December 31, 2003 for the Springfield, Massachusetts serious ozone nonattainment area. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2003 of 23.77 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 49.11 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity in the Springfield, Massachusetts serious ozone nonattainment area.
              (c) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on April 10, 2002 and amended on July 26, 2002. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirements of sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act for the Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester serious ozone nonattainment area.
              (d) Approval—Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental protection on July 27, 1998, and September 6, 2002. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the one-hour ozone attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)92)(A) pof the Clean Air Act, for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattiainment area. The revision establishes a one-hour attainment date of November 15, 2007l, for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2007 of 86.7 tons per day of volatile organic compounds and 226.363 tons per day of nitrogen oxides to be used in transportation conformity in the Massachusets portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area.

              (e) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective May 30, 2012, EPA is determining that the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of December 31, 2003, based on 2001-2003 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, based on 2007-2009 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. EPA's review of the ozone data shows that the area began attaining the one-hour ozone standard during the 2007-2009 monitoring period, and has continued attaining the one-hour standard through the 2008-2010 and 2009-2011 monitoring periods.
              (f) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective June 28, 2012, EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area.
              (g) Determination of Attainment. (1) Determination of Attainment by Attainment Date; and
              (2) Determination of Attainment. Effective June 28, 2012.
              (i) Determination of Attainment by the Area's Attainment Date. EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA eight-hour ozone nonattainment area met the applicable June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.
              (ii) EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA eight-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area continues to attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. If EPA determines, after notice-and comment rulemaking, that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA area no longer meets the 1997 ozone NAAQS, this determination shall be withdrawn.
              (h) Determinations of Attainment: Effective July 19, 2012.
              (1) Determination of Attainment. EPA is determining that the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area continues to attain the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If EPA determines, after notice-and comment rulemaking, that the Western Massachusetts area no longer meets the 1997 ozone NAAQS, this determination shall be withdrawn.
              (2) Determination of Attainment by the Area's Attainment Date. EPA has determined that the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area met the applicable June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.

              (i) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on January 31, 2008. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b)(1) from 2002 through 2008, and the contingency measure requirement of sections 172(c)(9) and of the Clean Air Act, for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester (E. MA) moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, and the Springfield (W. MA) moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions establish motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 of 68.30 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 191.30 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity in the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester (E. MA) moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions also establish motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 for the Springfield (W. MA) moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area of 11.80 tons per day for VOCs, and 31.30 tons per day for NOX.
              (j) Approval—Reasonably Available Control Technology Demonstration for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on January 31, 2008. The revision consists of the state's certification that with regard to the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, Reasonably Available Control Technology controls have been implemented for all sources in the state covered by EPA's Control Techniques Guidelines (CTG) and for all major sources of volatile organic compound and nitrogen oxide emissions. The submittal also includes negative declaration for several CTG categories.
              (k) Determination of attainment for the eight-hour ozone standard. Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012 to 2014 show the Dukes County, Massachusetts eight-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard by its July 20, 2015 attainment deadline. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Dukes County nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
              (l) On February 9, 2018, Massachusetts submitted a certification that its air emissions reporting requirements applicable to stationary sources meet the emission statement requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act. The certification was submitted as a SIP revision in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 2008 8-hour ozone standard.

              § 52.1132
              Control strategy: Carbon Monoxide.
              (a) Approval—On November 13, 1992, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection submitted a revision to the carbon monoxide State Implementation Plan for the 1990 base year emission inventory. The inventory was submitted by the State of Massachusetts to satisfy Federal requirements under section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, as a revision to the carbon monoxide State Implementation Plan.

              (b) Approval—On December 12, 1994, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection submitted a request to redesignate the Boston Area carbon monoxide nonattainment area to attainment for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1993 attainment year) emission inventory for carbon monoxide, a demonstration of maintenance of the carbon monoxide NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2010 for carbon monoxide, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the carbon monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Massachusetts will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program and implementation of the oxygenated fuels program. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Massachusetts Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned area.
              (c) Approval—On May 25, 2001, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection submitted a revision to the carbon monoxide State Implementation Plan for the 1996 base year emission inventory. The inventory was submitted by the State of Massachusetts to satisfy Federal requirements under section 172(c) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, as a revision to the carbon monoxide State Implementation Plan.
              (d) Approval—On May 25, 2001, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) submitted a request to redesignate the cities of Lowell, Springfield, Waltham, and Worcester from nonattainment area to attainment for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a 1996 emission inventory for carbon monoxide, a demonstration of maintenance of the carbon monoxide NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2012 for carbon monoxide, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If an area records an exceedance or violation of the carbon monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the MADEP), Massachusetts will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively.
              (e) Approval—On April 14, 2010, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection submitted a modification to the Lowell maintenance plan approved in paragraph (c) of this section. Massachusetts will not conduct CO monitoring in Lowell, but instead commits to continue to collect and review CO monitoring data from nearby Worcester, MA on an on-going basis. In the event the second highest CO concentration in any calendar year monitored in Worcester reaches 75 percent of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour national ambient air quality standard for CO, Massachusetts will, within 9 months of recording such concentrations, re-establish a CO monitoring site in Lowell consistent with EPA citing criteria, and resume analyzing and reporting those data. Massachusetts commits to implement its contingency program in Lowell in the event that a CO violation is monitored at the re-established Lowell monitoring site at any time during the maintenance period. If the Worcester CO monitor measures a violation of either the federal 1-hour or 8-hour NAAQS for CO, contingency measures will be implemented in Lowell as well, until a re-established CO monitor in Lowell shows that the area is in attainment of the CO standard.

              (3) Vehicles owned and operated by handicapped persons with HP license plates; and
              (4) Vehicles registered as “commercial vehicles” by the Commonwealth and displaying appropriate license plates.
              (d) On or before June 30, 1974, no owner or operator of a motor vehicle shall park, or permit the on-street parking of, said vehicle within Cambridge or Boston proper except in conformity with the provisions of this section and the measures implementing it.
              (e) The Governor and the chief executive of any other governmental entity on which obligations are imposed by paragraph (b) of this section should, on or before April 15, 1974, submit to the Regional Administrator for his approval a detailed statement of the legal and administrative steps selected to effect the prohibition provided for in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, and a schedule of implementation consistent with the requirements of this section. Such schedule shall include as a minimum the following:
              (1) Designation of one or more agencies responsible for the administration and enforcement of the program;
              (2) The procedures by which the designated agency will enforce the prohibition provided for in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section;
              (3) The procedures by which vehicles exempt from the requirements of this section will be marked; and
              (4) A map showing which streets will be subject to the ban according to the schedule of implementation.

              (f) Upon a finding that substantial hardship would otherwise be experienced by employees of employment facilities located in Cambridge, the Director of Traffic and Parking of the City of Cambridge may issue special parking stickers to such employees which shall entitle vehicles to park during the hours of the ban. Such stickers shall be valid only for those streets and areas of streets clearly identified on the face of such stickers, shall be issued with preference being given to carpools and vanpools and shall be subject to immediate revocation if the vehicle is cited for a parking violation on a street or area other than those designated. A list of all persons receiving such stickers shall be sent to the Regional Administrator on or before July 1 of each year.
              (g) The ban shall not apply to any street space which is subject to metered parking with a maximum allowable time limit of one hour.

              § 52.1135
              Regulation for parking freeze.
              (a) Definitions:
              (1) The phrase to commence construction means to engage in a continuous program of on-site construction including site clearance, grading, dredging, or land filling specifically designed for a parking facility in preparation for the fabrication, erection, or installation of the building components of the facility. For the purpose of this paragraph, interruptions resulting from acts of God, strikes, litigation, or other matters beyond the control of the owner shall be disregarded in determining whether a construction or modification program is continuous.
              (2) The phrase to commence modification means to engage in a continuous program of on-site modification including site clearance, grading, dredging, or land filling in preparation for a specific modification of the parking facility.
              (3) The phrase commercial parking space means a space used for parking a vehicle in a commercial parking facility.
              (4) [Reserved]
              (5) Commercial parking facility (also called facility) means any lot, garage, building or structure, or combination or portion thereof, on or in which motor vehicles are temporarily parked for a fee, excluding (i) a parking facility, the use of which is limited exclusively to residents (and guests of residents) of a residential building or group of buildings under common control, and (ii) parking on public streets.
              (6) Freeze means to maintain at all times after October 15, 1973, the total quantity of commercial parking spaces available for use at the same amounts as were available for use prior to said date; Provided, That such quantity may be increased by spaces the construction of which commenced prior to October 15, 1973, or as specifically permitted by paragraphs (n), (p) and (q) of this section; provided further that such additional spaces do not result in an increase of more than 10 percent in the total commercial parking spaces available for use on October 15, 1973, in any municipality within the freeze area or at Logan International Airport (“Logan Airport”). For purposes of the last clause of the previous sentence, the 10 percent limit shall apply to each municipality and Logan Airport separately.
              (b) [Reserved]
              (c) There is hereby established a freeze, as defined by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, on the availability of commercial parking facilities in the freeze area effective October 15, 1973. In the event construction in any municipality, commenced prior to October 15, 1973, results in a number of spaces which exceeds the 10 percent limit prescribed by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the Governor shall immediately take all necessary steps to assure that the available commercial spaces within such municipality shall be reduced to comply with the freeze. In the event that such limit is exceeded at Logan Airport, then the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section shall apply.
              (d) [Reserved]
              (e) After August 15, 1973, no person shall commence construction of any commercial parking facility or modification of any such existing facility in the freeze area unless and until he has obtained from the Governor or from an agency approved by the Governor a permit stating that construction or modification of such facility will be in compliance with the parking freeze established by paragraph (c) of this section. This paragraph shall not apply to any proposed parking facility for which a general construction contract was finally executed by all appropriate parties on or before August 15, 1973.

              (f) The Governor shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing within 10 days of approval of any agency pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. In order for any agency to be approved by the Governor for purposes of issuing permits pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, such agency shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Governor that:
              (1) Requirements for permit application and issuance have been established. Such requirements shall include but not be limited to a condition that before a permit may be issued the following findings of fact or factually supported projections must be made:
              (i) The location of the facility; and
              (ii) The total motor vehicle capacity before and after the proposed construction or modification of the facility.
              (2) Criteria for issuance of permits have been established and published. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to:
              (i) Full consideration of all facts contained in the application.
              (ii) Provisions that no permit will be issued if construction or modification of the facility will not comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
              (3) Agency procedures provide that no permit for the construction or modification of a facility covered by this section shall be issued without notice and opportunity for public hearing. The public hearing may be of a legislative type; the notice shall conform to the requirements of 40 CFR 51.4(b); and the agency rules or procedures may provide that if no notice of intent to participate in the hearing is received from any member of the public (other than the applicant) prior to 7 days before the scheduled hearing date, no hearing need be held. If notice of intent to participate is required, the fact shall be noted prominently in the required hearing notice.
              (g)-(l) [Reserved]
              (m) On or before January 30, 1975, the Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) shall prepare and submit to the Governor for his approval a plan showing the manner in which the number of commercial parking spaces at Logan Airport which exceeds the number of such spaces permitted under the freeze shall be removed from use. The Governor shall approve such plan if he determines that (1) implementation of such plan would result in reducing the aggregate number of commercial parking spaces to the level of such spaces permitted by this section, (2) Massport has adequate legal authority to implement such plan and (3) adequate commitments have been made by Massport to assure the Governor that such plan will be fully implemented and maintained on and after May 1, 1976. In the event that the Governor does not approve such plan by April 1, 1976, then the owner or operator of each commercial parking facility located at Logan Airport shall, on or before July 1, 1976, reduce the number of commercial parking spaces available for use at each such facility by an amount which bears the same proportion to the number of spaces exceeding the limit imposed by this section as the number of spaces available at such facility bears the total number of such spaces which were available for use at Logan Airport on April 1, 1976.
              (n) Where an agency approved by the Governor under paragraph (e) of this section to issue permits for new construction in the City of Cambridge demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Governor that (1) specific on-street parking spaces in use as of October 15, 1973, were being legally and regularly used as of such date for parking by commuters (as that term is defined in § 52.1161(a)(6)) who are not residents of Cambridge and that (2) effective measures have been implemented (including adequate enforcement) to prevent such spaces from being used by such commuters, then such approved agency may issue permits for construction of additional new commercial parking spaces equal to one-half of the number of spaces removed from regular use by such commuters and the total quantity of commercial parking spaces allowable in Cambridge under this section shall be raised accordingly.
              (o) On or before July 31, 1976, and on or before each succeeding July 31, the Governor and the chief executive officer of any agency approved by the Governor under paragraph (e) of this section shall submit a report to the Regional Administrator setting forth:

              (1) The names and addresses of all persons who received permits during the previous twelve-month period ending June 30 and number of spaces allocated to each such person;
              (2) The number of commercial parking spaces available for use as of the June 30 prior to the date of the report;
              (3) The number of commercial parking spaces which remain available for allocation by the Governor or such agency as of the June 30 prior to the date of the report, including those spaces made available because of retirement of existing commercial parking spaces as well as those spaces made available because of the effects of paragraphs (n), (p) and (q) of this section; and
              (4) The location and capacity of any park-and-ride facility designated under paragraph (p) of this section.
              (p) The Governor and any approved agency may issue a permit to construct a commercial parking facility which is designated by the Governor as a park-and-ride facility to be operated in conjunction with mass transit service without regard to the limitations on number of spaces imposed by this section.
              (q) Where an agency approved by the Governor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Governor that there have been physically eliminated through permanent modification or demolition any legal on-street parking spaces within a municipality then such agency may issue permits for construction within that municipality of additional new commercial parking spaces equal to the number of spaces thus eliminated and the total quantity of commercial parking spaces allowable for such municipality under this section shall be increased accordingly.
              (r) The provisions of this regulation shall cease to be effective as to that portion of the freeze area lying within the City of Boston and not included within Boston proper or Logan Airport at such time as the City of Boston implements a program, approved by the Governor, which shall include effective measures to control the construction of additional commercial parking spaces within that area, including procedures for issuance of conditional use permits under applicable zoning regulations and for assuring compliance with all air quality requirements under state and Federal law.

              (a) Not later than October 1, 1975, the Commonwealth shall have developed and have begun to implement a program to identify urban and suburban core areas and roadway/intersection complexes within the Boston Intrastate Region which violate the national ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide. Once such localized areas have been identified, the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the affected local municipalities, shall develop and implement appropriate control strategies to insure that such air quality standards will be achieved at such areas. Plans shall be developed to include provisions for the entire municipality in order to insure that the implemented strategies will not create carbon monoxide violations elsewhere in the vicinity after the measures have been applied.
              (b) To accomplish the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the Commonwealth shall do the following:
              (1) Identify areas of potentially high carbon monoxide concentrations by reviewing all available traffic data, physical site data and air quality and meteorological data for all major intersections and roadway complexes within the Region. The Regional Administrator will provide general guidance on area designations to assist in the initial identification process.
              (2) Areas identified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be studied in further detail, including meteorological modeling, traffic flow monitoring, air quality monitoring and other measures necessary to accurately quantify the extent and actual levels of carbon monoxide in the area. A report containing the results of these analyses and identifying such areas shall be submitted to the Regional Administrator no later than March 1, 1976.
              (3) If, after the completion of actions required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an area shows or is predicted to have violations of the carbon monoxide standard, the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the affected municipality, shall submit a plan to the Regional Administrator containing measures to regulate traffic and parking so as to reduce carbon monoxide emissions to achieve air quality standards in the area. Such plan shall include: the name of the agency responsible for implementing the plan, all technical data and analyses supporting the conclusions of the plan, all control strategies adopted as part of the plan, and other such information relating to the proposed program as may be required by the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator shall provide general guidance on applicable control strategies and reporting formats to assist in plan development and submittal. Such a plan shall be submitted for each municipality which contains one or more identified areas no later than October 1, 1975 for Waltham and October 1, 1976, for other areas.
              (4) All measures called for in the plan submitted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be subject to the approval of the Regional Administrator and shall be implemented by May 31, 1977.
              (c) The Commonwealth shall annually review the effectiveness of the control strategies developed pursuant to this section and modify them as necessary to insure that such carbon monoxide standards will be attained and maintained. The results of this review and any changes in the measures which the Commonwealth recommends as a result thereof shall be reported to the Regional Administrator annually as required under § 52.1160.
              (d) Prior to submitting any plan to the Regional Administrator under paragraph (b)(3), the Commonwealth shall give prominent public notice of the general recommendations of such plan, shall make such plan available to the public for at least 30 days and permit any affected public agency or member of the public to comment in writing on such plan. The Commonwealth shall give the Regional Administrator timely notice of any public hearing to be held on such plan and shall make all comments received available to the Regional Administrator for inspection and copying.

              (114) The Commonwealth of Massachusetts' March 27, 1996 submittal for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as amended on June 27, 1996 and July 29, 1996, and November 1, 1996, is conditionally approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim period to last eighteen months. If the Commonwealth fails to start its program according to schedule, or by November 15, 1997 at the latest, this conditional approval will convert to a disapproval after EPA sends a letter to the state. If the Commonwealth fails to satisfy the following conditions within 12 months of this rulemaking, this conditional approval will automatically convert to a disapproval as explained under section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act.
              (i) The conditions for approvability are as follows:
              (A) The time extension program as described and committed to in the March 3, 1997 letter from Massachusetts must be further defined and submitted to EPA as a SIP revision by no later than one year after the effective date of this interim approval. Another program which meets the requirements of 40 CFR 51.360 (Waivers and Compliance via Diagnostic Inspection) and provides for no more than a 1% waiver rate would also be approvable.
              (B) Other major deficiencies as described in the proposal must also be corrected in 40 CFR 51.351 (Enhanced I/M Performance Standard), § 51.354 (Adequate Tools and Resources), § 51.357 (Test Procedures and Standards), § 51.359 (Quality Control), and § 51.363 (Quality Assurance). The Commonwealth, committed in a letter dated March 3, 1997 to correct these deficiencies within one year of conditional interim approval by EPA.
              (ii) In addition to the above conditions for approval, the Commonwealth must correct several minor, or de minimis deficiencies related to CAA requirements for enhanced I/M. Although satisfaction of these deficiencies does not affect the conditional approval status of the Commonwealth's rulemaking granted under the authority of section 110 of the Clean Air Act, these deficiencies must be corrected in the final I/M SIP revision prior to the end of the 18-month interim period granted under the National Highway Safety Designation Act of 1995:
              (A) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the program evaluation element as required under 40 CFR 51.353;
              (B) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the test frequency and convenience element required under 40 CFR 51.355;
              (C) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the number and types of vehicles included in the program as required under 40 CFR 51.356;
              (D) The SIP lacks a detailed information concerning the enforcement process, and a commitment to a compliance rate to be maintained in practice required under 40 CFR 51.361.
              (E) The SIP lacks the details of the enforcement oversight program including quality control and quality assurance procedures to be used to insure the effective overall performance of the enforcement system as required under 40 CFR 51.362;
              (F) The SIP lacks a detailed description of procedures for enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors as required under 40 CFR 51.364;
              (G) The SIP lacks a detailed description of data analysis and reporting provisions as required under 40 CFR 51.366;
              (H) The SIP lacks a public awareness plan as required by 40 CFR 51.368; and
              (I) The SIP lacks provisions for notifying motorists of required recalls prior to inspection of the vehicle as required by 40 CFR 51.370.
              (iii) EPA is also approving this SIP revision under section 110(k), for its strengthening effect on the plan.

              Part D—Disapproval of Rules and Regulations.

              On December 30, 1985, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) submitted a revision to the Massachusetts State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the automobile surface coating regulation. This revision requested an extension of the final compliance dates to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) on topcoat and final repair applications. As a result of EPA's disapproval of this revision, the existing compliance date of December 31, 1985 specified in the automobile surface coating regulation contained in the Massachusetts SIP will remain in effect (Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(7) as approved by EPA and codified at 40 CFR 52.1120(c)(30) and (53)).

              Stack height review.

              The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has declared to the satisfaction of EPA that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height credits greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited dispersion technique as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as revised on July 8, 1985. This declaration was submitted to EPA on April 8, 1986. The commonwealth has further declared in a letter from Bruce K. Maillet, dated June 24, 1986, that, “[A]s part of our new source review activities under the Massachusetts SIP and our delegated PSD authority, the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering will follow EPA's stack height regulations, as revised in the Federal Register on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892).” Thus, the Commonwealth has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

              Approval status.

              With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Michigan's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittalof RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.

EPA disapproves this revision, because it does not satisfy all the requirements of EPA's proposed Emission Trading Policy Statement of April 7, 1982 (47 FR 15076).

              (d) Approval—On April 29, 1988, the State of Michigan submitted a committal SIP for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometers (PM10) for Michigan's Group II areas. The Group II areas of concern are in the City of Monroe and an area surrounding the City of Carrollton. The committal SIP contains all the requirements identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP requirements for PM10 at 52 FR 24681.
              (e) [Reserved]
              (f) On July 24, 1995, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested the redesignation of Wayne County to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter. The State's maintenance plan is complete and the redesignation satisfies all of the requirements of the Act.
              (g) Approval—On November 29, 1994, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the particulate State Implementation Plan for general conformity rules. The general conformity SIP revisions enable the State of Michigan to implement and enforce the Federal general conformity requirements in the nonattainment or maintenance areas at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 93, subpart B—Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans.
              (h) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, as of November 6, 2012, that based on 2009-2011 ambient air quality data, the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area has attained the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS.

              (i) Pursuant to Clean Air Act section 179(c), EPA has determined that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area attained the annual 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date, April 5, 2010.

              (g) [Reserved]
              (h) Approval—On January 5, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for the 1990 base year emission inventory. The inventory was submitted by the State of Michigan to satisfy Federal requirements under section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, as a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor moderate ozone nonattainment area. This area includes Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties.

              (i) Approval—On November 12, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a request to redesignate the Detroit-Ann Arbor (consisting of Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties) ozone nonattainment area to attainment for ozone. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1993 attainment year) emission inventory for NOX and VOC, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories (including interim years) to the year 2005 for NOX and VOC, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the ozone NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. Appropriateness of a contingency measure will be determined by an urban airshed modeling analysis. The Governor or his designee will select the contingency measure(s) to be implemented based on the analysis and the MDNR's recommendation. The menu of contingency measures includes basic motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program upgrades, Stage I vapor recovery expansion, Stage II vapor recovery, intensified RACT for degreasing operations, NOX RACT, and RVP reduction to 7.8 psi. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Michigan Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned counties.
              (j) [Reserved]
              (k) Determination—USEPA is determining that, as of July 20, 1995, the Grand Rapids and Muskegon ozone nonattainment areas have attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the areas for so long as the areas do not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in either the Grand Rapids or Muskegon ozone nonattainment area, the determination shall no longer apply for the area that experiences the violation.

              (l) Approval—EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen (NOX) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general conformity exemptions for the Grand Rapids (Kent and Ottawa Counties) and Muskegon (Muskegon County) moderate nonattainment areas as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval also covers the exemption of NOX transportation and general conformity requirements of section 176(c) for the Counties of Allegan, Barry, Bay, Berrien, Branch, Calhoun, Cass, Clinton, Eaton, Gratiot, Genesee, Hillsdale, Ingham, Ionia, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lenawee, Midland, Montcalm, St. Joseph, Saginaw, Shiawasse, and Van Buren.

              (m) Approval—On November 24, 1994, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation and enforcement of the Federal transportation conformity requirements at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 51, subpart T—Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act.
              (n) Approval—On November 29, 1994, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for general conformity rules. The general conformity SIP revisions enable the State of Michigan to implement and enforce the Federal general conformity requirements in the nonattainment or maintenance areas at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 93, subpart B—Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans.

              (o) Approval—On March 9, 1996, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality submitted a request to redesignate the Grand Rapids ozone nonattainment area (consisting of Kent and Ottawa Counties) to attainment for ozone. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include an attainment emission inventory for NOX and VOC, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2007 for NOX and VOC, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and a commitment to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS, determined not to be attributable to transport from upwind areas, is monitored, Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained in the contingency plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is recorded, the State will notify EPA, review the data for quality assurance, and conduct a technical analysis, including an analysis of meteorological conditions leading up to and during the exceedances contributing to the violation, to determine local culpability. This preliminary analysis will be submitted to EPA and subjected to public review and comment. The State will solicit and consider EPA's technical advice and analysis before making a final determination on the cause of the violation. The Governor or his designee will select the contingency measure(s) to be implemented within 6 months of a monitored violation attributable to ozone and ozone precursors from the Grand Rapids area. The menu of contingency measures includes a motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, Stage II vapor recovery, RVP reduction to 7.8 psi, RACT on major non-CTG VOC sources in the categories of coating of plastics, coating of wood furniture, and industrial cleaning solvents. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Michigan Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned counties.
              (p) Approval—On November 22, 1995 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a petition for exemption from transportation conformity requirements for the Muskegon ozone nonattainment area. This approval exempts the Muskegon ozone nonattainment area from transportation conformity requirements under section 182(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. If a violation of the ozone standard occurs in the Muskegon County ozone nonattainment area, the exemption shall no longer apply.
              (q) Correction of approved plan—Michigan air quality Administrative Rule, R336.1901 (Rule 901)—Air Contaminant or Water Vapor, has been removed from the approved plan pursuant to section 110(k)(6) of the Clean Air Act (as amended in 1990).

              (r) Approval—On March 9, 1995, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality submitted a request to redesignate the Muskegon County ozone nonattainment area to attainment. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS, determined not to be attributable to transport from upwind areas, Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes a motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, stage II vapor recovery, a low Reid vapor pressure gasoline program, and rules for industrial cleanup solvents, plastic parts coating, and wood furniture coating.
              (s) Approval—On May 9, 2000, the State of Michigan submitted a revision to the Michigan State Implementation Plan for ozone containing a section 175A maintenance plan for the Flint and Saginaw-Midland-Bay City areas as part of Michigan's request to redesignate the areas from nonattainment to attainment for ozone. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If monitors in any of these areas record a violation of the ozone NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Michigan will adopt, submit to EPA, and implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are in the contingency plan and will submit a full maintenance plan under section 175A of the Clean Air Act. The menu of contingency measures includes a low Reid vapor pressure gasoline program, stage I gasoline vapor recovery, and rules for industrial cleanup solvents, plastic parts coating, and wood furniture coating.
              (t) Approval—On March 9, 1995, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality submitted a request to redesignate the Allegan County ozone nonattainment area to attainment. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS, determined not to be attributable to transport from upwind areas, Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes rules for plastic parts coating, wood furniture coating, and gasoline loading (Stage I vapor recovery).

              (u) Approval—On March 22, 2001, Michigan submitted a revision to the ozone maintenance plan for the Muskegon County area. The revision consists of allocating a portion of the Muskegon County area's Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) safety margin to the transportation conformity Motor Vehicle Emission Budget (MVEB). The MVEB for transportation conformity purposes for the Muskegon County area are now: 8.5 tons per day of VOC emissions and 10.2 tons per day of NOX emissions for the year 2010. This approval only changes the VOC and NOX transportation conformity MVEB for Muskegon County.

              (v) Approval—On December 19, 2003, Michigan submitted an update to the Section 175(A) maintenance plan for the Southeast Michigan 1-hour ozone maintenance area, which consists of Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties. This update addresses the second 10-year period of maintenance of the ozone standard in Southeast Michigan, which spans the years 2005 through 2015. The maintenance plan also revises the Motor Vehicle Emissions Budget (MVEB). For the year 2005, the MVEB for VOC is 218.1 tons per day (tpd), and the MVEB for NOX is 412.9 tpd. For the year 2015, the MVEB for VOC is 172.8 tpd, and the MVEB for NOX is 412.9 tpd.

              (w) Approval—On June 17, 2005, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality submitted a petition requesting the exemption from Clean Air Act oxides of nitrogen control requirements in six 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas. The Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo/Battle Creek, Lansing/East Lansing, Benzie County, Huron County, and Mason County nonattainment areas each receive an exemption. Section 182(f) of the 1990 amended Clean Air Act authorizes the exceptions. The exemption will no longer apply in an area if it experiences a violation of the 8-hour ozone standard.

              (x) Approval—On May 9, 2006, Michigan submitted requests to redesignate the Grand Rapids (Kent and Ottawa Counties), Kalamazoo-Battle Creek (Calhoun, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren Counties), Lansing-East Lansing (Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham Counties), Benzie County, Huron County, and Mason County areas to attainment of the 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The State supplemented its redesignation requests on May 26, 2006, and August 25, 2006. As part of its redesignation requests, the State submitted maintenance plans as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit subsequent maintenance plan revisions in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If monitors in any of these areas record a violation of the 8-hour ozone NAAQS, Michigan will adopt and implement one or more contingency measures. The list of possible contingency measures includes: Lower Reid vapor pressure gasoline requirements; reduced volatile organic compound (VOC) content in architectural, industrial, and maintenance coatings rule; auto body refinisher self-certification audit program; reduced VOC degreasing rule; transit improvements; diesel retrofit program; reduced VOC content in commercial and consumer products rule; and a program to reduce idling. Also included in the Michigan's submittal were motor vehicle emission budgets (MVEBs) for use to determine transportation conformity in the areas. For the Grand Rapids area, the 2018 MVEBs are 40.70 tpd for VOC and 97.87 tpd for oxides of nitrogen (NOX). For the Kalamazoo-Battle Creek area, the 2018 MVEBs are 29.67 tpd for VOC and 54.36 tpd for NOX. For the Lansing-East Lansing area, the 2018 MVEBs are 28.32 tpd for VOC and 53.07 tpd for NOX. For the Benzie County area, the 2018 MVEBs are 2.24 tpd for VOC and 1.99 tpd for NOX. For the Huron County area, the 2018 MVEBs are 2.34 tpd for VOC and 7.53 tpd for NOX. For the Mason County area, the 2018 MVEBs are 1.81 tpd for VOC and 2.99 tpd for NOX.

              (y) Approval—On June 13, 2006, Michigan submitted requests to redesignate the Flint (Genesee and Lapeer Counties), Muskegon (Muskegon County), Benton Harbor (Berrien County), and Cass County areas to attainment of the 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The State supplemented its redesignation requests on August 25, 2006, and November 30, 2006. As part of its redesignation requests, the State submitted maintenance plans as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit subsequent maintenance plan revisions in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If monitors in any of these areas record a violation of the 8-hour ozone NAAQS, Michigan will adopt and implement one or more contingency measures. The list of possible contingency measures includes: Lower Reid vapor pressure gasoline requirements; reduced volatile organic compound (VOC) content in architectural, industrial, and maintenance coatings rule; auto body refinisher self-certification audit program; reduced VOC degreasing rule; transit improvements; diesel retrofit program; reduced VOC content in commercial and consumer products rule; and a program to reduce idling. Also included in the Michigan's submittal were motor vehicle emission budgets (MVEBs) for use to determine transportation conformity in the areas. For the Flint area, the 2018 MVEBs are 25.68 tpd for VOC and 37.99 tpd for oxides of nitrogen (NOX). For the Muskegon area, the 2018 MVEBs are 6.67 tpd for VOC and 11.00 tpd for NOX. For the Benton Harbor area, the 2018 MVEBs are 9.16 tpd for VOC and 15.19 tpd for NOX. For the Cass County area, the 2018 MVEBs are 2.76 tpd for VOC and 3.40 tpd for NOX.

              (z) Approval—On March 6, 2009, Michigan submitted a request to redesignate the Detroit-Ann Arbor area (Lenawee, Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties) to attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). As part of its redesignation requests, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit subsequent maintenance plan revisions in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If monitors in any of these areas record a violation of the 8-hour ozone NAAQS, Michigan will adopt and implement one or more contingency measures. The list of possible contingency measures includes: Reduced VOC content in architectural, industrial, and maintenance (AIM) coatings rule; auto body refinisher self-certification audit program; reduced VOC degreasing/solvent cleaning rule; diesel retrofit program; reduced idling program; portable fuel container replacement rule; and, food preparation flame broiler control rule. Also included in the Michigan's submittal were a 2005 base year emissions inventory and motor vehicle emission budgets (MVEBs) for use to determine transportation conformity in the area. For the Detroit-Ann Arbor area, Michigan has established separate MVEBS for the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) region (Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties) and for Lenawee County. MDEQ has determined the 2020 MVEBs for the SEMCOG region to be 106 tons per day for VOC and 274 tpd for NOX. MDEQ has determined the 2020 MVEBs for Lenawee County to be 2.1 tpd for VOC and 4.4 tpd for NOX.

              Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.

              (a) Approval—On March 18, 1999, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality submitted a request to redesignate the Detroit CO nonattainment area (consisting of portions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties) to attainment for CO. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1996 attainment year) emission inventory for CO, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2010, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the CO NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes enforceable emission limitations for stationary sources, transportation control measures, or a vehicle inspection and maintenance program. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990.
              (b) Approval—On December 19, 2003, Michigan submitted a request to revise its plan for the Southeast Michigan CO maintenance area (consisting of portions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties). The submittal contains updated emission inventories for 1996 and 2010, and an update to the 2010 motor vehicle emissions budget (MVEB). The 2010 MVEB is 3,842.9 tons of CO per day.
              (c) Approval—On October 3, 2016, the State of Michigan submitted a revision to their Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plan. The submittal established transportation conformity “Conformity” criteria and procedures related to interagency consultation, and enforceability of certain transportation related control and mitigation measures.

Any remaining results through the end of the 57th month that do not fall within a calendar quarter must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days from the end of the 57th month. The pellet quality analyses shall include results for the following factors: Compression, reducibility, before tumble, after tumble, and low temperature disintegration. For each of the pellet quality analysis factors the owner or operator must explain the pellet quality analysis factor as well as the defined acceptable range for each factor using the applicable product quality standards based upon customers' pellet specifications that are contained in Tilden's ISO 9001 quality management system. The owner or operator shall provide pellet quality analysis testing results that state the date and time of the analysis and, in order to define the time period when pellets were produced outside of the defined acceptable range for the pellet quality factors listed, provide copies of the production logs that document the starting and ending times for such periods. The owner or operator shall provide an explanation of causes for pellet samples that fail to meet the acceptable range for any pellet quality analysis factor. Pellet quality information and data may be submitted to EPA as Confidential Business Information.

              (vi) No later than 57 months after May 12, 2016, the owner or operator may submit to EPA a report to either confirm or modify the NOX limits for Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1 within the upper and lower bounds described below. EPA will review the report and either confirm or modify the NOX limits. If the CEMS data collected during operating periods between months 50 and 57 that both meet pellet quality specifications and proper furnace/burner operation is normally distributed, the limit adjustment determination shall be based on the appropriate (depending upon whether data are statistically independent or dependent) 95% upper predictive limit (UPL) equations in paragraph (p) of this section. If the CEMS data collected during operating periods between months 50 and 57 that both meet pellet quality specifications and proper furnace/burner operation are not normally distributed, the limit adjustment determination shall be based on the non-parametric equation provided in paragraph (p) of this section. The data set for the determination shall exclude periods when pellet quality did not fall within the defined acceptable ranges of the pellet quality factors identified pursuant to paragraph (k)(1)(v) of this section and for any subsequent period when production had been reduced in response to pellet quality concerns consistent with Tilden's ISO 9001 operating standards. Any excluded period will commence at the time documented on the production log demonstrating pellet quality did not fall within the defined acceptable range and shall end when pellet quality within the defined acceptable range has been re-established at planned production levels, which will be presumed to be the level that existed immediately prior to the reduction in production due to pellet quality concerns. EPA may also exclude data where operations are inconsistent with the reported design parameters of the NOX reduction control technology that were installed.

              (vii) EPA will take final agency action by publishing its final confirmation or modification of the NOX limits in the Federal Register no later than 60 months after May 12, 2016. The confirmed or modified NOX limit for Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1 when burning only natural gas may be no lower than 2.8 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 720-hour rolling average, and may not exceed 3.0 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 720-hour rolling average. The confirmed or modified NOX limit for Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1 when burning coal or a mixture of coal and natural gas may be no lower than 1.5 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 720-hour rolling average, and may not exceed 2.5 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 720-hour rolling average.

              (viii) If the owner or operator submits a report proposing a single NOX limit for all fuels, EPA may approve the proposed NOX limit for all fuels based on a 30-day rolling average. The confirmed or modified limit will be established and enforceable within 60 months from May 12, 2016.
              (2) SO
                2
                Emission Limits. A fuel sulfur content limit of no greater than 1.20 percent sulfur content by weight shall apply to fuel combusted in Process Boiler #1 (EUBOILER1) and Process Boiler #2 (EUBOILER2) beginning three months from March 8, 2013. A fuel sulfur content limit of no greater than 1.50 percent sulfur content by weight shall apply to fuel combusted in the Line 1 Dryer (EUDRYER1) beginning 3 months from March 8, 2013. The sampling and calculation methodology for determining the sulfur content of fuel must be described in the monitoring plan required at paragraph (n)(8)(x) of this section.

              (3) The owner or operator of the Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1 furnace shall meet an emission limit of 500 lbs SO2/hr based on a 30-day rolling average beginning six months after May 12, 2016. Compliance with these emission limits shall be demonstrated with data collected by a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for SO2. The owner or operator must start collecting CEMS data for SO2 beginning six months after May 12, 2016 and submit the data to EPA no later than 30 days from the end of each calendar quarter. The Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1 furnace shall not be limited to natural gas fuel. Beginning six months after May 12, 2016, any coal burned on Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1 shall have no more than 0.60 percent sulfur by weight based on a monthly block average. The sampling and calculation methodology for determining the sulfur content of coal must be described in the monitoring plan required for this furnace. The owner or operator must calculate an SO2 limit based on 12 continuous months of CEMS emissions data and submit such limit, calculations, and CEMS data to EPA no later than 36 months after May 12, 2016. If the submitted CEMS SO2 hourly data are normally distributed, the SO2 lbs/hr emission rate shall be based on the appropriate (depending upon whether data are statistically independent or dependent) 99% upper predictive limit (UPL) equation. If the submitted CEMS SO2 hourly data are not normally distributed, the SO2 lbs/hr emission rate shall be based on the non-parametric equation provided in paragraph (p) of this section. Compliance with the SO2 lbs/hr emission rate shall be determined on a 30-day rolling average basis. EPA will take final agency action by publishing a confirmation or modification of the SO2 limit in the Federal Register no later than 39 months after May 12, 2016. EPA may adjust the 500 lbs SO2/hr limit downward to reflect the calculated SO2 emission rate; however, EPA will not increase the SO2 limit above 500 lbs SO2/hr.

              (4) Starting 26 months from May 12, 2016, records shall be kept for any day during which fuel oil is burned as fuel (either alone or blended with other fuels) in Grate Kiln Line 1. These records must include, at a minimum, the gallons of fuel oil burned per hour, the sulfur content of the fuel oil, and the SO2 emissions in pounds per hour.
              (5) Starting 26 months from May 12, 2016, the SO2 limit for Grate Kiln Line 1 does not apply for any hour in which it is documented that there is a natural gas curtailment beyond Cliffs' control necessitating that the supply of natural gas to Tilden's Line 1 indurating furnace is restricted or eliminated. Records must be kept of the cause of the curtailment and duration of such curtailment. During such curtailment, the use of backup coal is restricted to coal with no greater than 0.60 percent sulfur by weight.
              (l) Testing and monitoring. (1) The owner or operator shall install, certify, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for NOX on Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1. Compliance with the emission limits for NOX shall be determined using data from the CEMS.

              (2) The owner or operator shall install, certify, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for SO2 on Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1. Compliance with the emission standard selected for SO2 shall be determined using data from the CEMS.

              (3) The owner or operator shall install, certify, calibrate, maintain, and operate one or more continuous diluent monitor(s) (O2 or CO2) and continuous flow rate monitor(s) on Tilden Grate Kiln Line 1 to allow conversion of the NOX and SO2 concentrations to units of the standard (lbs/MMBTU and lbs/hr, respectively) unless a demonstration is made that a diluent monitor and continuous flow rate monitor are not needed for the owner or operator to demonstrate compliance with applicable emission limits in units of the standards.
              (4) For purposes of this section, all CEMS required by this section must meet the requirements of paragraphs (l)(4)(i) through (xiv) of this section.
              (i) All CEMS must be installed, certified, calibrated, maintained, and operated in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, Performance Specification 2 (PS-2) and appendix F, Procedure 1.
              (ii) All CEMS associated with monitoring NOX (including the NOX monitor and necessary diluent and flow rate monitors) must be installed and operational upon May 12, 2016. All CEMS associated with monitoring SO2 must be installed and operational no later than six months after May 12, 2016. Verification of the CEMS operational status shall, as a minimum, include completion of the manufacturer's written requirements or recommendations for installation, operation, and calibration of the devices.
              (iii) The owner or operator must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, PS-2. The performance evaluations must be completed no later than 60 days after the respective CEMS installation.

The first CEMS accuracy test will be a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) and must be completed no later than 60 days after the respective CEMS installation.
              (v) The owner or operator of each CEMS must furnish the Regional Administrator two, or upon request, more copies of a written report of the results of each performance evaluation and QA/QC check within 60 days of completion.
              (vi) The owner or operator of each CEMS must check, record, and quantify the zero and span calibration drifts at least once daily (every 24 hours) in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 4.
              (vii) Except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, all CEMS required by this section shall be in continuous operation during all periods of process operation of the indurating furnaces, including periods of process unit startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
              (viii) All CEMS required by this section must meet the minimum data requirements at paragraphs (l)(4)(viii)(A) through (C) of this section.
              (A) Complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute quadrant of an hour.
              (B) Sample, analyze, and record emissions data for all periods of process operation except as described in paragraph (l)(4)(viii)(C) of this section.
              (C) When emission data from CEMS are not available due to continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span adjustments, emission data must be obtained using other monitoring systems or emission estimation methods approved by the EPA. The other monitoring systems or emission estimation methods to be used must be incorporated into the monitoring plan required by this section and provide information such that emissions data are available for a minimum of 18 hours in each 24-hour period and at least 22 out of 30 successive unit operating days.

              (ix) Owners or operators of each CEMS required by this section must reduce all data to 1-hour averages. Hourly averages shall be computed using all valid data obtained within the hour but no less than one data point in each 15-minute quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant in an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of performance of calibration, quality assurance, preventive maintenance activities, or backups of data from data acquisition and handling systems and recertification events.
              (x) The 30-day rolling average emission rate determined from data derived from the CEMS required by this section (in lbs/MMBTU or lbs/hr depending on the emission standard selected) must be calculated in accordance with paragraphs (l)(4)(x)(A) through (F) of this section.
              (A) Sum the total pounds of the pollutant in question emitted from the unit during an operating day and the previous 29 operating days.
              (B) Sum the total heat input to the unit (in MMBTU) or the total actual hours of operation (in hours) during an operating day and the previous 29 operating days.
              (C) Divide the total number of pounds of the pollutant in question emitted during the 30 operating days by the total heat input (or actual hours of operation depending on the emission limit selected) during the 30 operating days.

              (D) For purposes of this calculation, an operating day is any day during which fuel is combusted in the BART affected unit regardless of whether pellets are produced. Actual hours of operation are the total hours a unit is firing fuel regardless of whether a complete 24-hour operational cycle occurs (i.e., if the furnace is firing fuel for only five hours during a 24-hour period, then the actual operating hours for that day are five. Similarly, total number of pounds of the pollutant in question for that day is determined only from the CEMS data for the five hours during which fuel is combusted.)
              (E) If the owner or operator of the CEMS required by this section uses an alternative method to determine 30-day rolling averages, that method must be described in detail in the monitoring plan required by this section. The alternative method will only be applicable if the final monitoring plan and the alternative method are approved by EPA.
              (F) A new 30-day rolling average emission rate must be calculated for the period ending each new operating day.
              (xi) The 720-hour rolling average emission rate determined from data derived from the CEMS required by this section (in lbs/MMBTU) must be calculated in accordance with paragraphs (l)(4)(xi)(A) through (C) of this section.
              (A) Sum the total pounds of NOX emitted from the unit every hour and the previous (not necessarily consecutive) 719 hours for which that type of fuel (either natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas) was used.
              (B) Sum the total heat input to the unit (in MMBTU) every hour and the previous (not necessarily consecutive) 719 hours for which that type of fuel (either natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas) was used.
              (C) Divide the total number of pounds of NOX emitted during the 720 hours, as defined above, by the total heat input during the same 720-hour period. This calculation must be done separately for each fuel type (either for natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas).
              (xii) Data substitution must not be used for purposes of determining compliance under this regulation.
              (xiii) All CEMS data shall be reduced and reported in units of the applicable standard.
              (xiv) A Quality Control Program must be developed and implemented for all CEMS required by this section in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 3. The program will include, at a minimum, written procedures and operations for calibration checks, calibration drift adjustments, preventative maintenance, data collection, recording and reporting, accuracy audits/procedures, periodic performance evaluations, and a corrective action program for malfunctioning CEMS.
              (m) Recordkeeping requirements. (1)(i) Records required by this section must be kept in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious review.
              
              (ii) Records required by this section must be kept for a minimum of five years following the date of creation.

              (2) The owner or operator of the BART affected unit must maintain the records identified in paragraphs (m)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section.
              (i) A copy of each notification and report developed for and submitted to comply with this section including all documentation supporting any initial notification or notification of compliance status submitted, according to the requirements of this section.
              (ii) Records of the occurrence and duration of each startup, shutdown, and malfunction of the BART affected unit, air pollution control equipment, and CEMS required by this section.
              (iii) Records of activities taken during each startup, shutdown, and malfunction of the BART affected unit, air pollution control equipment, and CEMS required by this section.
              (iv) Records of the occurrence and duration of all major maintenance conducted on the BART affected unit, air pollution control equipment, and CEMS required by this section.

              (viii) Records of the NOX emissions during all periods of BART affected unit operation, including startup, shutdown, and malfunction, in the units of the standard. The owner or operator shall convert the monitored data into the appropriate unit of the emission limitation using appropriate conversion factors and F-factors. F-factors used for purposes of this section shall be documented in the monitoring plan and developed in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 19. The owner or operator may use an alternate method to calculate the NOX emissions upon written approval from EPA.
              (ix) Records of the SO2 emissions or records of the removal efficiency (based on CEMS data), depending on the emission standard selected, during all periods of operation, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, in the units of the standard.
              (x) Records associated with the CEMS unit including type of CEMS, CEMS model number, CEMS serial number, and initial certification of each CEMS conducted in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, Performance Specification 2 must be kept for the life of the CEMS unit.

              (vi) A statement identifying whether there were or were not any deviations from the requirements of this section during the reporting period. If there were deviations from the requirements of this section during the reporting period, then the compliance report must describe in detail the deviations which occurred, the causes of the deviations, actions taken to address the deviations, and procedures put in place to avoid such deviations in the future. If there were no deviations from the requirements of this section during the reporting period, then the compliance report must include a statement that there were no deviations. For purposes of this section, deviations include, but are not limited to, emissions in excess of applicable emission standards established by this section, failure to continuously operate an air pollution control device in accordance with operating requirements designed to assure compliance with emission standards, failure to continuously operate CEMS required by this section, and failure to maintain records or submit reports required by this section.
              (7) Each owner or operator of a CEMS required by this section must submit quarterly excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports to the Regional Administrator for each pollutant monitored for each BART affected unit monitored. All reports must be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each 3-month period of a calendar year (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December) and must include, at a minimum, the requirements of paragraphs (n)(7)(i) through (xv) of this section.
              (i) Company name and address.
              (ii) Identification and description of the process unit being monitored.
              (iii) The dates covered by the reporting period.

              (ix) A description of any changes in continuous monitoring systems, processes, or controls since the last reporting period.

              (x) A table summarizing the total duration of excess emissions, as defined in paragraphs (n)(7)(x)(A) through (B) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of those excess emissions (startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of excess emissions (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described in paragraph (n)(7)(x)(C) of this section.

              (A) For purposes of this section, an excess emission is defined as any 30-day or 720-hour rolling average period, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, during which the 30-day or 720-hour (as appropriate) rolling average emissions of either regulated pollutant (SO2 and NOX), as measured by a CEMS, exceeds the applicable emission standards in this section.
              (B)(1) For purposes of this section, if a facility calculates a 30-day rolling average emission rate in accordance with this section which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this section, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the following 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of this section as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (i.e. 31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 30-day rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 15 days after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (i.e. 30 + 15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time within a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.
              (2) For purposes of this section, if a facility calculates a 720-hour rolling average emission rate in accordance with this section which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this section, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the 24th following 720-hour rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of the rule as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (i.e. 31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 720-hour rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 360 hours after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (i.e. 30+15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time with a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.
              (C) For purposes of this section, the total percent of excess emissions will be determined by summing all periods of excess emissions (in days) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total BART affected unit operating days for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period. An operating day, as defined previously, is any day during which fuel is fired in the BART affected unit for any period of time. Because of the possible overlap of 30-day rolling average excess emissions across quarters, there are some situations where the total percent of excess emissions could exceed 100 percent. This extreme situation would only result from serious excess emissions problems where excess emissions occur for nearly every day during a reporting period.
              (xi) A table summarizing the total duration of monitor downtime, as defined in paragraph (n)(7)(xi)(A) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of the monitor downtime (monitor equipment malfunctions, non-monitor equipment malfunctions, quality assurance calibration, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of monitor downtime (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described in paragraph (n)(7)(xi)(B) of this section.
              (A) For purposes of this section, monitor downtime is defined as any period of time (in hours) during which the required monitoring system was not measuring emissions from the BART affected unit. This includes any period of CEMS QA/QC, daily zero and span checks, and similar activities.

              (B) For purposes of this section, the total percent of monitor downtime will be determined by summing all periods of monitor downtime (in hours) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total number of BART affected unit operating hours for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period.
              (xii) A table which identifies each period of excess emissions for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (n)(7)(xii)(A) through (F) of this section.
              (A) The date of each excess emission.
              (B) The beginning and end time of each excess emission.
              (C) The pollutant for which an excess emission occurred.
              (D) The magnitude of the excess emission.
              (E) The cause of the excess emission.
              (F) The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted to minimize or eliminate the excess emissions and prevent such excess emission from occurring again.
              (xiii) A table which identifies each period of monitor downtime for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (n)(7)(xiii)(A) through (D) of this section.
              (A) The date of each period of monitor downtime.
              (B) The beginning and end time of each period of monitor downtime.
              (C) The cause of the period of monitor downtime.
              (D) The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted for system repairs or adjustments to minimize or eliminate monitor downtime and prevent such downtime from occurring again.
              (xiv) If there were no periods of excess emissions during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of excess emissions during this reporting period.
              (xv) If there were no periods of monitor downtime, except for daily zero and span checks, during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of monitor downtime during this reporting period except for the daily zero and span checks.
              (8) The owner or operator of each CEMS required by this section must develop and submit for review and approval by the Regional Administrator a site specific monitoring plan. The purpose of this monitoring plan is to establish procedures and practices which will be implemented by the owner or operator in its effort to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this section. The monitoring plan must include, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (n)(8)(i) through (x) of this section.
              (i) Site specific information including the company name, address, and contact information.
              (ii) The objectives of the monitoring program implemented and information describing how those objectives will be met.
              (iii) Information on any emission factors used in conjunction with the CEMS required by this section to calculate emission rates and a description of how those emission factors were determined.
              (iv) A description of methods to be used to calculate emission rates when CEMS data are not available due to downtime associated with QA/QC events.
              (v) A description of the QA/QC program to be implemented by the owner or operator of CEMS required by this section. This can be the QA/QC program developed in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 3.
              (vi) A list of spare parts for CEMS maintained on site for system maintenance and repairs.
              (vii) A description of the procedures to be used to calculate 30-day rolling averages and 720-hour rolling averages and example calculations which show the algorithms used by the CEMS to calculate 30-day rolling averages and 720-hour rolling averages.
              (viii) A sample of the document to be used for the quarterly excess emission reports required by this section.
              (ix) A description of the procedures to be implemented to investigate root causes of excess emissions and monitor downtime and the proposed corrective actions to address potential root causes of excess emissions and monitor downtime.

              (x) A description of the sampling and calculation methodology for determining the percent sulfur by weight as a monthly block average for coal used during that month.

              (o) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by the state on November 5, 2010, does not meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(e) with respect to NOX and SO2 emissions from Tilden Mining Company L.C. of Ishpeming, Michigan.

              Identification of plan—conditional approval.
              (a) On November 12, 1993, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency submitted a revision request to Minnesota's carbon monoxide SIP for approval of the State's basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. The basic I/M program requirements apply to sources in the State's moderate nonattainment areas for carbon monoxide and includes the following counties: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington Counties. The USEPA is conditionally approving Minnesota's basic I/M program provided that the State adopt specific enforceable measures as outlined in its July 5, 1994 letter from Charles W. Williams, Commissioner, Minnesota Air Pollution Control Agency.

              (ii) Additional material.
              (A) Letter from the State of Minnesota to USEPA dated July 5, 1994.
              (b) On February 9, 1996, the State of Minnesota submitted a request to revise its particulate matter (PM) State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Saint Paul area. This SIP submittal contains administrative orders which include control measures for three companies located in the Red Rock Road area—St. Paul Terminals, Inc., Lafarge Corporation and AMG Resources Corporation. Recent exceedances were attributed to changes of emissions/operations that had occurred at particular sources in the area. The results from the modeling analysis submitted with the Red Rock Road SIP revision, preliminarily demonstrate protection of the PM National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). However, due to the lack of emission limits and specific information regarding emission distribution at Lafarge Corporation following the installation of the pneumatic unloader, EPA is conditionally approving the SIP revision at this time. Final approval will be conditioned upon EPA receiving a subsequent modeled attainment demonstration with specific emission limits for Lafarge Corporation, corrected inputs for Peavey/Con-Agra, and consideration of the sources in the 2-4 km range which have experienced emission changes that may impact the Red Rock Road attainment demonstration.

              (24) On January 7, 1985, the State of Minnesota submitted a consolidated permit rule (CPR) to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 51.160 through 51.164 for a general new source review (NSR) program, including lead. On October 25, 1985, the State submitted a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which remedied certain deficiencies (40 CFR 52.1225(d)). On October 1, 1986, and January 14, 1987, the State committed to implement its NSR program using USEPA's July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892), regulations for implementing the stack height requirements of Section 123 of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 52.1225(e)). USEPA is approving the above for general NSR purposes for all sources, except it is disapproving them for those few sources subject to an NSPS requirement (40 CFR Part 60) and exempted from review under 6 MCAR section 4.4303 B.3. For these sources, NSR Rule APC 3 (40 CFR 52.1220(c)(5)), will continue to apply. Additionally, USEPA is taking no action on the CPR in relationship to the requirements of Section 111, Part C, and Part D of the Clean Air Act.
              (i) Incorporation by reference.
              (A) Within Title 6 Environment, Minnesota Code of Administrative Rules, Part 4 Pollution Control Agency (6 MCAR 4), Rule 6 MCAR 4 section 4.0002, Parts A, B, C, and E—Definitions, Abbreviations, Applicability of Standards, and Circumvention (formerly APC 2) Proposed and Published in Volume 8 of the State of Minnesota STATE REGISTER (8 S.R.) on October 17, 1983, at 8 S.R. 682 and adopted as modified on April 16, 1984, at 8 S.R. 2275.
              (B) Rules 6 MCAR section 4.4001 through section 4.4021—Permits (formerly APC 3)—Proposed and Published on December 19, 1983, at 8 S.R. 1419 (text of rule starting at 8 S.R. 1420) and adopted as modified on April 16, 1984, at 8 S.R. 2278.
              (C) Rules 6 MCAR section 4.4301 through section 4.4305—Air Emission Facility Permits—Proposed and Published on December 19, 1983, at 8 S.R. 1419 (text of rule starting at 8 S.R. 1470) and adopted as proposed on April 16, 1984, at 8 S.R. 2276.
              (D) Rules 6 MCAR section 4.4311 through section 4.4321—Indirect Source Permits (formerly APC 19)—Proposed and Published on December 19, 1983, at 8 S.R. 1419 (text of rule starting at 8 S.R. 1472) and adopted as modified on April 16, 1984, at 8 S.R. 2277.
              (25) On July 9, 1986, the State of Minnesota submitted Rules 7005.2520 through 7005.2523, submitted to replace the rule APC-29 in the existing SIP (see paragraph (20)). This submittal also included State permits for three sources, but these permits were withdrawn from USEPA consideration on February 24, 1992. This submittal provides for regulation of particulate matter from grain handling facilities, and was submitted to satisfy a condition on the approval of Minnesota's Part D plan for particulate matter.
              (i) Incorporation by reference.
              (A) Minnesota Rule 7005.2520, Definitions; Rule 7005.2521, Standards of Performance for Dry Bulk Agricultural Commodity Facilities; Rule 7005.2522, Nuisance; and Rule 7005.2523, Control Requirements Schedule, promulgated by Minnesota on January 16, 1984, and effective at the State level on January 23, 1984.
              (ii) Additional Material.

              (A) Appendix E to Minnesota's July 9, 1986, submittal, which is a statement signed on April 18, 1986, by Thomas J. Kalitowski, Executive Director, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, interpreting Rules 7005.2520 through 7005.2523 in the context of actual barge loading practices in Minnesota.
              (26) On March 13, 1989, the State of Minnesota requested that EPA revise the referencing of regulations in the SIP to conform to the State's recodification of its regulations. On November 26, 1991, and September 18, 1992, the State submitted an official version of the recodified regulations to be incorporated into the SIP. The recodified regulations are in Chapter 7001 and Chapter 7005 of Minnesota's regulations. Not approved as part of the SIP are recodified versions of regulations which EPA previously did not approve. Therefore, the SIP does not include Rules 7005.1550 through 7005.1610 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for asbestos), Rules 7005.2300 through 7005.2330 (limits for iron and steel plants), Rules 7005.2550 through 7005.2590 (NESHAP for beryllium), Rules 7005.2650 through 7005.2690 (NESHAP for mercury), Rule 7005.0116 (Opacity Standard Adjustment) and Rule 7005.2910 (Performance Test Methods for coal handling facilities). Similarly, the SIP continues to exclude the exemption now in Rule 7001.1210 as applied to small sources subject to new source performance standards, and the SIP is approved only for “existing sources” in the case of Rules 7005.1250 through 7005.1280 (Standards of Performance for Liquid Petroleum Storage Vessels), Rules 7005.1350 through 7005.1410 (Standards of Performance for Sulfuric Acid Plants), Rules 7005.1450 through 7005.1500 (Standards of Performance for Nitric Acid Plants), and Rules 7005.2100 through 7005.2160 (Standards of Performance for Petroleum Refineries). The SIP also does not include changes in the State's Rule 7005.0100 (relating to offsets) that were withdrawn by the State on February 24, 1992, and does not include the new rules 7005.0030 and 7005.0040.
              (i) Incorporation by reference.

                emission limits. (i) United States Steel Corporation, Keetac: An emission limit of 1.5 lbs NOX/MMBtu, based on a 30-day rolling average, shall apply to the Grate Kiln pelletizing furnace (EU030), beginning 3 years from March 8, 2013. However, for any 30, or more, consecutive days when only natural gas is used a limit of 1.2 lbs NOX/MMBtu, based on a 30-day rolling average, shall apply.
              (ii) Hibbing Taconite Company—(A) Hibbing Line 1. (1) An emission limit of 1.2 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 30-day rolling average, shall apply to Hibbing Line 1 when burning natural gas. This emission limit will become enforceable 37 months after May 12, 2016 and only after EPA's confirmation or modification of the emission limit in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) through (7) of this section.
              (2) Compliance with this emission limit will be demonstrated with data collected by a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for NOX. The owner or operator of Hibbing Line 1 must install a CEMS for NOX and SO2 within six months from May 12, 2016. The owner or operator must start collecting CEMS data and submit the data to EPA no later than 30 days from the end of each calendar quarter after that installation deadline. Any remaining data through the end of the 34th month from May 12, 2016, that does not fall within a calendar quarter, must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days from the end of the 34th month. Although CEMS data must continue to be collected, it does not need to be submitted to EPA starting 34 months after May 12, 2016.
              (3) No later than 24 months after May 12, 2016 the owner or operator must submit to EPA a report, including any final report(s) completed by the selected NOX reduction technology supplier and furnace retrofit engineer, containing a detailed engineering analysis and modeling of the NOX reduction control technology being installed on Hibbing Line 1. The NOX reduction control technology must be designed to meet an emission limit of 1.2 lbs NOX/MMBTU. This report must include a list of all process and control technology variables that can reasonably be expected to have an impact on NOX emissions control technology performance, as well as a description of how these variables can be adjusted to reduce NOX emissions to meet the NOX design emission limit.
              (4) The NOX reduction control technology shall be installed on Hibbing Line 1 furnace no later than 26 months after May 12, 2016.
              (5) Commencing on the earlier of: Six months from the installation of the NOX reduction control technology; or 26 months from May 12, 2016, the owner or operator must provide to EPA the results from pellet quality analyses. The owner or operator shall provide the results from pellet quality analyses no later than 30 days from the end of each calendar quarter up until 34 months after May 12, 2016. Any remaining results through the end of the 34th month from May 12, 2016, that do not fall within a calendar quarter, must be submitted to EPA no later than 30 days from the end of the 34th month. The pellet quality analyses shall include results for the following factors: Compression, reducibility, before tumble, after tumble, low temperature disintegration, and swelling. For each of the pellet quality analysis factors, the owner or operator must explain the pellet quality analysis factor, as well as the defined acceptable range for each factor using the applicable product quality standards based upon customers' pellet specifications that are contained in Hibbing's ISO 9001 quality management system. The owner or operator shall provide pellet quality analysis testing results that state the date and time of the analysis and, in order to define the time period when pellets were produced outside of the defined acceptable range for the pellet quality factors listed, provide copies of the production logs that document the starting and ending times for such periods. The owner or operator shall provide an explanation of causes for pellet samples that fail to meet the acceptable range for any pellet quality analysis factor. Pellet quality information and data may be submitted to EPA as Confidential Business Information.
              (6) No later than 34 months after May 12, 2016, the owner or operator may submit to EPA a report to either confirm or modify the NOX limits for Hibbing Line 1 furnace within the upper and lower bounds described below. EPA will review the report and either confirm or modify the NOX limits. If the CEMS data collected during operating periods between months 26 and 34 that both meet pellet quality specifications and proper furnace/burner operation is normally distributed, the limit adjustment determination shall be based on the appropriate (depending upon whether data are statistically independent or dependent) 95% upper predictive limit (UPL) equations in paragraph (f) of this section. If the CEMS data collected during operating periods between months 26 and 34 that both meet pellet quality specifications and proper furnace/burner operation are not normally distributed, the limit adjustment determination shall be based on the non-parametric equation provided in paragraph (f) of this section. The data set for the determination shall exclude periods when pellet quality did not fall within the defined acceptable ranges of the pellet quality factors identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this section and for any subsequent period when production has been reduced in response to pellet quality concerns consistent with Hibbing's ISO 9001 operating standards. Any excluded period will commence at the time documented on the production log demonstrating that pellet quality did not fall within the defined acceptable range and shall end when pellet quality within the defined acceptable range has been re-established at planned production levels, which will be presumed to be the level that existed immediately prior to the reduction in production due to pellet quality concerns. EPA may also exclude data where operations are inconsistent with the reported design parameters of the NOX reduction control technology installed.
              (7) EPA will take final agency action by publishing its final confirmation or modification of the NOX limit in the Federal Register no later than 37 months after May 12, 2016. The confirmed or modified NOX limit for Hibbing Line 1 when burning only natural gas may be no lower than 1.2 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 30-day rolling average, and may not exceed 1.8 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 30-day rolling average.

If the CEMS data collected during operating periods between months 44 and 52 that both meet pellet quality specifications and proper furnace/burner operation are not normally distributed, the limit adjustment determination shall be based on the non-parametric equation provided in paragraph (f) of this section. The data set for the determination shall exclude periods when pellet quality did not fall within the defined acceptable ranges of the pellet quality factors identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(v)(A)(5) of this section and for any subsequent period when production has been reduced in response to pellet quality concerns consistent with the ArcelorMittal Minorca Mine's Standard Product Parameters. Any excluded period will commence at the time documented in related quality reports demonstrating that pellet quality did not fall within the defined acceptable range and shall end when pellet quality within the defined acceptable range has been re-established at planned production levels, which will be presumed to be the level that existed immediately prior to the reduction in production due to pellet quality concerns. EPA may also exclude data where operations are inconsistent with the reported design parameters of the NOX reduction control technology installed.
              (7) EPA will take final agency action by publishing its final confirmation or modification of the NOX limit in the Federal Register no later than 55 months after May 12, 2016. The confirmed or modified NOX limit for the ArcelorMittal Minorca Mine indurating furnace when burning only natural gas may be no lower than 1.2 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 30-day rolling average, and may not exceed 1.8 lbs NOX/MMBTU, based on a 30-day rolling average.

The first CEMS accuracy test will be a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) and must be completed no later than 60 days after the respective CEMS installation.
              (v) The owner or operator of each CEMS must furnish the Regional Administrator two, or upon request, more copies of a written report of the results of each performance evaluation and QA/QC check within 60 days of completion.
              (vi) The owner or operator of each CEMS must check, record, and quantify the zero and span calibration drifts at least once daily (every 24 hours) in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 4.
              (vii) Except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, all CEMS required by this section shall be in continuous operation during all periods of BART affected process unit operation, including periods of process unit startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
              (viii) All CEMS required by this section must meet the minimum data requirements at paragraphs (c)(4)(viii)(A) through (C) of this section.
              (A) Complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute quadrant of an hour.
              (B) Sample, analyze, and record emissions data for all periods of process operation except as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(C) of this section.
              (C) When emission data from CEMS are not available due to continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span adjustments, emission data must be obtained using other monitoring systems or emission estimation methods approved by the EPA. The other monitoring systems or emission estimation methods to be used must be incorporated into the monitoring plan required by this section and provide information such that emissions data are available for a minimum of 18 hours in each 24-hour period and at least 22 out of 30 successive unit operating days.
              (ix) Owners or operators of each CEMS required by this section must reduce all data to 1-hour averages. Hourly averages shall be computed using all valid data obtained within the hour but no less than one data point in each 15-minute quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant in an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of performance of calibration, quality assurance, preventive maintenance activities, or backups of data from data acquisition and handling systems and recertification events.
              (x) The 30-day rolling average emission rate determined from data derived from the CEMS required by this section (in lbs/MMBTU or lbs/hr depending on the emission standard selected) must be calculated in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(x)(A) through (F) of this section.

              (A) Sum the total pounds of the pollutant in question emitted from the unit during an operating day and the previous 29 operating days.
              
              (B) Sum the total heat input to the unit (in MMBTU) or the total actual hours of operation (in hours) during an operating day and the previous 29 operating days.
              (C) Divide the total number of pounds of the pollutant in question emitted during the 30 operating days by the total heat input (or actual hours of operation depending on the emission limit selected) during the 30 operating days.

              (D) For purposes of this calculation, an operating day is any day during which fuel is combusted in the BART affected unit regardless of whether pellets are produced. Actual hours of operation are the total hours a unit is firing fuel regardless of whether a complete 24-hour operational cycle occurs (i.e. if the furnace is firing fuel for only five hours during a 24-hour period, then the actual operating hours for that day are five. Similarly, total number of pounds of the pollutant in question for that day is determined only from the CEMS data for the five hours during which fuel is combusted.)
              (E) If the owner or operator of the CEMS required by this section uses an alternative method to determine 30-day rolling averages, that method must be described in detail in the monitoring plan required by this section. The alternative method will only be applicable if the final monitoring plan and the alternative method are approved by EPA.

If there were deviations from the requirements of this section during the reporting period, then the compliance report must describe in detail the deviations which occurred, the causes of the deviations, actions taken to address the deviations, and procedures put in place to avoid such deviations in the future. If there were no deviations from the requirements of this section during the reporting period, then the compliance report must include a statement that there were no deviations. For purposes of this section, deviations include, but are not limited to, emissions in excess of applicable emission standards established by this section, failure to continuously operate an air pollution control device in accordance with operating requirements designed to assure compliance with emission standards, failure to continuously operate CEMS required by this section, and failure to maintain records or submit reports required by this section.
              (7) Each owner or operator of a CEMS required by this section must submit quarterly excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports for each pollutant monitored for each BART affected unit monitored. All reports must be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each three-month period of a calendar year (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December) and must include, at a minimum, the requirements at paragraphs (e)(7)(i) through (xv) of this section.

              (vi) Pollutant monitored.
              (vii) Emission limitation for the monitored pollutant.
              (viii) Date of latest CEMS certification or audit.
              (ix) A description of any changes in continuous monitoring systems, processes, or controls since the last reporting period.
              (x) A table summarizing the total duration of excess emissions, as defined at paragraphs (e)(7)(x)(A) through (B) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of those excess emissions (startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of excess emissions (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described at paragraph (e)(7)(x)(C) of this section.

              (A) For purposes of this section, an excess emission is defined as any 30-day or 720-hour rolling average period, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, during which the 30-day or 720-hour (as appropriate) rolling average emissions of either regulated pollutant (SO2 and NOX), as measured by a CEMS, exceeds the applicable emission standards in this section.
              (B)(1) For purposes of this rule, if a facility calculates a 30-day rolling average emission rate in accordance with this rule which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this rule, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the following 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of this rule as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (i.e. 31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 30-day rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 15 days after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (i.e. 30 + 15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time within a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.
              (2) For purposes of this section, if a facility calculates a 720-hour rolling average emission rate in accordance with this rule which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this section, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the 24th following 720-hour rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of the rule as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (i.e. 31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 720-hour rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 360 hours after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (i.e. 30+15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time with a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.
              (C) For purposes of this section, the total percent of excess emissions will be determined by summing all periods of excess emissions (in days) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total BART affected unit operating days for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period. An operating day, as defined previously, is any day during which fuel is fired in the BART affected unit for any period of time. Because of the possible overlap of 30-day rolling average excess emissions across quarters, there are some situations where the total percent of excess emissions could exceed 100 percent. This extreme situation would only result from serious excess emissions problems where excess emissions occur for nearly every day during a reporting period.
              (xi) A table summarizing the total duration of monitor downtime, as defined at paragraph (e)(7)(xi)(A) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of the monitor downtime (monitor equipment malfunctions, non-monitor equipment malfunctions, quality assurance calibration, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of monitor downtime (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described at paragraph (e)(7)(xi)(B) of this section.
              (A) For purposes of this section, monitor downtime is defined as any period of time (in hours) during which the required monitoring system was not measuring emissions from the BART affected unit. This includes any period of CEMS QA/QC, daily zero and span checks, and similar activities.
              (B) For purposes of this section, the total percent of monitor downtime will be determined by summing all periods of monitor downtime (in hours) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total number of BART affected unit operating hours for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period.
              (xii) A table which identifies each period of excess emissions for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (e)(7)(xii)(A) through (F) of this section.
              (A) The date of each excess emission.
              (B) The beginning and end time of each excess emission.
              (C) The pollutant for which an excess emission occurred.
              (D) The magnitude of the excess emission.
              (E) The cause of the excess emission.
              (F) The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted to minimize or eliminate the excess emissions and prevent such excess emission from occurring again.
              (xiii) A table which identifies each period of monitor downtime for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (e)(7)(xiii)(A) through (D) of this section.
              (A) The date of each period of monitor downtime.

              (B) The beginning and end time of each period of monitor downtime.
              
              (C) The cause of the period of monitor downtime.
              (D) The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted for system repairs or adjustments to minimize or eliminate monitor downtime and prevent such downtime from occurring again.
              (xiv) If there were no periods of excess emissions during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of excess emissions during this reporting period.
              (xv) If there were no periods of monitor downtime, except for daily zero and span checks, during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of monitor downtime during this reporting period except for the daily zero and span checks.
              (8) The owner or operator of each CEMS required by this section must develop and submit for review and approval by the Regional Administrator a site specific monitoring plan. The purpose of this monitoring plan is to establish procedures and practices which will be implemented by the owner or operator in its effort to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this section. The monitoring plan must include, at a minimum, the information at paragraphs (e)(8)(i) through (x) of this section.
              (i) Site specific information including the company name, address, and contact information.
              (ii) The objectives of the monitoring program implemented and information describing how those objectives will be met.
              (iii) Information on any emission factors used in conjunction with the CEMS required by this section to calculate emission rates and a description of how those emission factors were determined.
              (iv) A description of methods to be used to calculate emission rates when CEMS data are not available due to downtime associated with QA/QC events.
              (v) A description of the QA/QC program to be implemented by the owner or operator of CEMS required by this section. This can be the QA/QC program developed in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 3.
              (vi) A list of spare parts for CEMS maintained on site for system maintenance and repairs.
              (vii) A description of the procedures to be used to calculate 30-day rolling averages and 720-hour rolling averages and example calculations which show the algorithms used by the CEMS to calculate 30-day rolling averages and 720-hour rolling averages.
              (viii) A sample of the document to be used for the quarterly excess emission reports required by this section.
              (ix) A description of the procedures to be implemented to investigate root causes of excess emissions and monitor downtime and the proposed corrective actions to address potential root causes of excess emissions and monitor downtime.
              (x) A description of the sampling and calculation methodology for determining the percent sulfur by weight as a monthly block average for coal used during that month.
              (f) Equations for establishing the upper predictive limit—(1) Equation for normal distribution and statistically independent data.

              § 52.1236
              Visibility protection.
              (a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met, because the plan does not include approvable procedures for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
              (b) Regulation for visibility monitoring and new source review. The provisions of § 52.28 are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for the State of Minnesota.
              (c) [Reserved]

              (d) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by the state on December 30, 2009, and on May 8, 2012, does not meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(e) with respect to NOX and SO2 emissions from United States Steel Corporation, Keetac of Keewatin, Minnesota; Hibbing taconite company of Hibbing, Minnesota; United States Steel Corporation, Minntac of Mountain Iron, Minnesota; United Taconite, LLC of Forbes, Minnesota; ArcelorMittal Minorca Mine, Inc. near Virginia, Minnesota; and Northshore Mining Company-Silver Bay of Silver Bay, Minnesota. The requirements for these facilities are satisfied by complying with the requirements of § 52.1235.

              (e)(1) On and after the 30-boiler-operating-day period ending on September 30, 2015, the owners and operators of the facility at 13999 Industrial Boulevard in Becker, Sherburne County, Minnesota, shall not cause or permit the emission of SO2 from stack SV001 (serving Units 1 and 2) to exceed 0.050 lbs/MMBTU as a 30-day rolling average.
              

              (2) On and after the 30-boiler-operating-day period ending on May 31, 2017, the owners and operators of the facility at 13999 Industrial Boulevard in Becker, Sherburne County, Minnesota, shall not cause or permit the emission of SO2 from Unit 3 to exceed 0.29 lbs/MMBTU as a 30-day rolling average.

              (3) The owners and operators of the facility at 13999 Industrial Boulevard in Becker, Sherburne County, Minnesota, shall operate continuous SO2 emission monitoring systems in compliance with 40 CFR 75, and the data from this emission monitoring shall be used to determine compliance with the limits in this paragraph (e).
              (4) For each boiler operating day, compliance with the 30-day average limitations in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section shall be determined by summing total emissions in pounds for the period consisting of the day and the preceding 29 successive boiler operating days, summing total heat input in MMBTU for the same period, and computing the ratio of these sums in lbs/MMBTU. Boiler operating day is used to mean a 24-hour period between 12 midnight and the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time in the steam-generating unit. It is not necessary for fuel to be combusted the entire 24-hour period. A boiler operating day with respect to the limitation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be a day in which fuel is combusted in either Unit 1 or Unit 2. Bias adjustments provided for under 40 CFR 75 appendix A shall be applied. Substitute data provided for under 40 CFR 75 subpart D shall not be used.

              § 52.1237
              Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.
              (a) The base year carbon monoxide emission inventory requirement of section 187(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for the following areas: Duluth Metropolitan Area and Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area.
              (b) Approval—The 1993 carbon monoxide periodic emission inventory requirement of section 187(a)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for the following areas: the counties of the Twin cities seven county Metropolitan area (Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington), and Wright.
              (c) Approval—On March 23, 1998, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency submitted a request to redesignate the Minneapolis/St. Paul CO nonattainment area (consisting of portions of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, Washington, and Wright) to attainment for CO. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1996 attainment year) emission inventory for CO, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2009, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the CO NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Minnesota will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes oxygenated fuel, transportation control measures, or a vehicle inspection and maintenance program. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively.
              (d) Approval—On November 10, 2004, Minnesota submitted a revision to the Carbon Monoxide (CO) maintenance plan for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. These plans revised 1996 and 2009 motor vehicle emission inventories and 2009 Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (MVEB) recalculated using the emissions factor model MOBILE6. The MVEB for transportation conformity purposes for the Minneapolis-St. Paul maintenance area is 1961 tons per winter day of CO.

              (e) Approval—On June 16, 2010, Minnesota submitted a carbon monoxide (CO) limited maintenance plan for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area under section 175A of the CAA for the continued attainment of the one hour and eight hour CO NAAQS.
              (f) Approval—On July 16, 2015, the State of Minnesota submitted a revision to their Particulate Matter State Implementation Plan. The submittal establishes transportation conformity criteria and procedures related to interagency consultation, and the enforceability of certain transportation related control and mitigation measures.

              § 52.1238
              Control strategy: Lead (Pb).
              (a) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2012 to 2014, EPA determined that the Eagan, Minnesota lead nonattainment area attained the 2008 Lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This clean data determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2008 lead NAAQS.

              (a)(1) The owner and operator of each source located within the State of Minnesota and for which requirements are set forth under the Federal CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program in subparts AA through II of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such applicable requirements. The obligation to comply with these requirements in part 97 of this chapter will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) as meeting the requirements of CAIR for PM2.5 relating to NOX under § 51.123 of this chapter, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional or unless such approval is under § 51.123(p) of this chapter.

              (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the Administrator has already allocated CAIR NOX allowances to sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation of CAIR NOX allowances for those years shall continue to apply, unless the Administrator approves a SIP provision that provides for the allocation of the remaining CAIR NOX allowances for those years.
              (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, such paragraph is not applicable as it relates to sources in the State of Minnesota as of December 3, 2009, except that:

              (1) The owner and operator of each source referenced in such paragraph in whose compliance account any allocation of CAIR NOX allowances was recorded under the Federal CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program in part 97 of this chapter shall hold in that compliance account, as of midnight of December 3, 2009 and with regard to each such recorded allocation, CAIR NOX allowances that are usable in such trading program, issued for the same year as the recorded allocation, and in the same amount as the recorded allocation. The owner and operator shall hold such allowances for the purpose of deduction by the Administrator under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

              (2) After December 3, 2009, the Administrator will deduct from the compliance account of each source in the State of Minnesota any CAIR NOX allowances required to be held in that compliance account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Administrator will not deduct, for purposes of implementing the stay, any other CAIR NOX allowances held in that compliance account and, starting no later than December 3, 2009, will not record any allocation of CAIR NOX allowances included in the State trading budget for Minnesota for any year.

              (c)(1) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Minnesota and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NOX Annual Trading Program in subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units in the State will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Minnesota's State Implementation Plan (SIP) as correcting the SIP's deficiency that is the basis for the CSAPR Federal Implementation Plan under § 52.38(a) for those sources and units, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units located in Indian country within the borders of the State will not be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Minnesota's SIP.

              (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if, at the time of the approval of Minnesota's SIP revision described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Administrator has already started recording any allocations of CSAPR NOX Annual allowances under subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter to units in the State for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation and recordation of CSAPR NOX Annual allowances to units in the State for each such control period shall continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the State's SIP revision.

                  The approval does not include incorporation by reference of the CO2 Biomass Deferral which was withdrawn by the State on October 22, 2014. On 9-26-2012, EPA approved a revision to APC-S-5 which incorporated by reference the regulations found at 40 CFR 52.21 as of March 22, 2011. This approval did not include Mississippi's revision to IBR (at Rule APC-S-5) the term “particulate matter emissions” (as promulgated in the May 16, 2008 NSR PM2.5 Rule (at 40 CFR 51.166(b)(49)(vi)) and the PM2.5 SILs threshold and provisions (as promulgated in the October 20, 2010 PM2.5 PSD Increment-SILs-SMC Rule at 40 CFR 52.21(k)(2)). Note: On October 22, 2014, Mississippi withdrew the PM2.5 SILs provision from Mississippi's May 18, 2011 SIP Submission.
                
                
                  
                   
                  
                  
                  

                  On December 29, 2010, EPA approved a revision to APC-S-5 which incorporated by reference the regulations found at 40 CFR 52.21 as of September 13, 2010. See 75 FR 81858. That action approved the incorporation by reference with the exception of the phrase “except ethanol production facilities producing ethanol by natural fermentation under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 325193 or 312140,” APC-S-5 incorporated by reference from 40 CFR 52.21(b)(1)(i)(a) and (b)(1(iii)(t). Additionally, that final EPA action did not incorporate by reference, into the Mississippi SIP, the administrative regulations that were amended in the Fugitive Emissions Rule (73 FR 77882) and are stayed through October 3, 2011.

              § 52.1272
              Approval status.
              With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Mississippi's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of part D, title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977.

              § 52.1273
              Control strategy: Ozone.
              (a) Determination of attainment. The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Memphis, TN-MS-AR 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment area has attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Memphis, TN-MS-AR nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

              § 52.1275
              Legal authority.
              (a) The requirements of § 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance of a national air quality standard is not adequate.

              (b) The requirements of § 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, since section 7106-117 of the Mississippi Code could, in some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, section 7106-117 is disapproved.

              General requirements.
              (a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met, since the legal authority to provide public availability of emission data is inadequate.
              (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
              (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
              (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
              (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

              § 52.1278
              Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.
              (a) In a letter dated January 30, 1987, the Mississippi Department of Natural Resources certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules. This certification does not apply to: Mississippi Power-Daniel; South Mississippi Electric Power, Hattiesburg-Morrow; E.I. Dupont, Delisle Boilers 1 & 2; and International Paper, Vicksburg.
              (b) Disapproval. EPA is disapproving portions of Mississippi's Infrastructure SIP for the 1997 annual and 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS addressing section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) that requires the State to comply with section 128 of the CAA.

              § 52.1279
              Visibility protection.
              (a) Regional Haze. The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by Mississippi on September 22, 2008, and supplemented on May 9, 2011, does not include fully approvable measures for meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3) and 51.308(e) with respect to emissions of NOX and SO2 from electric generating units. EPA has given limited disapproval to the plan provisions addressing these requirements.
              (b) Disapproval. EPA has disapproved the portions of Mississippi's May 29, 2012, 2008 8-hour Ozone infrastructure SIP submission; July 26, 2012, 2008 8-hour Ozone infrastructure SIP resubmission; February 28, 2013, 2010, 1-hour NO2 infrastructure SIP submission; June 20, 2013, 2010 1-hour SO2 infrastructure SIP submission; and December 8, 2015, 2012, Annual PM2.5 infrastructure SIP submission that address the visibility protection (prong 4) requirements of Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II). EPA disapproved the prong 4 portions of these SIP submissions because Mississippi does not have a fully approved regional haze SIP that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308 and because these SIP submissions do not otherwise demonstrate that emissions within the State do not interfere with other states' plans to protect visibility.

              Interstate pollutant transport provisions; What are the FIP requirements for decreases in emissions of nitrogen oxides?

              (a) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Mississippi and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 1 Trading Program in subpart BBBBB of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements with regard to emissions occurring in 2015 and 2016.

              (b) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Mississippi and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 2 Trading Program in subpart EEEEE of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements with regard to emissions occurring in 2017 and each subsequent year. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units in the State will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Mississippi's State Implementation Plan (SIP) as correcting the SIP's deficiency that is the basis for the CSAPR Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) under § 52.38(b) for those sources and units, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional. The obligation to comply with such requirements with regard to sources and units located in Indian country within the borders of the State will not be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to Mississippi's SIP.

              (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, if, at the time of the approval of Mississippi's SIP revision described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator has already started recording any allocations of CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 2 allowances under subpart EEEEE of part 97 of this chapter to units in the State for a control period in any year, the provisions of subpart EEEEE of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation and recordation of CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 2 allowances to units in the State for each such control period shall continue to apply, unless provided otherwise by such approval of the State's SIP revision.

              § 52.1323
              Approval status.

              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Missouri's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards. Continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980, for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each successive January of Additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued the previous January. New source review permits issued pursuant to section 173 of the Clean Air Act will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of Section V of the emission offset interpretive rule published on January 16, 1979 (44 FR 3274) are met.
              (b) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-2.290 as identified under § 52.1320, paragraph (c)(65), with the understanding that any alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved by EPA as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the reduction requirements stated in the rule.
              (c) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-2.230 as identified under § 52.1320, paragraph (c)(70), with the understanding that any alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved by EPA as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the emission limits stated in the rule.
              (d) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-5.340 as identified under § 52.1320, paragraph (c)(71), with the understanding that any alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the reduction requirements stated in the rule.
              (e) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-5.330 as identified under § 52.1320, paragraph (c)(72), under the following terms, to which the state of Missouri has agreed: Subsections (5)(B)3 and (7)(B) of the rule contain provisions whereby the director of the Missouri Air Pollution Control Program has discretion to establish compliance determination procedures and equivalent alternative emission limits for individual sources. Any such director discretion determinations under this rule must be submitted to EPA for approval as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of EPA approval, the enforceable requirements of the SIP are the applicable emission limit(s) in subsection (4)(B) and the compliance determination provisions stated in subsection(5)(B)1 or (5)(B)2.
              (f) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-6.120 as identified under § 52.1320(c)(76), under the following terms, to which the state of Missouri has agreed. Subparagraph (2)(B)2.B.(IV) contains a provision whereby the Director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources has discretion to approve revisions to the Doe Run Herculaneum work practice manual. Any revisions to the work practice manual, pursuant to this rule, must be submitted to EPA for approval as an individual SIP revision. Thus, any existing federally approved work practices remain in effect, until such time that subsequent revisions are submitted to EPA and approved as SIP revisions.
              (g) The Missouri portion of the Kansas City metropolitan area was designated as nonattainment for ozone in 40 CFR part 81. Therefore, the Administrator approves continuation of the 7.8 RVP limit as federally enforceable in the Kansas City metropolitan area, even after the area is redesignated to attainment, because of its nonattainment designation effective January 6, 1992. Also, the requirement for 7.8 psi RVP volatility is deemed necessary to ensure attainment and maintenance of the ozone standard as demonstrated by the emissions inventory projections (based on use of 7.8 psi RVP) in Missouri's ozone maintenance plan for the Kansas City metropolitan area.

              (h) The state of Missouri commits to revise 10 CSR 6.300 to remove language in paragraphs (3)(C)4. and (9)(B) which is more stringent than the language in the Federal General Conformity rule. In a letter to Mr. Dennis Grams, Regional Administrator, EPA, dated December 7, 1995, Mr. David Shorr, Director, MDNR, stated:
              
              
                We commit to initiating a change in the wording in the above paragraphs [paragraphs (3)(C)4. and (9)(B)] of Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-6.300, and to submit the change to EPA within one year from the date of this letter [December 7, 1995]. We intend that the change will give our rule the same stringency as the General Conformity Rule.
              
              
              
              (i) Emission limitations and related provisions which are established in Missouri's operation permits as federally enforceable conditions shall be enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures, and be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements or the requirements of EPA's underlying regulations.
              (j) The state of Missouri revised 10 CSR 10-6.300 to remove language in paragraphs (3)(C)4 and (9)(B) which made the language more stringent than that contained in the Federal general conformity rule. This fulfills the requirements of the conditional approval granted effective May 10, 1996, as published on March 11, 1996.
              (k) The state of Missouri revised 10 CSR 10-2.390 for Kansas City and 10 CSR 10-5.480 for St. Louis to update the transportation conformity requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart T, effective November 14, 1995.
              (l) The Administrator conditionally approves Missouri emergency rule 10 CSR 10-2.330 under § 52.1320(c)(98). Full approval is contingent on the state submitting the permanent rule, to the EPA, by November 30, 1997.
              (m) The Administrator approves Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-2.330 under § 52.1320(c)(105). This fulfills the requirements of the conditional approval granted effective November 10, 1997, as published on October 9, 1997.
              (n) [Reserved]
              (o) The Administrator conditionally approves the Missouri SIP revisions that address the requirements of RACT under the 8-hour ozone NAAQS under § 52.1320(c). Full approval is contingent on Missouri submitting RACT rules for inclusion into the Missouri SIP to address the Solvent Cleanup Operations CTG, to the EPA, no later than December 31, 2012.

              Approval status.
              With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Montana's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below.

              Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.
              (a) On July 8, 1997, the Governor of Montana submitted revisions to the SIP narrative for the Missoula carbon monoxide control plan.
              (b) Revisions to the Montana State Implementation Plan, revised Carbon Monoxide Maintenance Plan for Billings, as submitted by the Governor's Designee on July 13, 2011, and the associated Alternative Monitoring Strategy for Billings, as submitted by the Governor's Designee on June 22, 2012.
              (c) Revisions to the Montana State Implementation Plan, revised Carbon Monoxide Maintenance Plan for Great Falls, as submitted by the Governor's Designee on July 13, 2011, and the associated Alternative Monitoring Strategy for Great Falls, as submitted by the Governor's Designee on June 22, 2012.

              (d) Revisions to the Montana State Implementation Plan, revised Carbon Monoxide Maintenance Plan for Missoula, as submitted by the Governor on September 19, 2016 (as approved by the EPA on February 1, 2018).

              Control strategy: Particulate matter.
              (a) On July 8, 1997, the Governor of Montana submitted minor revisions to the Columbia Falls, Butte and Missoula PM-10 SIPS.
              (b) Determination—EPA has determined that the Whitefish PM10 “moderate” nonattainment area attained the PM10 national ambient air quality standard by December 31, 1999. This determination is based on air quality monitoring data from 1997, 1998, and 1999. EPA has determined that the Thompson Falls PM10 “moderate” nonattainment area attained the PM10 national ambient air quality standard by December 31, 2000. This determination is based on air quality monitoring data from 1998, 1999, and 2000.
              (c) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, July 14, 2015, based on quality-assured air monitoring data for 2007-2009 and 2012-2014 ambient air quality data, that the Libby, MT fine particulate matter (PM2.5) nonattainment area attained the 1997 annual PM2.5 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). Therefore, EPA has met the requirement of CAA section 188(b)(2) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date or as expeditiously as practicable, whether the area attained the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS. Additionally, this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.

              (d) On August 3, 2016, the State of Montana submitted a maintenance plan for the Missoula PM10 nonattaiment area and requested that this area be redesignated to attainment for the PM10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The redesignation request and maintenance plan satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.

              Determination—EPA has determined that the East Helena Lead nonattainment area has attained the lead national ambient air quality standards through calendar year 1999. This determination is based on air quality data currently in the AIRS database (as of the date of our determination, June 18, 2001).

              On October 7, 1993, EPA granted the request by the State for the full three years allowed by section 172(b) of the CAA, as amended in 1990, for submittal of the SIP for the East Helena area to attain and maintain the sulfur dioxide secondary NAAQS. Therefore, the SIP for the area was due November 15, 1993. The SIP was not submitted by that date.

              (a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission data is inadequate.

              (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
              (2) Commencing after the initial nonecessary by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
              (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
              (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

We cannot approve these provisions into the SIP, as it would allow the State to change a SIP requirement through the issuance of a permit. Pursuant to section 110 of the Act, to change a requirement of the SIP, the State must adopt a SIP revision and obtain our approval of the revision.
              (b)(1) In 40 CFR 52.1370(c)(51), we incorporated by reference several documents that comprise the East Helena Lead SIP. Sections 52.1370(c)(51)(i)(B) and (C) indicate that certain provisions of the documents that were incorporated by reference were excluded. The excluded provisions of § 52.1370(c)(51)(i)(B) and (C) are disapproved. These provisions are disapproved because they do not entirely conform to the requirement of section 110(a)(2) of the Act that SIP limits must be enforceable, nor to the requirement of section 110(i) that the SIP can be modified only through the SIP revision process. The following phrases, words, or section in exhibit A of the stipulation between the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and Asarco, adopted by order issued on June 26, 1996 by the Montana Board of Environmental Review (MBER), are disapproved:

              (1) In § 52.1370(c)(46)(i)(A) through (G), certain provisions of the documents incorporated by reference were excluded. The following provisions that were excluded by § 52.1370(c)(46)(i)(A) through (G) are disapproved. We cannot approve these provisions because they do not conform to the requirements of the Clean Air Act:

              (f) ExxonMobil emission limits and compliance determining methods—(1) Introduction. The provisions for ExxonMobil cover the following units:

              (i) The Primary process flare and the Turnaround flare. The Primary process flare is the flare normally used by ExxonMobil. The Turnaround flare is the flare ExxonMobil uses for about 30 to 40 days every 5 to 6 years when the facility's major SO2 source, the fluid catalytic cracking unit, is not normally operating.
              
              (ii) The following refinery fuel gas combustion units: The FCC CO Boiler, F-2 crude/vacuum heater, F-3 unit, F-3X unit, F-5 unit, F-700 unit, F-201 unit, F-202 unit, F-402 unit, F-551 unit, F-651 unit, standby boiler house (B-8 boiler), and Coker CO Boiler (only when the Yellowstone Energy Limited Partnership (YELP) facility is receiving ExxonMobil Coker unit flue gas or whenever the ExxonMobil Coker is not operating).
              (iii) Coker CO Boiler stack.
              (2) Flare requirements—(i) Emission limit. The total combined emissions of SO2 from the Primary process and Turnaround refinery flares shall not exceed 150.0 pounds per 3-hour period.
              (ii) Compliance determining method. Compliance with the emission limit in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. If volumetric flow monitoring device(s) installed and concentration monitoring methods used to measure the gas stream to the Primary Process flare cannot measure the gas stream to the Turnaround flare, ExxonMobil may apply to EPA for alternative measures to determine the volumetric flow rate and total sulfur concentration of the gas stream to the Turnaround flare. Before EPA will approve such alternative measures, ExxonMobil must agree that the Turnaround flare will be used only during refinery turnarounds of limited duration and frequency—no more than 60 days once every five (5) years—which restriction shall be considered an enforceable part of this FIP. Such alternative measures may consist of reliable flow estimation parameters to estimate volumetric flow rate and manual sampling of the gas stream to the flare to determine total sulfur concentrations, or such other measures that EPA finds will provide accurate estimations of SO2 emissions from the Turnaround flare.
              (3) Refinery fuel gas combustion requirements—(i) Emission limits. The applicable emission limits are contained in section 3(A)(1) of ExxonMobil's 2000 exhibit and section 3(B)(2) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit.
              (ii) Compliance determining method. For the limits referenced in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the compliance determining methods specified in section 4(B) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit shall be followed except when the H2S concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream exceeds 1200 ppmv as measured by the H2S CEMS required by section 6(B)(3) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit (the H2S CEMS.) When such value is exceeded, the following compliance monitoring method shall be employed:
              (A) ExxonMobil shall measure the H2S concentration in the refinery fuel gas according to the procedures in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section and calculate the emissions according to the equations in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
              (B) Within four (4) hours after the H2S CEMS measures an H2S concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream greater than 1200 ppmv, ExxonMobil shall initiate sampling of the refinery fuel gas stream at the fuel header on a once-per-hour frequency using length-of-stain detector tubes pursuant to ASTM Method D4810-06, “Standard Test Method for Hydrogen Sulfide in Natural Gas Using Length-of-Stain Detector Tubes” (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) with the appropriate sample tube range. If the results exceed the tube's range, another tube of a higher range must be used until results are in the tube's range. ExxonMobil shall continue to use the length-of-stain detector tube method at this frequency until the H2S CEMS measures an H2S concentration in the refinery fuel gas stream equal to or less than 1200 ppmv continuously over a 3-hour period.

              (C) When the length-of-stain detector tube method is required, SO2 emissions from refinery fuel gas combustion shall be calculated as follows: the Hourly emissions shall be calculated using equation 1, 3-hour emissions shall be calculated using equation 2, and the Daily emissions shall be calculated using equation 3.
              
              Equation 1: EH = K * CH * QH
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                EH = Refinery fuel gas combustion hourly emissions in pounds per hour, rounded to the nearest tenth of a pound;
                K= 1.688 × 10−7 in (pounds/standard cubic feet (SCF))/parts per million (ppm);
                CH = Hourly refinery fuel gas H2S concentration in ppm determined by the length-of-stain detector tube method as required by paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and
                QH = actual fuel gas firing rate in standard cubic feet per hour (SCFH), as measured by the monitor required by section 6(B)(8) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit.
              
              
              Equation 2: (Refinery fuel gas combustion 3-hour emissions) = ∑ (Hourly emissions within the 3-hour period as determined by equation 1).
              Equation 3: (Refinery fuel gas combustion daily emissions) = ∑ (3-hour emissions within the day as determined by equation 2).
              
              (4) Coker CO Boiler stack requirements—(i) Emission limits. When ExxonMobil's Coker unit is operating and Coker unit flue gases are burned in the Coker CO Boiler, the applicable emission limits are contained in section 3(B)(1) of ExxonMobil's 2000 exhibit.
              (ii) Compliance determining method. (A) Compliance with the emission limits referenced in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section shall be determined by measuring the SO2 concentration and flow rate in the Coker CO Boiler stack according to the procedures in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section and calculating emissions according to the equations in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.
              (B) Beginning on May 21, 2008, ExxonMobil shall operate and maintain a CEMS to measure sulfur dioxide concentrations in the Coker CO Boiler stack. Whenever ExxonMobil's Coker unit is operating and Coker unit flue gases are exhausted through the Coker CO Boiler stack, the CEMS shall be operational and shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) concentration measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and meet the CEMS Performance Specifications contained in section 6(C) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit, except that ExxonMobil shall perform a Cylinder Gas Audit (CGA) or Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA) which meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix F, within eight (8) hours of when the Coker unit flue gases begin exhausting through the Coker CO Boiler stack. ExxonMobil shall perform an annual Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) on the CEMS and notify EPA in writing of each annual RATA a minimum of 25 working days prior to actual testing.
              (C) Beginning on May 21, 2008, ExxonMobil shall operate and maintain a continuous stack flow rate monitor to measure the stack gas flow rates in the Coker CO Boiler stack. Whenever ExxonMobil's Coker unit is operating and Coker unit flue gases are exhausted through the Coker CO Boiler stack, this CEMS shall be operational and shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) flow rate measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and meet the Stack Gas Flow Rate Monitor Performance Specifications of section 6(D) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit, except that ExxonMobil shall perform an annual Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) on the CEMS and notify EPA in writing of each annual RATA a minimum of 25 working days prior to actual testing.
              (D) SO2 emissions from the Coker CO Boiler stack shall be determined in accordance with the equations in sections 2(A)(1), (8), (11)(a), and (16) of ExxonMobil's 1998 exhibit.

              (h) Flare compliance determining method. (1) Compliance with the emission limits in paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (e)(2)(i), (f)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(i) of this section shall be determined by measuring the total sulfur concentration and volumetric flow rate of the gas stream to the flare(s) (corrected to one (1) atmosphere pressure and 68 °F) and using the methods contained in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section. The volumetric flow rate of the gas stream to the flare(s) shall be determined in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (h)(2) of this section and the total sulfur concentration of the gas stream to the flare(s) shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
              (2) Flare flow monitoring: (i) Within 365 days after receiving EPA approval of the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section, each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall install and calibrate, and, thereafter, calibrate, maintain and operate, a continuous flow monitoring system capable of measuring the volumetric flow of the gas stream to the flare(s) in accordance with the specifications contained in paragraphs (h)(2)(iii) through (vi) of this section. The flow monitoring system shall require more than one flow monitoring device or flow measurements at more than one location if one monitor cannot measure the total volumetric flow to each flare.

              (ii) Volumetric flow monitors meeting the proposed volumetric flow monitoring specifications below should be able to measure the majority of volumetric flow in the gas streams to the flare. However, in rare events (e.g., upset conditions) the flow to the flare may exceed the range of the monitor. In such cases, or when the volumetric flow monitor or monitors are not working, other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate to the flare, which shall then be used to calculate SO2 emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when these other methods are used.

              (iii) The flare gas stream volumetric flow rate shall be measured on an actual wet basis, converted to Standard Conditions, and reported in SCFH. The minimum detectable velocity of the flow monitoring device(s) shall be 0.1 feet per second (fps). The flow monitoring device(s) shall continuously measure the range of flow rates corresponding to velocities from 0.5 to 275 fps and have a manufacturer's specified accuracy of ±5% of the measured flow over the range of 1.0 to 275 fps and ±20% of the measured flow over the range of 0.1 to 1.0 fps. The volumetric flow monitor(s) shall feature automated daily calibrations at low and high ranges. The volumetric flow monitor(s) shall be calibrated annually according to manufacturer's specifications.
              (iv) For correcting flow rate to standard conditions (defined as 68 °F and 760 mm, or 29.92 inches, of Hg), temperature and pressure shall be monitored continuously. Temperature and pressure shall be monitored in the same location as volumetric flow, and the temperature and pressure monitors shall be calibrated prior to installation according to manufacturer's specifications and, thereafter, annually to meet accuracy specifications as follows: The temperature monitor shall be calibrated to within ±2.0% at absolute temperature and the pressure monitor shall be calibrated to within ±5.0 mmHg;
              (v) The flow monitoring device(s) shall be calibrated prior to installation to demonstrate accuracy of the measured flow to within 5.0% at flow rates equivalent to 30%, 60%, and 90% of monitor full scale.
              (vi) Each volumetric flow device shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) flow rate measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and be installed in a manner and at a location that will allow for accurate measurements of the total volume of the gas stream going to each flare. Each temperature and pressure monitoring device shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and be installed in a manner that will allow for accurate measurements.
              (vii) In addition to the continuous flow monitors, facilities may use flare water seal monitoring devices to determine whether there is flow going to the flare. If used, owners or operators shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain these devices according to manufacturer's specifications. The devices shall include a continuous monitoring system that:
              (A) Monitors the status of the water seal to indicate when flow is going to the flare;
              (B) Automatically records the time and duration when flow is going to the flare; and
              (C) Verifies that the physical seal has been restored after flow has been sent to the flare.
              If the water seal monitoring devices indicate that there is no flow going to the flare, yet the continuous flow monitor is indicating flow, the presumption will be that no flow is going to the flare.
              (viii) Each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section, that does not certify that only natural gas or an inert gas is used for both the pilot gas and purge gas, shall determine the volumetric flow of each pilot gas and purge gas stream for which natural gas or inert gas is not used by one of the following methods:

              (A) Measure the volumetric flow of the gas using continuous flow monitoring devices on an actual wet basis, converted to Standard Conditions, and reported in SCFH. Each flow monitoring device shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) flow rate measurement per minute, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, and be installed in a manner and at a location that will allow for accurate measurements of the total volume of the gas. Gas flow rate monitor accuracy determinations shall be required at least once every 48 months or more frequently at routine refinery turn-around. In cases when the flow monitoring device or devices are not working or the range of the monitoring device(s) is exceeded, other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine volumetric flow of the gas which shall then be used to calculate SO2 emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when other methods are used; or
              (B) Use parameters and methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section to calculate the volumetric flows of the gas, in SCFH.
              (3) Flare concentration monitoring: (i) Within 365 days after receiving EPA approval of the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section, each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall determine the total sulfur concentration of the gas stream to the flare(s) using either continuous total sulfur analyzers or grab or integrated sampling with lab analysis, as described in the following paragraphs:
              (A) Continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring. If a facility chooses to use continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring, the following requirements apply:
              (1) The facility shall install and calibrate, and, thereafter, calibrate, maintain and operate, a continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring system capable of measuring the total sulfur concentration of the gas stream to each flare. Continuous monitoring shall occur at a location or locations that are representative of the gas combusted in the flare and be capable of measuring the normally expected range of total sulfur in the gas stream to the flare. The concentration monitoring system shall require more than one concentration monitoring device or concentration measurements at more than one location if one monitor cannot measure the total sulfur concentration to each flare. Total sulfur concentration shall be reported as H2S or SO2 in ppm. In cases when the total sulfur analyzer or analyzers are not working or the concentration of the total sulfur exceeds the range of the analyzer(s), other methods, approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section, shall be used to determine total sulfur concentrations, which shall then be used to calculate SO2 emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when these other methods are used.
              (2) The total sulfur analyzer(s) shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) concentration measurement per 15 minutes, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, be installed, certified (on a concentration basis), and operated in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 5, and be subject to and meet the quality assurance and quality control requirements (on a concentration basis) of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix F.
              (3) Each affected facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall notify the Air Program Contact at EPA's Montana Operations Office, Federal Building, 10 West 15th Street, Suite 3200, Helena, MT 59626, in writing of each Relative Accuracy Test Audit a minimum of 25 working days prior to the actual testing.

              (B) Grab or integrated total sulfur concentration monitoring: If a facility chooses grab or integrated sampling instead of continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring, the facility shall comply with the methods specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(1) (“Grab Sampling”) or (h)(3)(B)(i)(B)(2) (“Integrated Sampling”), and the requirements of paragraphs (h)(3)(i)(B)(3) (“Sample Analysis”), (h)(3)(i)(B)(4) (“Exemptions”), and (h)(3)(i)(B)(5) (“Missing or Unanalyzed Sample”) of this section, as follows:
              (1) Grab Sampling. Each facility that chooses to use grab sampling shall meet the following requirements: if the flow rate of the gas stream to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period continuously exceeds 0.5 feet per second (fps) and the water seal monitoring device, if any, indicates that flow is going to the flare, a grab sample shall be collected within 15 minutes. The grab sample shall be collected at a location that is representative of the gas combusted in the flare. Thereafter, the sampling frequency shall be one (1) grab sample every three (3) hours, which shall continue until the velocity of the gas stream going to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period is continuously 0.5 fps or less. Samples shall be analyzed according to paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(1) shall apply to each flare at a facility for which the sampling threshold is exceeded.
              (2) Integrated Sampling. Each facility that chooses to use integrated sampling shall meet the following requirements: if the flow rate of the gas stream to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period continuously exceeds 0.5 feet per second (fps) and the water seal monitoring device, if any, indicates that flow is going to the flare, a sample shall be collected within 15 minutes. The sample shall be collected at a location that is representative of the gas combusted in the flare. The sampling frequency, thereafter, shall be a minimum of one (1) aliquot for each 15-minute period until the sample container is full, or until the end of a 3-hour period is reached, whichever comes sooner. Within 30 minutes thereafter, a new sample container shall be placed in service, and sampling on this frequency, and in this manner, shall continue until the velocity of the gas stream going to the flare in any consecutive 15-minute period is continuously 0.5 fps or less. Samples shall be analyzed according to paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(2) shall apply to each flare at a facility for which the sampling threshold is exceeded.
              (3) Samples shall be analyzed using ASTM Method D4468-85 (Reapproved 2000) “Standard Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and Rateometric Colorimetry,” (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) ASTM Method D5504-01 (Reapproved 2006) “Standard Test Method for Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence,” (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (j) of this section) or 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A-5, Method 15A “Determination of Total Reduced Sulfur Emissions From the Sulfur Recovery Plants in Petroleum Refineries.” Total sulfur concentration shall be reported as H2S or SO2 in ppm.
              (4) Exemptions. For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(1) (“Grab Sampling”) or (h)(3)(i)(B)(2) (“Integrated Sampling”) of this section, obtaining a sample is not required if flaring is a result of a catastrophic or other unusual event, including a major fire or an explosion at the facility, such that collecting a sample at the EPA-approved location during the relevant period is infeasible or constitutes a safety hazard, provided that the owner or operator shall collect a sample at an alternative location if feasible, safe, and representative of the flaring event. The owner or operator shall demonstrate to EPA that it was infeasible or unsafe to collect a sample or to collect a sample at the sampling location approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section. The owner or operator shall also demonstrate to EPA that any sample collected at an alternative location is representative of the flaring incident. If a facility experiences ongoing difficulties collecting grab or integrated samples in accordance with its flare monitoring plan approved by EPA pursuant to paragraph (h)(5) of this section, EPA may require the facility to revise its flare monitoring plan and use continuous total sulfur concentration monitoring as described in paragraph (h)(3)(i)(A) of this section or other reliable method to determine total sulfur concentrations of the gas stream to the flare.
              (5) Missing or Unanalyzed Samples. For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(1) (“Grab Sampling”) or (h)(3)(i)(B)(2) (“Integrated Sampling”) of this section, if a required sample is not obtained or analyzed for any reason, other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine total sulfur concentrations, which shall then be used to calculate SO2 emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when these other methods are used.
              (6) Reporting. For facilities using a sampling method specified in either paragraph (h)(3)(i)(B)(1) (“Grab Sampling”) or (h)(3)(i)(B)(2) (“Integrated Sampling”) of this section, since normally only one (1) sample per flare will be analyzed for a 3-hour period, the total sulfur concentration of a sample obtained during a given 3-hour period shall be substituted for each hour of such 3-hour period. If integrated sampling for a flare produces more than one (1) sample container during a 3-hour period, and the gas in each container is analyzed separately, the concentrations for the containers shall be averaged. For that flare, the resulting average shall be substituted for each hour of the 3-hour period during which the sampling occurred. The substituted hourly total sulfur concentrations determined per this paragraph shall be used to determine hourly emissions from the flare.

              (ii) Each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section that does not certify that only natural gas or an inert gas is used for both the pilot gas and purge gas shall determine the H2S concentration of each pilot gas and purge gas stream for which natural gas or inert gas is not used by one of the following methods:
              (A) Measure the H2S concentration of the gas by continuous H2S analyzer. The H2S concentration analyzer(s) shall achieve a temporal sampling resolution of at least one (1) concentration measurement per three (3) minutes, meet the requirements expressed in the definition of “hourly average” in paragraph (c)(14) of this section, be installed, certified (on a concentration basis), and operated in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, Appendix B, Performance Specification 2, and be subject to and meet the quality assurance and quality control requirements (on a concentration basis) of 40 CFR part 60, Appendix F. In cases where the H2S analyzer or analyzers are not working or the H2S concentration exceeds the range of the analyzer(s), other methods approved by EPA in the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall be used to determine the H2S concentration of the gas, which shall then be used to calculate SO2 emissions. In quarterly reports, sources shall indicate when other methods are used; or

              (B) Use methods approved by EPA as part of the facility's flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section to estimate the H2S concentration of the gas.
              (4) Calculation of SO
                2
                emissions from flares. Methods for calculating hourly and 3-hour SO2 emissions from flares shall be submitted to EPA as part of the flare monitoring plan required by paragraph (h)(5) of this section. Following approval by EPA, such methods shall be followed for calculating hourly and 3-hour SO2 emissions from a facility's flare(s).
              (5) By October 20, 2008, each facility named in paragraph (a) of this section shall submit a flare monitoring plan. Each flare monitoring plan shall include, at a minimum, the following:

              (i) Affirmative defense provisions for exceedances of flare emission limits during malfunctions, startups, and shutdowns. (1) In response to an action to enforce the emission limits in paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (e)(2)(i), (f)(2)(i), and (g)(2)(i) of this section, owners and/or operators of the facilities named in paragraph (a) of this section may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such limits during periods of malfunction, startup, or shutdown. To establish the affirmative defense and to be relieved of a civil penalty in any action to enforce such a limit, the owner or operator of the facility must meet the notification requirements of paragraph (i)(2) of this section in a timely manner and prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
              (i) For claims of malfunction:

              (B) The excess emissions:
              (1) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
              (2) Could not have been avoided by better operation and maintenance practices;
              (C) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable;
              (D) The amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;
              (ii) For claims of startup or shutdown:
              (A) All or a portion of the facility was in startup or shutdown mode, resulting in the need to route gases to the flare;
              (B) The periods of excess emissions that occurred during startup and shutdown were short and infrequent and could not have been prevented through careful planning and design or better operation and maintenance practices; and
              (C) The frequency and duration of operation in startup or shutdown mode were minimized to the maximum extent practicable;
              (iii) For claims of malfunction, startup, or shutdown:
              (A) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
              (B) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality;
              (C) All emissions monitoring systems were kept in operation if at all possible;
              (D) The owner or operator's actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;
              (E) The excess emissions were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;
              (F) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and

              (G) During the period of excess emissions, there were no exceedances of the SO2 NAAQS that could be attributed to the emitting source.

                and NO
                X—(1) CEMS for EGUs. At all times after the compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate, and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR part 75, to accurately measure SO2, NOX, diluent, and stack gas volumetric flow rate from each unit. The CEMS shall be used by the owner/operator to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit.
              (2) Method for EGUs. (i) For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average SO2 and NOX concentration in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 75. At the end of each boiler operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current boiler operating day and the previous 29 successive boiler operating days.
              (ii) An hourly average SO2 or NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 75, is acquired by the owner/operator for both the pollutant concentration monitor (SO2 or NOX) and the diluent monitor (O2 or CO2).
              (iii) Data reported by the owner/operator to meet the requirements of this section shall not include data substituted using the missing data substitution procedures of subpart D of 40 CFR part 75, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of 40 CFR part 75.
              (3) CEMS for cement kilns. At all times after the compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate, and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR 60.63(f) and (g), to accurately measure concentration by volume of SO2 and NOX emissions into the atmosphere from each unit. The CEMS shall be used by the owner/operator to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit, in combination with data on actual clinker production. The owner/operator must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected unit is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).
              (4) Method for cement kilns. (i) The owner/operator of each unit shall record the daily clinker production rates.

              (ii) The owner/operator of each unit shall calculate and record the 30-operating day rolling emission rates of SO2 and NOX, in lb/ton of clinker produced, as the total of all hourly emissions data for the cement kiln in the preceding 30 days, divided by the total tons of clinker produced in that kiln during the same 30-day operating period, using the following equation:
              
                ER18SE12.069

                Ci = Concentration of NOX or SO2 for hour i, ppm;
                Qi = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas for hour i, where
                Ci and Qi are on the same basis (either wet or dry), scf/hr;
                Pi = total kiln clinker produced during production hour i, ton/hr;
                k = conversion factor, 1.194 × 10−7 for NOX and 1.660 × 10−7 for SO2; and
                n = number of kiln operating hours over 30 kiln operating days, n = 1 to 720.
              
              
              For each kiln operating hour for which the owner/operator does not have at least one valid 15-minute CEMS data value, the owner/operator must use the average emissions rate (lb/hr) from the most recent previous hour for which valid data are available. Hourly clinker production shall be determined by the owner/operator in accordance with the requirements found at 40 CFR 60.63(b).
              (iii) At the end of each kiln operating day, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/ton clinker from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates for the current kiln operating day and the previous 29 successive kiln operating days.
              (f) Compliance determinations for particulate matter—(1) EGU particulate matter BART emission limits. Compliance with the particulate matter BART emission limits for each EGU BART unit shall be determined by the owner/operator from annual performance stack tests. Within 60 days of the compliance deadline specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and on at least an annual basis thereafter, the owner/operator of each unit shall conduct a stack test on each unit to measure the particulate emissions using EPA Method 5, 5B, 5D, or 17, as appropriate, in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A test shall consist of three runs, with each run at least 120 minutes in duration and each run collecting a minimum sample of 60 dry standard cubic feet. Results shall be reported by the owner/operator in lb/MMBtu. The results from a stack test meeting the requirements of this paragraph (f)(1) that was completed within 12 months prior to the compliance deadline can be used in lieu of the first stack test required. If this option is chosen, then the next annual stack test shall be due no more than 12 months after the stack test that was used. In addition to annual stack tests, owner/operator shall monitor particulate emissions for compliance with the BART emission limits in accordance with the applicable Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) plan developed and approved in accordance with 40 CFR part 64.
              (2) Cement kiln particulate matter BART emission limits. Compliance with the particulate matter BART emission limits for each cement kiln shall be determined by the owner/operator from annual performance stack tests. Within 60 days of the compliance deadline specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and on at least an annual basis thereafter, the owner/operator of each unit shall conduct a stack test on each unit to measure particulate matter emissions using EPA Method 5, 5B, 5D, or 17, as appropriate, in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A test shall consist of three runs, with each run at least 120 minutes in duration and each run collecting a minimum sample of 60 dry standard cubic feet. The average of the results of three test runs shall be used by the owner/operator for demonstrating compliance. The results from a stack test meeting the requirements of this paragraph (f)(2) that was completed within 12 months prior to the compliance deadline can be used in lieu of the first stack test required. If this option is chosen, then the next annual stack test shall be due no more than 12 months after the stack test that was used. Clinker production shall be determined in accordance with the requirements found at 40 CFR 60.63(b). Results of each test shall be reported by the owner/operator as the average of three valid test runs. In addition to annual stack tests, owner/operator shall monitor particulate emissions for compliance with the BART emission limits in accordance with the applicable Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) plan developed and approved in accordance with 40 CFR part 64.
              (i) For Ash Grove Cement, the emission rate of particulate matter shall be computed by the owner/operator for each run in pounds per hour (lb/hr).

              (ii) For Trident, the emission rate (E) of particulate matter shall be computed by the owner/operator for each run in lb/ton clinker, using the following equation:
              
              E = (CsQs)/PK
              
              
                Where:
                
                E = emission rate of PM, lb/ton of clinker produced;
                Cs = concentration of PM in grains per standard cubic foot (gr/scf);
                Qs = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, where Cs and Qs are on the same basis (either wet or dry), scf/hr;
                P = total kiln clinker production, tons/hr; and
                K = conversion factor, 7,000 gr/lb.

              § 52.1398
              Control strategy: Sulfur dioxide.
              (a) Redesignation to attainment. The EPA has determined that the Billings 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO2) nonattainment area has met the criteria under CAA section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment for the 2010 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. The EPA is therefore redesignating the Billings 2010 SO2 nonattainment area to attainment.

              (b) The EPA is approving the maintenance plan for the Billings nonattainment area for the 2010 SO2 NAAQS submitted by the State of Montana on December 14, 2015.

              § 52.1423
              PM 10 State implementation plan development in group II areas.
              The state of Nebraska committed to conform to the PM10 regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 51. In a letter to Morris Kay, EPA, dated February 5, 1988, Mr. Dennis Grams, Director, Nebraska Department of Environmental Control, stated:

              (a) An area in the City of Omaha and the area in and around the Village of Weeping Water have been classified as Group II areas for the purpose of PM10 State Implementation Plan (SIP) development. The specific boundaries of these areas are identified in our letter of October 6, 1987, to Carl Walter. In accordance with the requirements for PM10 SIP development, the State of Nebraska commits to perform the following PM10 monitoring and SIP development activities for these Group II areas:
              (1) Gather ambient PM10 data, at least to the extent consistent with minimum EPA requirements and guidance.
              (2) Analyze and verify the ambient PM10 data and report 24-hour exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for PM10 to the Regional Office within 45 days of each exceedance.

              (3) When an appropriate number of verifiable exceedances of the 24-hour standard occur, calculated according to section 2.0 of the PM10 SIP Development Guideline, or when an exceedance of the annual PM10 standard occurs, acknowledge that a nonattainment problem exists and immediately notify the Regional Office.

              (4) Within 30 days of the notification referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, or within 37 months of promulgation of the PM10 standards, whichever comes first, determine whether measures in the existing SIP will assure timely attainment and maintenance of the PM10 standards and immediately notify the Regional Office.

              (5) Within 6 months of the notification referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, adopt and submit to EPA a PM10 control strategy that assures attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than 3 years from approval of the committal SIP.

              An emission inventory will be compiled for the identified Group II areas. If either area is found to be violating the PM10 standards, the inventory will be completed as part of the PM10 SIP for that area on a schedule consistent with that outlined in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5. If the PM10 standards are not violated, the inventory will be completed not later than July 1, 1989, and submitted to EPA not later than August 31, 1990, as part of the determination of adequacy of the current SIP to attain and maintain the PM10 air quality standards.
              (b) We request that the total suspended particulate nonattainment areas in Omaha and Weeping Water (all secondary nonattainment) and Louisville (Primary nonattainment) be redesignated to unclassifiable.

              § 52.1424
              Operating permits.
              Emission limitations and related provisions which are established in Nebraska operating permits as Federally enforceable conditions shall be enforceable by EPA. The EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not Federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures and be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirement which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements or the requirements of EPA underlying regulations.

              General requirements.
              (a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met in Washoe County, since the plan does not provide procedures for making emission data, as correlated with allowable emissions, available to the public. In addition, Chapter 020.065 of the “Air Pollution Control Regulations” of the District Board of Health of Washoe County in the Northwest Nevada Intrastate Region is disapproved since it contains provisions which restrict the public availability of emission data as correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures.
              (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
              (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
              (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.

              (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

              (a) Approval—On February 1, 1999, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan to remove the Nashua Inspection/Maintenance program for carbon monoxide that ceased operating on January 1, 1995. The Nashua Inspection/Maintenance was originally approved at § 52.1520(c)(39). The Nashua Inspection/Maintenance program was replaced with controls consisting of the existing federal Tier 1 emission standards for new vehicles and the federal reformulated gasoline program.
              (b) Approval—On February 2, 1999, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted a request to redesignate the City of Manchester carbon monoxide nonattainment area to attainment for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1990 attainment year) emission inventory for carbon monoxide, a demonstration of maintenance of the carbon monoxide NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2010 for carbon monoxide, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit additional information in eight years acknowledging that the maintenance plan will remain in effect through the year 2020, as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the carbon monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), New Hampshire will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes the enhanced safety inspection program and New Hampshire's low emission vehicle program (NLEV) as contingency measures. The redesignation request establishes a motor vehicle emissions budget of 55.83 tons per day for carbon monoxide to be used in determining transportation conformity for the Manchester area. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively.

              (c) Approval—On February 2, 1999, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted a request to redesignate the City of Nashua carbon monoxide nonattainment area to attainment for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1990 attainment year) emission inventory for carbon monoxide, a demonstration of maintenance of the carbon monoxide NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2010 for carbon monoxide, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit additional information in eight years acknowledging that the maintenance plan will remain in effect through the year 2020, as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the carbon monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), New Hampshire will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes the enhanced safety inspection program and New Hampshire's low emission vehicle program (NLEV) as contingency measures. The redesignation request establishes a motor vehicle emissions budget of 60.13 tons per day for carbon monoxide to be used in determining transportation conformity for the Nashua area. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively.
              (d) Approval—On May 30, 2007, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted a modification to the Nashua maintenance plan approved in paragraph (c) of this section. New Hampshire will not conduct CO monitoring in Nashua, but instead commits to continue to collect and review CO monitoring data from nearby Manchester, NH on an on-going basis. In the event the second highest CO concentration in any calendar year monitored in Manchester reaches 75 percent of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour national ambient air quality standard for CO, New Hampshire will, within 9 months of recording such concentrations, re-establish a CO monitoring site in Nashua consistent with EPA siting criteria, and resume analyzing and reporting those data. New Hampshire commits to implement its contingency program in Nashua in the event that a CO violation is monitored at the re-established Nashua monitoring site at any time during the maintenance period. If the Manchester CO monitor measures a violation of the either the federal 1-hour or 8-hour NAAQS for CO, contingency measures will be implemented in Nashua as well, until a re-established CO monitor in Nashua shows that the area is in attainment of the CO standard.
              (e) Approval—On August 1, 2012, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services submitted modifications to the Manchester and Nashua maintenance plans approved in paragraph (b) and (c) respectively of this section. The Manchester and Nashua current carbon monoxide maintenance plans are both converted to limited maintenance plans for the remainder of their second-ten year maintenance periods which terminate on January 29, 2021. Future carbon monoxide transportation conformity evaluations for Manchester and Nashua will for the length of their limited maintenance plans be considered to satisfy the regional emissions analysis and “budget test” requirements. In addition, New Hampshire will no longer conduct CO monitoring in Manchester, New Hampshire as addressed in paragraph (d) of this section. The Manchester monitoring site is replaced with the Londonderry Moose Hill station in Londonderry, New Hampshire with triggers to reestablish CO monitoring sites in Manchester and Nashua if elevated CO levels are recorded in Londonderry.

              § 52.1533
              Emission inventories.
              (a) The Governor's designee for the State of New Hampshire submitted a 1990 base year emission inventory for the entire state on January 26, 1993 as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). Subsequent revisions to the State's 1990 inventories were made, the last of which occurred on August 29, 1996. The 1990 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for the three nonattainment areas in the State. The three areas are the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester serious area, the New Hampshire portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester serious area, and the Manchester marginal area.
              (b) The inventory is for the ozone precursors which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventory covers point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources.
              (c) The Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester serious nonattainment area includes all of Strafford County and part of Rockingham County. The New Hampshire portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester serious area includes portions of Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties. The Manchester marginal area contains all of Merrimack County and portions of Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties.

              § 52.1534
              Control strategy: Ozone.
              (a) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services on September 27, 1996. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(c)(2)(B), and the contingency measure requirements of section 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, for the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester serious area, and the New Hampshire portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester serious area.

              (b) Approval—Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Protection on June 1, 1998. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the one-hour ozone attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes a one-hour attainment date of November 15, 2007 for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets of 10.72 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 21.37 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity in the New Hampshire portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area.
              (c) Determination of Attainment. Effective March 18, 2008, EPA is determining that the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.

              (d) Approval—Revision to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services on May 28, 2008. This revision establishes Year 2009 motor vehicle emission budgets of 15.31 tons per summer day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 28.53 tons per summer day of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to be used in transportation conformity in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.

              (e) Determination of Attainment. Effective April 18, 2011, EPA is determining that the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard based on 2007-2009 monitoring data. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply. In addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 ozone standard.
              (f) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective June 28, 2012, EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area.
              (g) Determination of Attainment. Effective November 29, 2012, EPA is determining that the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 1999, based on 1997-1999 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Portsmouth-Dover-Rochester serious one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard since 1999 and continues to attain based on complete, quality-assured data ozone monitoring data through 2011.
              (h) Determination of Attainment. Effective November 29, 2012, EPA is determining that the Manchester one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 1993, based on 1991-1993 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Manchester marginal one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard, since 1993, and that it continues to attain based on complete quality-assured ozone monitoring data through 2011.

              (i) Approval—EPA is approving a redesignation request for the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire moderate 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. New Hampshire submitted this request on March 2, 2012, and supplemented this submittal on September 21, 2012. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone maintenance plan also establishes 2008 and 2022 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the area. New Hampshire is establishing 2008 MVEBs of 17.8 tons per summer weekday (tpswd) of VOC and 37.2 tpswd of NOX, for the Boston-Manchester-Portsmouth (SE), New Hampshire 1997 8-hour ozone maintenance area. In addition, New Hampshire is establishing MVEBs for 2022 at 9.2 tpswd of VOC and 11.8 tpswd of NOX, for the same area. The 2008 and 2022 MVEBs were prepared with the MOVES model. Previously SIP-approved 2009 MVEBs prepared with MOBILE6.2 are being withdrawn. Finally, EPA is also approving a comprehensive 2008 emission inventory for this area.

              (j) Approval—EPA is approving the Clean Air Act section 110(a)(1) maintenance plan for the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard in the area of the New Hampshire required to have such a plan. This area includes portions of Hillsborough, Merrimack, Rockingham, and Strafford Counties, and all of Cheshire County. This maintenance plan was submitted to EPA on March 2, 2012.

              § 52.1572
              Extensions.
              Pursuant to section 186(a)(4) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, the Regional Administrator hereby extends for one year (until December 31, 1996) the attainment date for the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Carbon Monoxide nonattainment area.

              § 52.1573
              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves New Jersey's plans for attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, except as noted below in § 52.1581. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January, 1978 and January, 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
              (b) Visibility protection. EPA approves the Regional Haze SIP revision submitted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection on July 28, 2009, as supplemented on December 9, 2010, March 2, 2011 and December 7, 2011 as meeting the requirements of Clean Air Act section 169A and 40 CFR 51.308. In particular, EPA approves the New Jersey Regional Haze SIP as meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(e) regarding Best Available Retrofit Technology and 40 CFR 51.308(d)(2) and (d)(4)(v) regarding the calculation of baseline and natural conditions for the Brigantine Wilderness Area of the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, and the statewide inventory of emissions of pollutants that are reasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment in any mandatory Class I Federal Area.

              Determinations of attainment.
              (a) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2008 to 2010, EPA determined that Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area (the Philadelphia Area) attained the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Philadelphia Area nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

              (b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2007 to 2009, EPA determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE fine particle (PM2.5) nonattainment area attained the 1997 annual PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of April 5, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 179(c) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE PM2.5 nonattainment area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).
              (c) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the three-year period 2005 to 2007, EPA determined, as of June 18, 2012, that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of November 15, 2007. Separate from and independent of this determination, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area, and data for 2011, EPA determined, as of June 18, 2012, that the NY-NJ-CT one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard.
              (d) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2013 to 2015, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE marginal ozone nonattainment area has attained the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of July 20, 2016. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE marginal ozone nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date pursuant to section 181(b)(2)(A).

              Compliance schedules.
              (a) [Reserved]
              (b) The requirements of § 51.261 of this chapter are not met since Chapter 7, section 7.1(c) of New Jersey's “Air Pollution Control Code” permits certain sources to defer compliance with Chapter 7 until after the required date for attainment of the national standards for particulate matter.
              (c) The requirements of § 51.262(a) of this chapter are not met since Chapter 7 of New Jersey's “Air Pollution Control Code” does not provide for periodic increments of progress toward compliance for those sources with compliance schedules extending over a period of 18 or more months.
              (d) Regulation for increments of progress. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of any stationary source in the State of New Jersey to which an exception extending beyond January 31, 1974, is applicable under Chapter 7, section 7.1(c) of the New Jersey Air Pollution Control Code shall, no later than 120 days following the effective date of this paragraph, submit to the Administrator for approval, a proposed compliance schedule that demonstrates compliance with the emission limitations prescribed by Chapter 7 of the New Jersey Air Pollution Control Code as expeditiously as practicable but no later than July 31, 1975. The compliance schedule shall provide for periodic increments of progress towards compliance. The dates for achievement of such increments shall be specified. Increments of progress shall include, but not be limited to: Submittal of the final control plan to the Administrator; letting of necessary contracts for construction or process changes or issuance of orders for the purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control or process modification; initiation of onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process change; completion of onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process modification; and final compliance.
              (2) Where any such owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that compliance with the applicable regulations will be achieved on or before January 31, 1974, no compliance schedule shall be required.
              (3) Any owner or operator required to submit a compliance schedule pursuant to this paragraph shall within 5 days after the deadline for each increment of progress, certify to the Administrator whether or not the required increment of the approved compliance schedule has been met.
              (4) Any compliance schedule adopted by the State and approved by the Administrator shall satisfy the requirements of this paragraph for the affected source.

              Review of new sources and modifications.

              (a) Subchapter 18 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled, “Control and Prohibitions of Air Pollution from Ambient Air Quality in Nonattainment Areas (Emission Offset Rule),” N.J.A.C. 7:27-18.1 et seq., as submitted to EPA on August 5, 1980 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, is approved for the entire State of New Jersey, with the following provisions:
              (1) The definition of “significant emission increase” as it appears in section 7:27-18.1, entitled, “Definitions,” is disapproved. The following definition of “significant emission increase” is applicable: “An increase, since December 21, 1976, in the rate of allowable emissions, including fugitive pollutant emissions, at a facility of any criteria pollutant greater than or equal to 50 tons per year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour, not including decreases in the rates of allowable emissions except where such decreases are contemporaneous with emission increases. The increase in the rates of allowable emissions shall be the cumulative total of increases from all new or altered equipment for which permits have been issued on or after December 21, 1976 and for which permit applications have been received by the Department, and the fugitive emissions associated with that equipment. The hourly and daily rates shall apply only with respect to a pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard for a period not exceeding 24 hours has been established.
              (2) Subsection (e)(1) under section 7:27-18.2, entitled, “General Provisions,” is disapproved and replaced with the following: “The requirements of paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section shall again become applicable when proposed new construction or alterations at the facility would cause the increase in the rate of allowable emissions of that criteria pollutant to again exceed 50 tons per year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour whichever is most restrictive. The accumulation of increases in the rate of allowable emissions shall resume from zero after each application of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.”

              § 52.1580
              Conditional approval.
              (a) Enhanced inspection and maintenance. (1) The State of New Jersey's March 27, 1996 submittal for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as amended on November 27, 1996 and April 22, 1997, is conditionally approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim period to last 18 months. If New Jersey fails to start its program by November 15, 1997, the interim approval granted under the provisions of the NHSDA, which EPA believes allows the State to take full credit in its 15 percent plan for all of the emission reduction credits in its proposal, will convert to a disapproval after a finding letter is sent to the State by EPA. If the State fails to submit to EPA the final modeling demonstrating that its program will meet the relevant enhanced I/M performance standard by February 1, 1998, the conditional approval will automatically convert to a disapproval as explained under Section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act.
              (2) In addition to the above condition, the State must correct eight minor, or de minimis, deficiencies related to the CAA requirements for enhanced I/M. The minor deficiencies are listed in EPA's conditional interim final rulemaking on New Jersey's motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program published on May 14, 1997. Although satisfaction of these deficiencies does not affect the conditional interim approval status of the State's rulemaking, these deficiencies must be corrected in the final I/M SIP revision to be submitted at the end of the 18-month interim period.
              (3) EPA is also approving this SIP revision under Section 110(k), for its strengthening effect on the plan.

              Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.
              (a) Approval—The September 28, 1995 revision to the carbon monoxide state implementation plan for Camden County and the Nine not-classified areas (the city of Trenton, the City of Burlington, the Borough of Penns Grove (part), the Borough of Freehold, the City of Morristown, the City of Perth Amboy, the City of Toms River, the Borough of Somerville, and the City of Atlantic City). This revision included a maintenance plan which demonstrated continued attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for carbon monoxide through the year 2007.
              (b) The base year carbon monoxide emission inventory requirement of section 187(a)(1) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has been satisfied for the entire State. The inventory was submitted on November 15, 1992 and amended on September 28, 1995 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a revision to the carbon monoxide State Implementation Plan.
              (c) Approval—The November 15, 1992, October 4, 1993, and August 7, 1998 revisions to the carbon monoxide state implementation plan for the New Jersey portion of the New York—Northern New Jersey—Long Island Carbon Monoxide nonattainment area. This included an attainment demonstration and the control measures needed to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for carbon monoxide. The January 15, 2002, request to redesignate the New Jersey portion of the New York—Northern New Jersey—Long Island Carbon Monoxide nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan which demonstrated continued attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for carbon monoxide through the year 2014.
              (d) The 1997 and 2007 carbon monoxide motor vehicle emission budgets for Camden County and the Nine Not Classified Areas included in New Jersey's May 21, 2004 SIP revision are approved.

              (e)(1) Approval—The May 18, 2006 revision to the carbon monoxide maintenance plan for Camden County and the Nine Not Classified Areas. This revision contains a second ten-year maintenance plan that demonstrates continued attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for carbon monoxide through the year 2017.
              (2) The 2007 and 2014 carbon monoxide conformity emission budgets for five counties in the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island carbon monoxide maintenance area included in New Jersey's May 18, 2006 SIP revision are approved.
              (f) Approval—The June 11, 2015 and February 8, 2016 revisions to the carbon monoxide (CO) maintenance plan for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NYNNJLI, CO area.

              (a) Subchapter 16 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled “Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Volatile Organic Substances,” N.J.A.C. 7:27-16.1 et seq. as revised on December 31, 1981 and effective March 1, 1982, is approved with the following provisions and conditions:
              (1) Subsections 16.6(c)(4) and 16.6(c)(5) are approved. The State must comply with the public participation procedures it submitted to EPA on December 19, 1980 and must supply to EPA a copy of each notice of a proposed bubble that it supplies the public. In addition, the State must promptly transmit to EPA notice setting forth each set of emission limits approved by the state pursuant to subsections 16.6(c)(4) and 16.6(c)(5) as well as the emission limitations previously applicable. Finally, the State must transmit any relevant additional material EPA may request, and it must notify the public of an approved set of emission limits at the time it transmits notice of those limits to EPA.
              (2) Emission limitations required by subsections 16.5(a), 16.6(a) and 16.6(b) are applicable requirements of the New Jersey SIP for the purposes of section 113 of the Clean Air Act and shall be enforceable by EPA and by citizens in the same manner as other requirements of the SIP; except that emission limitations adopted by the State under and which comply with subsections 16.6(c) (4) and (5) shall be the applicable requirements of the New Jersey SIP in lieu of those contained in subsections 16.5(a), 16.6(a) and 16.6(b) and shall be enforceable by EPA and by citizens, if the State meets the requirements set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
              (3) Although EPA approves the variance provisions in subchapter 7:27-16.9 and 7:27-16.10, in order to be considered as part of the SIP, each variance issued under these provisions must be submitted to and approved by EPA as a SIP revision.
              (4) The December 17, 1979 version of Subchapter 16 is approved as a part of the SIP only to the extent that it addresses compliance dates for Group I Control Techniques Guideline source categories.
              (b) Subchapter 17 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled “Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Toxic Substances,” N.J.A.C. 7:27-17.1 et seq. as revised on October 17, 1979 and effective December 17, 1979, is approved for the regulation of perchloroethylene dry cleaners, as further clarified in a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection memorandum “Subchapter 17 Requirements for Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Systems” dated October 25, 1982.
              (c) The November 15, 1993 SIP revision submitted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy demonstrates the fulfillment of section 182(b)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act for states to adopt RACT regulations for all sources for which EPA has issued a CTG before enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act.

              (d)(1) The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has been satisfied for the Atlantic City, New York/ Northern New Jersey/Long Island, Philadelphia/Wilmington/ Trenton, and Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton areas of New Jersey. The inventory was submitted on November 15, 1993 and amended on November 21, 1994 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP). Revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory dated December 31, 1996 for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas of New Jersey have been approved. Revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory dated February 10, 1999 for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas of New Jersey have been approved.

              (6) The demonstration that emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled will not increase motor vehicle emissions and, therefore, offsetting measures are not necessary which was included in New Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas has been approved.

              (7) The enforceable commitments to: participate in the consultative process to address regional transport; adopt additional control measures as necessary to attain the ozone standard, meet rate of progress requirements, and eliminate significant contribution to nonattainment downwind; identify any reductions that are needed from upwind areas for the area to meet the ozone standard; and implement the Ozone Transport Commission NOX Memorandum of Understanding included in New Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas have been approved.
              (e) The State of New Jersey's March 27, 1996 submittal for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as amended on November 27, 1996 and April 1997, is approved pursuant to section 110 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410. However, since New Jersey failed to start its program by November 15, 1997, the interim approval granted under the provisions of Section 348 of the National Highway Systems Designation Act of 1995 (NHSDA), 23 U.S.C. 348, which allowed the State to take full credit in its 15 Percent ROP Plan for all the emission reduction credits in its proposal, converted to a disapproval when EPA sent finding letters to the State on December 12, 1997. The finding letters also informed the state that the underlying enhanced I/M program approval, pursuant to Section 110 of the Act, remained in effect as part of the federally enforceable SIP.
              (f) The State of New Jersey's June 5, 1998 submittal for the conversion of the inspection frequency of the current inspection and maintenance (I/M) program from annual to biennial in order to facilitate the upgrade of the existing state lanes to accommodate the testing equipment for the enhanced program has been approved by EPA. The State will be adding a gas cap inspection to the current I/M program, which will result in a net increase in overall emissions reductions.
              (g) The 15 Percent Rate of Progress (ROP) Plans and the recalculation of the 9 Percent ROP Plans included in the July 30, 1998 addendum and the February 10, 1999 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas have been approved.

              (7) The revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by New Jersey on August 31, 1998, October 16, 1998, and April 26, 2000 are approved. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act for the New Jersey portions of the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton and New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island severe ozone nonattainment areas. The revisions establish attainment dates of November 15, 2005 for the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment area and November 15, 2007 for the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island ozone nonattainment area. The revisions include the enforceable commitments for future actions associated with attainment of the 1-hour ozone national ambient air quality:
              (i) To adopt additional control measures by October 31, 2001 to meet the level of reductions identified by EPA for attainment of the 1-hour ozone standard;
              (ii) To submit revised State Implementation Plan and motor vehicle emissions budgets by October 31, 2001 if additional adopted measures affect the motor vehicle emissions inventory;
              (i)(1) The revised 1996, 2005 and 2007 motor vehicle emission inventories calculated using MOBILE6 included in New Jersey's April 8, 2003 State Implementation Plan revision is approved.

              (2) The 2005 conformity emission budgets for the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment area and the 2005 and 2007 conformity emission budgets for the New Jersey portion of the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island nonattainment area included in New Jersey's May 21, 2004 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
              (k)(1) The Statewide 2002 base year ozone precursor emission inventories included in New Jersey's May 18, 2006 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.

              (2) The revisions to the 2005 and 2007 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the New Jersey portion of the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island nonattainment area included in New Jersey's May 18, 2006 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
              
              (3) The conformity emission budgets for the McGuire Air Force Base included in New Jersey's May 18, 2006 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
              (l) Attainment Determination. EPA is determining that the 1-hour ozone nonattainment areas in New Jersey listed below have attained the 1-hour ozone standard on the date listed and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) (contingency measures) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to these areas.
              (1) Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton (consisting of Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, and Salem Counties) as of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined, as of November 15, 2005, the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the imposition of the section 185 penalty fees.

              (2) Atlantic City (consisting of Atlantic and Cape May Counties) as of January 6, 2010.
              
              (m)(1) The 2008 Reasonable Further Progress Plans and associated 2008 ozone projection year emission inventories for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
              (2) The contingency measures for failure to meet the 2008 RFP Plan milestones for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
              (3) The moderate area Reasonably Available Control Measure Analysis for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
              (4) The 2008 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment areas included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
              (5) The general conformity budgets for McGuire AFB and Lakehurst NAS included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision are approved.
              (6) The Statewide reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis for the 8-hour ozone standard included in the August 1, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved based on EPA's approval of the April 9, 2010 and April 21, 2010 SIP revisions.
              (n)(1) Attainment determination. EPA has determined, as of March 26, 2012, that based on 2008 to 2010 ambient air quality data, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

              (2) EPA has determined, as of June 18, 2012, that based on 2007 to 2009 complete, quality-assured and certified ambient air quality data, additional data showing continued attainment through 2011, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT, eight-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS.
              (o)(1) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.
              (2) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE nonattainment area included in New Jersey's October 29, 2007 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.
              (p) Rescission of clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012-2014 show the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Therefore, the EPA is rescinding the clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard only. The prior determination (see paragraph (n)(2)) is in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918. The prior determination suspended the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This rescission of the clean data determination will result in a SIP Call for a new ozone attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard, for this area only. If the revised plan is approved by the EPA as demonstrating reasonable further progress and attainment for the more stringent 2008 NAAQS by the Moderate area attainment date, and is approved by the EPA as containing adequate contingency measures for the 2008 NAAQS, then the plan would be deemed to have also satisfied requirements of the SIP Call associated with violations for the 1997 NAAQS.

              (b) Before any steam or electric power generating facility in Zone 3, as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:27-10.1, burning fuel oil on June 4, 1979, having a rated hourly gross heat input greater than 200,000,000 British Thermal Units (BTU's), and capable of burning coal without major reconstruction or construction, which facility was in operation prior to May 6, 1968, or group of such facilities having a combined rated hourly capacity greater than 450,000,000 BTU's may be permitted by the State to convert to the use of coal, the State shall submit to EPA a copy of the proposed permit together with an air quality analysis employing methodology acceptable to EPA. If EPA determines, on the basis of the submitted analysis, that the proposed coal conversion will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of air quality standards and will not be the cause for any Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increment to be exceeded, then the permit authorizing conversion may become effective immediately upon the publication of such a determination (as a Notice) in the Federal Register. If EPA determines that the submitted analysis is inadequate or that it shows that the proposed conversion will interfere with attainment or maintenance of air quality standards or cause any PSD increment to be exceeded, then EPA shall so inform the State of its determination, and the permit authorizing conversion shall not become effective and conversion shall not occur until an adequate analysis is submitted or, if necessary, until a control strategy revision which would require any necessary emission reductions is submitted by the State and placed into effect as an EPA approved revision to the implementation plan. In addition, this same procedure shall apply to any State permit applied for that would authorize a relaxation in the sulfur-in-coal limitation at any such facility, as defined above in this paragraph, having already been granted a permit to convert to coal.
              (c) The U.S. Gypsum Co. in Clark, New Jersey is permitted to burn fuel oil with a sulfur content of 2.0 percent, by weight, at either Boiler #1, #2 or #3 until March 31, 1985 or until Boiler #4 is ready to burn coal, whichever occurs first. Such oil burning must conform with New Jersey requirements and conditions as set forth in applicable regulations and administrative orders.

              (b) Approval—On February 25, 2008, New Jersey submitted a revision to its early PM2.5 implementation plan to revise the motor vehicle emissions budgets for the Mercer County, New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT, PM2.5 nonattainment area. The revised budgets, applicable to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, are as follows: 108 tons per year of direct PM2.5 and 5,056 tons per year of NOX.
              (c) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, as of December 15, 2010, that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT fine particle (PM2.5) nonattainment area has attained the 1997 PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as the area continues to attain the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (d) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, as of May 16, 2012, that the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE fine particle (PM2.5) nonattainment area has attained the 1997 PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as the area continues to attain the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (e) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, as of December 31, 2012, that the New York-N. New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT fine particle (PM2.5) nonattainment area has attained the 2006 PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard. This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as the area continues to attain the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (f) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, as of January 7, 2013, that based on 2008 to 2010 and 2009 to 2011 ambient air quality data, the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE fine particlulate (PM2.5) nonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). This determination suspends the requirements for the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE PM2.5 nonattainment area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS.

              (g) Approval—The maintenance plan submitted on December 26, 2012, and supplemented on May 3, 2013, for the 1997 PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard and the 2006 PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard for the New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT, PM2.5 nonattainment area and the New Jersey portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE, PM2.5 nonattainment area has been approved.

              Approval status.
              With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves New Mexico's state implementation plan under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all applicable requirements of Parts C and D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, except as noted below.

              (a) The revisions to the New Mexico SIP definition of “Subject to Regulation” at 20.2.74.7 (AZ)(2)(a) NMAC to implement the GHG Biomass Deferral as submitted on January 8, 2013 are disapproved.

              § 52.1623
              Conditional approval.
              (a) General Conformity. (1) A letter, dated April 22, 1998, from the Chief of Air Quality Bureau New Mexico Environment Department to the EPA Regional Office, commits the State to remove Section 110.C from its rule for making the State's rule consistent with Federal rule. Specifically, the letter states that:
              
              

                This letter is regarding our general conformity rule, 20 NMAC 2.98—Conformity of General Federal Actions to the State Implementation Plan. We have been reviewing paragraph 110.C under Section 110—Reporting Requirements. This is the paragraph in which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had submitted a comment of concern to EPA, during EPA's proposed/final approval period for our rule. This comment caused EPA to withdraw its approval. The FAA had commented that New Mexico was more stringent than EPA, since our rule does not apply to non-Federal agencies. Our analysis has determined that our inclusion of this paragraph may make our rule more stringent than EPA, and should not have been included. The paragraph had originally come from a STAPPA/ALAPCO model rule. New Mexico had never intended to be more stringent than EPA with regards to general conformity. Hence, the State commits to putting 20 NMAC 2.98 on our regulatory agenda and plan to delete this paragraph within one year from the Federal Register publication of final notice of conditional approval to New Mexico's general conformity SIP.
              
              
              (2) If the State ultimately fails to meet its commitment to remove this section from its rule within one year of publication of this conditional approval, then EPA's conditional action will automatically convert to a final disapproval.

              (a) Part D Approval. The Albuquerque/Bernalillo County carbon monoxide maintenance plan as adopted on April 13, 1995, meets the requirements of Section 172 of the Clean Air Act, and is therefore approved.
              (b) Approval—The Albuquerque/Bernalillo County carbon monoxide limited maintenance plan revision dated September 7, 2004, meets the requirements of section 172 of the Clean Air Act, and is therefore approved.

              Significant deterioration of air quality.

              (a) The plan submitted by the Governor of New Mexico on February 21, 1984 (as adopted by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board (NMEIB) on January 13, 1984), August 19, 1988 (as revised and adopted by the NMEIB on July 8, 1988), and July 16, 1990 (as revised and adopted by the NMEID on March 9, 1990), Air Quality Control Regulation 707—Permits, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and its Supplemental document, is approved as meeting the requirements of part C, Clean Air Act for preventing significant deterioration of air quality. Additionally, on November 2, 1988, EPA approved New Mexico's stack height regulation into the SIP (53 FR 44191), thereby satisfying the conditions of EPA's conditional approval of the State's PSD program on February 27, 1987 (52 FR 5964). Therefore, the conditional approval was converted to a full approval on July 15, 2011.
              (b) The requirements of section 160 through 165 of the Clean Air Act are not met for federally designated Indian lands. Therefore, the provisions of § 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable implementation plan, and are applicable to sources located on land under the control of Indian governing bodies.
              (c) The plan submitted by the Governor in paragraph (a) of this section for Prevention of Significant Deterioration is not applicable to Bernalillo County. Therefore, the following plan described below is applicable to sources located within the boundaries of Bernalillo County (including the City of Albuquerque). This plan, submitted by the Governor of New Mexico on April 14, 1989, August 7, 1989, May 1, 1990, May 17, 1993, May 24, 2006, August 16, 2010, and December 15, 2010 and respectively adopted on March 8, 1989, July 12, 1989, April 11, 1990, February 10, 1993, December 22, 2005, April 13, 2006, July 28, 2010, and December 10, 2010, by the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Air Quality Control Board, containing Part 61—Prevention of Significant Deterioration is approved as meeting the requirements of part C of the Clean Air Act for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.

              Rules and regulations.
              (a) Part D disapproval: The requirements of § 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the measurement provisions of Sections A, B.2, and B.3 of New Mexico Regulation 506 make these sections unenforceable. Therefore, Sections A, B.2, and B.3 of Regulation 506 are disapproved.
              (b) Regulation for measurement of emission limitations (particulate matter from nonferrous smelters). (1) This regulation applies to new and existing nonferrous smelters as they are defined in New Mexico Regulation 506. The requirements of this paragraph replace the requirements of Sections A, B.2, and B.3 of Regulation 506. All other requirements of Regulation 506 are approved as part of the plan.
              (2) No person owning or operating a new nonferrous smelter shall permit, cause, suffer, or allow particulate matter emissions to the atmosphere in excess of 0.03 grains per dry standard cubic foot (as defined in 40 CFR part 60) of discharge gas.
              (3) No person owning or operating an existing nonferrous smelter shall permit, cause, suffer, or allow particulate matter to the atmosphere from:
              (i) The stack or stacks serving the acid plant in excess of 0.05 grains per dry standard cubic foot of discharge gas.
              (ii) The stack or stacks serving the reverberatory feed dryer in excess of 0.05 grains per dry standard cubic foot of discharge gas.
              (c) Regulation for compliance testing (particulate matter from nonferrous smelter). The requirements of § 60.8(f) of 40 CFR part 60 shall apply to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and to each operation of Section B.4 of New Mexico Regulation 506.

Hovey, NYSDEC. Changes in definitions are acceptable to EPA unless a previously approved definition is necessary for implementation of an existing SIP regulation.
                    EPA is including the definition of “federally enforceable” with the understanding that (1) the definition applies to provisions of a Title V permit that are correctly identified as federally enforceable, and (2) a source accepts operating limits and conditions to lower its potential to emit to become a minor source, not to “avoid” applicable requirements.
                    • EPA is approving incorporation by reference of those documents that are not already federally enforceable.

              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this section, the Administrator approves the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone element of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of requirements for reasonable available control technology (RACT) by January 1985 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by Control Techniques Guidelines (CTGs) issued by the previous January.

Separate from and independent of this determination, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area, and data for 2011, EPA determined, as of June 18, 2012, that the NY-NJ-CT one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone NAAQS.
              (b) Determination of attainment. The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Jamestown, NY 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment area has attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Jamestown, NY nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

              (j)(1) The 1990 and 2007 conformity emission budgets for the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island nonattainment area contained in New York's January 29, 2003 SIP revision, amended by New York's June 29, 2003 submittal and January 18, 2005 comment letter.
              (2) The revised commitment to perform a mid-course review and submit the results by December 31, 2004 included in the January 29, 2003 SIP revision is approved.
              (k)(1) The September 1, 2006 New York reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis plan submittal, supplemented on February 8, 2008 and September 16, 2008, which applies to the entire State and to the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT and the Poughkeepsie 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment areas is conditionally approved.
              (2) The moderate area reasonably available control measure (RACM) analysis for the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area as presented in the February 8, 2008 “New York SIP for Ozone—Attainment Demonstration for New York Metro Area” submittal is conditionally approved.
              (l)(1) The following State Implementation Plan (SIP) elements are approved: The 2002 base year emissions inventory, the 2008 projection year emissions inventories, the 2008 motor vehicle emissions budgets used for planning purposes, the 2008 ozone reasonable further progress (RFP) plan, and the 2008 RFP Plan contingency measures as they apply to the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area. These elements are included in the package entitled “New York SIP for Ozone-Attainment Demonstration for New York Metro Area,” dated February 8, 2008 and supplemented on December 28, 2009 and January 26, 2011.
              (2) The following SIP elements are approved: The 2002 base year emissions inventory for the Poughkeepsie 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area and the state-wide 2002 base year emissions inventory. These elements are included in a package entitled, “New York SIP for Ozone-Attainment Demonstration for Poughkeepsie, NY Area,” dated February 8, 2008 and supplemented on December 28, 2009 and January 26, 2011.

              (2) The 1997 8-hour ozone attainment demonstration for the Poughkeepsie nonattainment area included in New York's February 8, 2008 State Implementation Plan revision is approved and satisfies the requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act.
              (n) Rescission of clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012 to 2014 show the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Therefore, the EPA is rescinding the clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard only. The prior determination (see paragraph (f)(2)(viii) of this section) is in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918. The prior determination suspended the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This rescission of the clean data determination will result in a SIP Call for a new ozone attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard, for this area only. If the revised plan is approved by the EPA as demonstrating reasonable further progress and attainment for the more stringent 2008 NAAQS by the Moderate area attainment date, and is approved by the EPA as containing adequate contingency measures for the 2008 NAAQS, then the plan would be deemed to have also satisfied requirements of the SIP Call associated with violations for the 1997 NAAQS.
              (o) The portion of the SIP submitted on April 4, 2013 addressing Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) for the 2008 ozone NAAQS is disapproved.
              (p)(1) The December 22, 2014 New York reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis plan, as supplemented on September 6, 2017, submitted pursuant to the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS), which applies to the entire State, including the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) and the Jamestown 8-hour ozone marginal nonattainment areas, is conditionally approved as it applies to the Clean Air Act control techniques guidelines (CTG) requirements for major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC).

              (2) The remainder of New York's December 22, 2014 RACT analysis plan, pursuant to the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS as applied to the entire State, including the New York portion of the NY-NJ-CT and the Jamestown 8-hour ozone marginal nonattainment areas, and as it applies to non-CTG major sources of VOCs and to major sources of oxides of nitrogen (NOX), is approved.
              (3) The December 22, 2014 New York plan submittal providing a nonattainment new source review (NNSR) certification as sufficient for purposes of the state-wide 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS, including the New York portion of the NY-NJ-CT and the Jamestown 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas, is approved.

              (q) EPA is determining that the Jamestown marginal nonattainment area (consisting of Chautauqua County) has attained the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). This determination (informally known as a Clean Data Determination) is based upon complete, quality assured, and certified ambient air monitoring data that show the Jamestown Area has monitored attainment of the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the 2012-2014 and 2015-2017 monitoring periods. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for this area as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in this area, this determination shall no longer apply.
              (r) New York's Section 185 Equivalency Demonstration State Implementation Plan revision submittal on January 31, 2014, and supplemented on April 7, 2014, October 13, 2016, and April 3, 2018, for the use of the State of New York's Low Emissions Vehicle (LEV II) program as an alternative program to fulfill the Clean Air Act section 185 requirement for the New York portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area for the revoked 1979 1-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard is approved.

              Control strategy: Ozone.
              (a) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined, as of November 15, 2011, the bi-state Charlotte-Gastonia-Rockhill, North Carolina-South Carolina nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standards for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
              (b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2008-2010, EPA determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2) to determine, based on the Area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the Area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 181(b)(2).
              (c) Determination of attainment. The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment area has attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

              § 52.1781
              Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

              (a) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as outlined in the three-year variance for the coal-fired units of Duke Power Company and Carolina Power & Light Company from the particulate emission limits of Regulation 15 N.C.A.C. 2D.0503, with submittals on June 18, September 7, October 31, and December 14, 1979, by the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, is disapproved only insofar that it provides an exemption for excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and verified malfunction. (See § 52.1770(c)(22).)
              (b) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as contained in regulation 15 NCAC 2D.0536, which was submitted on January 24 and February 21, 1983, and on December 17, 1985, and became effective on August 1, 1987, is disapproved insofar as it provides annual opacity limits for the seven plants of Duke Power Company and for Plants Roxboro and Cape Fear of Carolina Power and Light Company.
              (c) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as contained in revisions to 15 NCAC 2D.0536 submitted on January 24, 1983, February 21, 1983, and December 17, 1985, is disapproved as it applies to the Carolina Power and Light Asheville, Lee, Sutton and Weatherspoon Plants. These plants will continue to be subject to the particulate limits of 15 NCAC 2D.0503, contained in the original SIP, submitted to EPA on January 27, 1972, and approved on May 31, 1982 at 47 FR 10884.
              (d) In letters dated February 4, 1987, and June 15, 1987, the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules.
              (e) Determination of Attaining Data. EPA has determined, as of January 4, 2010, the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point, North Carolina, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (f) Determination of Attaining Data. EPA has determined, as of January 5, 2010, the Hickory-Morganton-Lenoir, North Carolina, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (g) Disapproval. EPA is disapproving portions of North Carolina's Infrastructure SIP for the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS addressing interstate transport, specifically with respect to section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).

              (h) North Carolina submitted a control strategy plan for particulate matter entitled, “An Act to Improve Air Quality in the State by Imposing Limits on the Emission of Certain Pollutants from Certain Facilities that Burn Coal to Generate Electricity and to Provide for Recovery by Electric Utilities of the Costs of Achieving Compliance with Those Limits.” The State expects the resulting emission reductions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from this control plan will serve as a significant step towards meeting the 1997 PM2.5 and 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), among other NAAQS, improving visibility in the mountains and other scenic vistas, and reducing acid rain. The specific approved provisions, submitted on August 21, 2009, are paragraphs (a) through (e) of Section 1 of Session Law 2002-4, Senate Bill 1078 enacted and state effective on June 20, 2002. This approval does not include paragraphs (f) through (j) of Section 1 of Senate Bill 1078 nor any of Section 2 of Senate Bill 1078.

              (a)-(b) [Reserved]

              (c) The State of North Dakota has clarified the language contained in the North Dakota Administrative Code on the use of the EPA “Guideline on Air Quality Models” as supplemented by the “North Dakota Guideline for Air Quality Modeling Analysis”.In a letter to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, dated February 14, 1992, Dana K. Mount, Director of the Division of Environmental Engineering, stated:
              
              
                To clarify this issue, the State of North Dakota will commit to meeting all requirements of the EPA Guideline for air quality modeling demonstrations associated with the permitting of new PSD sources, PSD major modifications, and sources which will be located in nonattainment areas. If any conflict exists, the EPA Guideline will take precedence for these source categories.

              § 52.1825
              Federal implementation plan for regional haze.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies to each owner and operator of the following coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) in the State of North Dakota: Coal Creek Station, Units 1 and 2; Antelope Valley Station, Units 1 and 2.
              (b) Definitions. Terms not defined below shall have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act or EPA's regulations implementing the Clean Air Act. For purposes of this section:
              (1) Boiler operating day means a 24-hour period between 12 midnight and the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time in the EGU. It is not necessary for fuel to be combusted for the entire 24-hour period.
              (2) Continuous emission monitoring system or CEMS means the equipment required by this section to sample, analyze, measure, and provide, by means of readings recorded at least once every 15 minutes (using an automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS)), a permanent record of NOX emissions, other pollutant emissions, diluent, or stack gas volumetric flow rate.
              (3) NO
                X means nitrogen oxides.
              (4) Owner/operator means any person who owns or who operates, controls, or supervises an EGU identified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (5) Unit means any of the EGUs identified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Emissions limitations. (1) The owners/operators subject to this section shall not emit or cause to be emitted NOX in excess of the following limitations, in pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu), averaged over a rolling 30-day period:
              
              
                
                  Source name
                  NOX Emission limit (lb/MMBtu)
                
                
                  Coal Creek Station, Units 1 and 2
                  0.13, averaged across both units.
                
                
                  Antelope Valley Station, Unit 1
                  0.17.
                
                
                  Antelope Valley Station, Unit 2
                  0.17.
                
              
              (2) These emission limitations shall apply at all times, including startups, shutdowns, emergencies, and malfunctions.
              (d) Compliance date. The owners and operators of Coal Creek Station shall comply with the emissions limitation and other requirements of this section within five (5) years of the effective date of this rule, unless otherwise indicated in specific paragraphs. The owners and operators of Antelope Valley Station shall comply with the emissions limitations and other requirements of this section as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than July 31, 2018, unless otherwise indicated in specific paragraphs.
              (e) Compliance determination—(1) CEMS. At all times after the compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate, and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR part 75, to accurately measure NOX, diluent, and stack gas volumetric flow rate from each unit. The CEMS shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit.
              (2) Method. (i) For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average NOX concentration in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 75. At the end of each boiler operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current boiler operating day and the previous 29 successive boiler operating days.
              (ii) An hourly average NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 75, is acquired by both the NOX pollutant concentration monitor and the diluent monitor (O2 or CO2).
              (iii) Data reported to meet the requirements of this section shall not include data substituted using the missing data substitution procedures of subpart D of 40 CFR part 75, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of 40 CFR part 75.
              (f) Recordkeeping. Owner/operator shall maintain the following records for at least five years:
              (1) All CEMS data, including the date, place, and time of sampling or measurement; parameters sampled or measured; and results.
              (2) Records of quality assurance and quality control activities for emissions measuring systems including, but not limited to, any records required by 40 CFR part 75.
              (3) Records of all major maintenance activities conducted on emission units, air pollution control equipment, and CEMS.
              (4) Any other records required by 40 CFR part 75.
              (g) Reporting. All reports under this section shall be submitted to the Director, Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Environmental Justice, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 8, Mail Code 8ENF-AT, 1595 Wynkoop Street, Denver, Colorado 80202-1129.
              (1) Owner/operator shall submit quarterly excess emissions reports no later than the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter. Excess emissions means emissions that exceed the emissions limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The reports shall include the magnitude, date(s), and duration of each period of excess emissions, specific identification of each period of excess emissions that occurs during startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the unit, the nature and cause of any malfunction (if known), and the corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted.

              (2) Owner/operator shall submit quarterly CEMS performance reports, to include dates and duration of each period during which the CEMS was inoperative (except for zero and span adjustments and calibration checks), reason(s) why the CEMS was inoperative and steps taken to prevent recurrence, any CEMS repairs or adjustments, and results of any CEMS performance tests required by 40 CFR part 75 (Relative Accuracy Test Audits, Relative Accuracy Audits, and Cylinder Gas Audits).
              (3) When no excess emissions have occurred or the CEMS has not been inoperative, repaired, or adjusted during the reporting period, such information shall be stated in the report.
              (h) Notifications. (1) Owner/operator shall submit notification of commencement of construction of any equipment which is being constructed to comply with the NOX emission limits in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (2) Owner/operator shall submit semi-annual progress reports on construction of any such equipment.
              (3) Owner/operator shall submit notification of initial startup of any such equipment.
              (i) Equipment operation. At all times, owner/operator shall maintain each unit, including associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.
              (j) Credible Evidence. Nothing in this section shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with requirements of this section if the appropriate performance or compliance test procedures or method had been performed.

              Minor source permit to operate program.
              Emission limitations and related provisions, which, in accordance with Rule 33-15-14-03, are established as federally enforceable conditions in North Dakota minor source operating permits, shall be enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures and will be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements of EPA's underlying regulations.

              § 52.1835
              Change to approved plan.
              North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 33-15-12, Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources, is removed from the approved plan. This change is a result of the State's September 10, 1997 request for delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Clean Air Act New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) promulgated in 40 CFR Part 60, as in effect on October 1, 1996 (except subpart Eb, which the State has not adopted). EPA granted that delegation of authority on May 28, 1998.

              § 52.1836
              Change to approved plan.

              North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 33-15-13, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, is removed from the approved plan. This change is a result of EPA's July 7, 1995 interim approval of North Dakota's Title V Operating Permit program, in which it granted delegation of authority to North Dakota to implement and enforce Clean Air Act section 112 requirements. That delegation of authority includes, among other things, the NESHAPs promulgated in 40 CFR part 61 (“part 61 NESHAPs”). With a September 10, 1997 submittal, the State requested delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Clean Air Act part 61 NESHAPSs (except subparts B, H, K, Q, R, T, and W, pertaining to radionuclides), as in effect on October 1, 1996. EPA did not act on the State's request for delegation of authority for 40 CFR part 61, subpart I (regarding radionuclide emissions from facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other Federal facilities not covered by subpart H) because EPA rescinded subpart I subsequent to the State's adoption of these revisions.

              § 52.1873
              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart the Administrator approves Ohio's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all the requirements of Part D, Title 1 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by January 1, 1981 for the sources covered by CTGs between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
              (b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
              (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:

              (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; or

              (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; and,
              (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:

              (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e; or

              (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more.
              (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
              (i) the term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
              (ii) The term tpy CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
              (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.

              (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO2e.

              (iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in 3745-31-01(III)(4) of Ohio's Administrative Code) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs 3745-31-01, paragraphs (SSS) and (LLLLL)(1) of Ohio's Administrative Code) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO2e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO2e instead of applying the value in paragraph 3745-31-01(LLLLL)(2) of Ohio's Administrative Code.

              Control strategy: Nitrogen dioxide.
              (a) The condition to EPA's approval of the oxides of nitrogen State Implementation Plan (SIP) codified at 40 CFR 52.1870(c)(128) is satisfied by Ohio's November 26, 2003, submittal of the change to the flow control date in the oxides of nitrogen budget trading SIP.

              § 52.1877
              Control strategy: Photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons).
              (a) The requirements of Subpart G of this chapter are not met because the Ohio plan does not provide for the attainment and maintenance of the national standard for photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons) in the Metropolitan Cincinnati interstate region by May 31, 1975.
              (b) The requirements of § 52.14 are not met by Rule 3745-21-09(N)(3) (a) and (e); Rule 3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a); Rule 3745-21-10, Section G; and Rule 3745-21-10, Section H, because these Ohio Rules do not provide for attainment and maintenance of the photochemical oxidant (hydrocarbon) standards throughout Ohio.

              (1) USEPA is disapproving new exemptions for the use of cutback asphalt [(Rule 3745-21-09(N)(3) (a) and (e)], because Ohio did not provide documentation regarding the temperature ranges in the additional two months that the State permits the use of cutback asphalts, and a lack of training is not sufficient reason for the 1000 gallons exemptions.
              (2) USEPA is disapproving Section V [Rule 3745-21-09(V)], because it contains an alternative leak testing procedure for gasoline tank trucks which USEPA finds to be unapprovable.
              (3) USEPA is disapproving exclusion of the external floating roof (crude oil) storage tanks from the secondary seal requirement [Rule 3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a)], because Ohio has not demonstrated that the relaxation would not interfere with the timely attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone.
              (4) USEPA is disapproving compliance test method Section G, [Rule 3745-21-10] as an alternative leak testing procedure for gasoline tank trucks, because such action on Section G, is consistent with USEPA's action on Rule 3745-21-09(V), which USEPA finds to be unapprovable.
              (5) USEPA is disapproving compliance test method Section H, [Rule 3745-21-10], which involves a pressure test of only the vapor recovery lines and associated equipment. Compliance test method Section H is inconsistent with USEPA's control technique guidances and with tank truck certification regulations that are in effect in 19 other States. In addition, OEPA has presented no acceptable evidence demonstrating why this rule constitutes RACT.

              Review of new sources and modifications.
              (a) The requirements of sections 172, 173, 182, and 189 for permitting of major new sources and major modifications in nonattainment areas for ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide are not met, because Ohio's regulations exempt source categories which may not be exempted and because the State has not adopted the new permitting requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in a clear or enforceable manner.
              (b) [Reserved]
              (c) The requirements of § 51.161 of this chapter are not met because the State failed to submit procedures providing for public comment on review of new or modified stationary sources.

              (d) Regulation providing for public comment. (1) For purposes of this paragraph, Director shall mean the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
              
              (2) Prior to approval or disapproval of the construction or modification of a stationary source, the Director shall:
              (i) Make a preliminary determination whether construction or modification of the stationary source should be approved, approved with conditions or disapproved;
              (ii) Make available in at least one location in the region in which the proposed stationary source would be constructed or modified, a copy of all materials submitted by the owner or operator, a copy of the Director's preliminary determination, and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered by the Director in making his preliminary determination; and
              (iii) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the region in which the proposed stationary source would be constructed or modified, of the opportunity for public comment on the information submitted by the owner or operator and the Director's preliminary determination on the approvability of the new or modified stationary source.
              (3) A copy of the notice required pursuant to this paragraph shall be sent to the Administrator through the appropriate regional office and to all other State and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction within the region where the stationary source will be constructed or modified.
              (4) Public comments submitted in writing within 30 days of the date such information is made available shall be considered by the Director in making his final decision on the application.

              (e) Approval—EPA is approving requests submitted by the State of Ohio on March 18, November 1, and November 15, 1994, for exemption from the requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the following counties in Ohio from the NOX related general and transportation conformity provisions and nonattainment area NSR for new sources and modifications that are major for NOX: Clinton, Columbiana, Delaware, Franklin, Jefferson, Licking, Mahoning, Preble, Stark, and Trumbull. This approval also exempts the following counties in Ohio from the NOX related general conformity provisions; nonattainment area NSR for new sources and modifications that are major for NOX; NOX RACT; and a demonstration of compliance with the enhanced I/M performance standard for NOX: Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit.

              (f) Approval—USEPA is approving two exemption requests submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency on September 20, 1993, and November 8, 1993, for the Toledo and Dayton ozone nonattainment areas, respectively, from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the Lucas, Wood, Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties from the requirements to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOX), nonattainment area new source review (NSR) for new sources and modifications that are major for NOX, and the NOX-related requirements of the general and transportation conformity provisions. For the Dayton ozone nonattainment area, the Dayton local area has opted for an enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. Upon final approval of this exemption, the Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties shall not be required to demonstrate compliance with the enhanced I/M performance standard for NOX. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Toledo or Dayton area(s), the exemptions from the requirements of Section 182(f) of the Act in the applicable area(s) shall no longer apply.

              (g) Approval—EPA is approving an exemption from the requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts Butler, Clermont, Hamilton, and Warren counties in Ohio from nonattainment NSR for new sources and modifications that are major for NOX.

              Control strategy: Particulate matter.
              (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met because the Ohio plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the secondary standards for particulate matter in the Greater Metropolitan Cleveland Intrastate Region and the Ohio portions of the Northwest Pennsylvania-Youngstown and the Steubenville-Weirton-Wheeling Interstate Regions.
              (b) In Pickaway County, Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company, or any subsequent owner or operator of the Picway Generating Station, shall not operate simultaneously Units 3 and 4 (boilers 7 and 8) at any time. These units will terminate operation no later than October 1, 1980.
              (c) Ohio Regulation EP-12 (open burning) is disapproved insofar as EP-12-03(D)(1) and EP-12-04(D)(1) allow open burning of hazardous or toxic materials.
              (d)-(f) [Reserved]
              (g) The B.F. Goodrich Chemical Plant State Implementation Plan revision is being disapproved because it is not supported by an adequate attainment demonstration and therefore does not meet the requirements of § 51.13(e).

USEPA is identifying deficiencies in the existing Rule 3745-21-09(D)(3) which contains an alternative daily emission limitation for can coating facilities. USEPA identified the following deficiencies within this rule: This rule presents equations for determining an alternative daily emission limitation. USEPA finds that the equations are incorrect in that they are based on volume of coating used (in gallons, excluding water), which in many cases can lead to erroneous results. Equivalency calculations for coatings should be performed on a basis of volume of coating solids used rather than volume of coating used. (45 FR 80824 gives an example calculation for can coating done on a volume solids basis.)

              (155) On March 11, 2011, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency submitted Ohio's regional haze plan addressing the first implementation period of the regional haze rule requirements. This plan includes a long-term strategy with emission limits for mandating emission reductions equivalent to the reductions from implement best available retrofit technology and with emission reductions to provide Ohio's contribution toward achievement of reasonable progress goals at Class I areas affected by Ohio. The plan specifically satisfies BART requirements for non-EGUs, most notably by providing new, tighter emission limits for the P.H. Glatfelter facility in Ross County, Ohio. The plan establishes a combined daily sulfur dioxide emission limit of 24,930 pounds per day for boiler #7 and #8. The plan also includes permit number P0103673 that will impose these emission limitations on P.H. Glatfelter Company.
              (i) Incorporation by reference.

                Regional Administrator means the Regional Administrator of EPA Region 6 or his/her authorized representative.
              
                Unit means one of the coal fired boilers covered under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (d) Emissions Limitations.
              
              SO2
                emission limit. The individual sulfur dioxide emission limit for a unit shall be 0.06 pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu) as averaged over a rolling 30 boiler-operating-day period. For each unit, SO2 emissions for each calendar day shall be determined by summing the hourly emissions measured in pounds of SO2. For each unit, heat input for each boiler-operating-day shall be determined by adding together all hourly heat inputs, in millions of BTU. Each boiler-operating-day the thirty-day rolling average for a unit shall be determined by adding together the pounds of SO2 from that day and the preceding 29 boiler-operating-days and dividing the total pounds of SO2 by the sum of the heat input during the same 30 boiler-operating-day period. The result shall be the 30 boiler-operating-day rolling average in terms of lb/MMBtu emissions of SO2. If a valid SO2 pounds per hour or heat input is not available for any hour for a unit, that heat input and SO2 pounds per hour shall not be used in the calculation of the 30 boiler-operating-day rolling average for SO2.
              (e) Testing and monitoring. (1) No later than the compliance date in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) for SO2 on Units 4 and 5 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Muskogee plant; and Units 1 and 2 of the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Sooner plant in accordance with 40 CFR 60.8 and 60.13(e), (f), and (h), and Appendix B of Part 60. The owner or operator shall comply with the quality assurance procedures for CEMS found in 40 CFR part 75. Compliance with the emission limits for SO2 shall be determined by using data from a CEMS.

              (2) Continuous emissions monitoring shall apply during all periods of operation of the coal burning equipment, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments. Continuous monitoring systems for measuring SO2 and diluent gas shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Hourly averages shall be computed using at least one data point in each fifteen minute quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant in an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of performance of calibration, quality assurance, preventive maintenance activities, or backups of data from data acquisition and handling system, and recertification events. When valid SO2 pounds per hour, or SO2 pounds per million Btu emission data are not obtained because of continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span adjustments, emission data must be obtained by using other monitoring systems approved by the EPA to provide emission data for a minimum of 18 hours in each 24 hour period and at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days.
              (f) Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements. Unless otherwise stated all requests, reports, submittals, notifications, and other communications to the Regional Administrator required by this section shall be submitted, unless instructed otherwise, to the Director, Multimedia Planning and Permitting Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, to the attention of Mail Code: 6PD, at 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 1200, Dallas, Texas 75202-2733. For each unit subject to the emissions limitation in this section and upon completion of the installation of CEMS as required in this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements:
              (1) For each emissions limit in this section, comply with the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for CEMS compliance monitoring in 40 CFR 60.7(c) and (d).
              (2) For each day, provide the total SO2 emitted that day by each emission unit. For any hours on any unit where data for hourly pounds or heat input is missing, identify the unit number and monitoring device that did not produce valid data that caused the missing hour.
              (g) Equipment Operations. At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate the unit including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Regional Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the unit.
              (h) Enforcement.
              
              (1) Notwithstanding any other provision in this implementation plan, any credible evidence or information relevant as to whether the unit would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not the owner or operator has violated or is in violation of any standard or applicable emission limit in the plan.
              (2) Emissions in excess of the level of the applicable emission limit or requirement that occur due to a malfunction shall constitute a violation of the applicable emission limit.
