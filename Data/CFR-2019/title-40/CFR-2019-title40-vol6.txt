      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

These performance requirements and the specific test(s) for them will be determined by Administrator for each specific candidate method or type of candidate method and may be similar to or based on corresponding tests and requirements set forth in subpart F of this part or may be special requirements and tests tailored by the Administrator to the specific nature, design, and operational characteristics of the candidate method. For example, a candidate method with an inlet design deviating substantially from the design of the reference method inlet would likely be subject to an inlet aspiration test similar to that set forth in § 53.63. Similarly, a candidate method having an inertial fractionation system substantially different from that of the reference method would likely be subject to a static fractionation test and a loading test similar to those set forth in §§ 53.64 and 53.65, respectively. A candidate method with more extensive or profound deviations from the design and function of the reference method may be subject to other tests, full wind-tunnel tests similar to those described in § 53.62, or to special tests adapted or developed individually to accommodate the specific type of measurement or operation of the candidate method.
              (4) All designated FEM for PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 must be manufactured in an ISO 9001-registered facility, as defined in § 53.1 and as set forth in § 53.51.

              (3) A brief statement of the probable effect if the applicant believes the modification will or may affect the performance characteristics of the method.
              (4) Such further information, including test data, as may be necessary to explain and support any statement required by paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
              (c) Within 90 calendar days after receiving a report under paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator will take one or more of the following actions:
              (1) Notify the applicant that the designation will continue to apply to the method if the modification is implemented.

              (2) Send notice to the applicant that a new designation will apply to the method (as modified) if the modification is implemented, submit notice of the determination for publication in the Federal Register, and revise or supplement the list referred to in § 53.8(c) to reflect the determination.

              (3) Send notice to the applicant that the designation will not apply to the method (as modified) if the modification is implemented and submit notice of the determination for publication in the Federal Register.
              
              (4) Send notice to the applicant that additional information must be submitted before a determination can be made and specify the additional information that is needed (in such cases, the 30-day period shall commence upon receipt of the additional information).
              (5) Send notice to the applicant that additional tests are necessary and specify what tests are necessary and how they shall be interpreted (in such cases, the 30-day period shall commence upon receipt of the additional test data).
              (6) Send notice to the applicant that additional tests will be conducted by the Administrator and specify the reasons for and the nature of the additional tests (in such cases, the 30-day period shall commence 1 calendar day after the additional tests are completed).
              (d) An applicant who has received a notice under paragraph (c)(3) of this section may appeal the Administrator's action as follows:
              (1) The applicant may submit new or additional information pertinent to the intended modification.
              (2) The applicant may request the Administrator to reconsider data and information already submitted.
              (3) The applicant may request that the Administrator repeat any test conducted that was a material factor in the Administrator's determination. A representative of the applicant may be present during the performance of any such retest.

              § 53.15
              Trade secrets and confidential or privileged information.

              Any information submitted under this part that is claimed to be a trade secret or confidential or privileged information shall be marked or otherwise clearly identified as such in the submittal. Information so identified will be treated in accordance with part 2 of this chapter (concerning public information).
            
            
              § 53.16
              Supersession of reference methods.
              (a) This section prescribes procedures and criteria applicable to requests that the Administrator specify a new reference method, or a new measurement principle and calibration procedure on which reference methods shall be based, by revision of the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter. Such action will ordinarily be taken only if the Administrator determines that a candidate method or a variation thereof is substantially superior to the existing reference method(s).
              (b) In exercising discretion under this section, the Administrator will consider:
              (1) The benefits, in terms of the requirements and purposes of the Act, that would result from specifying a new reference method or a new measurement principle and calibration procedure.
              (2) The potential economic consequences of such action for State and local control agencies.
              (3) Any disruption of State and local air quality monitoring programs that might result from such action.
              (c) An applicant who wishes the Administrator to consider revising an appendix to part 50 of this chapter on the ground that the applicant's candidate method is substantially superior to the existing reference method(s) shall submit an application for a reference or equivalent method determination in accordance with § 53.4 and shall indicate therein that such consideration is desired. The application shall include, in addition to the information required by § 53.4, data and any other information supporting the applicant's claim that the candidate method is substantially superior to the existing reference method(s).

              (d) After receiving an application under paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will publish notice of its receipt in the Federal Register and, within 120 calendar days after receipt of the application, take one of the following actions:
              (1) Determine that it is appropriate to propose a revision of the appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question and send notice of the determination to the applicant.
              (2) Determine that it is inappropriate to propose a revision of the appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question, determine whether the candidate method is a reference or equivalent method, and send notice of the determinations, including a statement of reasons for the determination not to propose a revision, to the applicant.
              (3) Send notice to the applicant that additional information must be submitted before a determination can be made and specify the additional information that is needed (in such cases, the 120-day period shall commence upon receipt of the additional information).
              (4) Send notice to the applicant that additional tests are necessary, specifying what tests are necessary and how the test shall be interpreted (in such cases, the 120-day period shall commence upon receipt of the additional test data).
              (5) Send notice to the applicant that additional tests will be conducted by the Administrator, specifying the nature of and reasons for the additional tests and the estimated time required (in such cases, the 120-day period shall commence 1 calendar day after the additional tests have been completed).

              (e)(1)(i) After making a determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. The notice of proposed rulemaking will indicate that the Administrator proposes:
              (A) To revise the appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question.
              (B) Where the appendix specifies a measurement principle and calibration procedure, to cancel reference method designations based on the appendix.
              (C) To cancel equivalent method designations based on the existing reference method(s).

              (ii) The notice of proposed rulemaking will include the terms or substance of the proposed revision, will indicate what period(s) of time the Administrator proposes to allow for replacement of existing methods under section 2.3 of appendix C to part 58 of this chapter, and will solicit public comments on the proposal with particular reference to the considerations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

              (2)(i) If, after consideration of comments received, the Administrator determines that the appendix to part 50 in question should be revised, the Administrator will, by publication in the Federal Register:
              (A) Promulgate the proposed revision, with such modifications as may be appropriate in view of comments received.
              (B) Where the appendix to part 50 (prior to revision) specifies a measurement principle and calibration procedure, cancel reference method designations based on the appendix.
              (C) Cancel equivalent method designations based on the existing reference method(s).
              (D) Specify the period(s) that will be allowed for replacement of existing methods under section 2.3 of appendix C to part 58 of this chapter, with such modifications from the proposed period(s) as may be appropriate in view of comments received.
              (3) Canceled designations will be deleted from the list maintained under § 53.8(c). The requirements and procedures for cancellation set forth in § 53.11 shall be inapplicable to cancellation of reference or equivalent method designations under this section.
              (4) If the appendix to part 50 of this chapter in question is revised to specify a new measurement principle and calibration procedure on which the applicant's candidate method is based, the Administrator will take appropriate action under § 53.5 to determine whether the candidate method is a reference method.
              (5) Upon taking action under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the Administrator will send notice of the action to all applicants for whose methods reference and equivalent method designations are canceled by such action.
              (f) An applicant who has received notice of a determination under paragraph (d)(2) of this section may appeal the determination by taking one or more of the following actions:
              (1) The applicant may submit new or additional information in support of the application.
              (2) The applicant may request that the Administrator reconsider the data and information already submitted.
              (3) The applicant may request that any test conducted by the Administrator that was a material factor in making the determination be repeated.

              § 53.20
              General provisions.
              (a) The test procedures given in this subpart shall be used to test the performance of candidate automated methods against the performance requirement specifications given in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53. A test analyzer representative of the candidate automated method must exhibit performance better than, or not outside, the specified limit or limits for each such performance parameter specified (except range) to satisfy the requirements of this subpart. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the measurement range of the candidate method must be the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 to satisfy the requirements of this subpart.
              (b) Measurement ranges. For a candidate method having more than one selectable measurement range, one range must be the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53, and a test analyzer representative of the method must pass the tests required by this subpart while operated in that range.
              (i) Higher ranges. The tests may be repeated for one or more higher (broader) ranges (i.e., ranges extending to higher concentrations) than the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53, provided that the range does not extend to concentrations more than four times the upper range limit of the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53. For such higher ranges, only the tests for range (calibration), noise at 80% of the upper range limit, and lag, rise and fall time are required to be repeated. For the purpose of testing a higher range, the test procedure of § 53.23(e) may be abridged to include only those components needed to test lag, rise and fall time.
              (ii) Lower ranges. The tests may be repeated for one or more lower (narrower) ranges (i.e., ones extending to lower concentrations) than the standard range specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53. For methods for some pollutants, table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 specifies special performance limit requirements for lower ranges. If special low-range performance limit requirements are not specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53, then the performance limit requirements for the standard range apply. For lower ranges for any method, only the tests for range (calibration), noise at 0% of the measurement range, lower detectable limit, (and nitric oxide interference for SO2 UVF methods) are required to be repeated, provided the tests for the standard range shows the applicable limit specifications are met for the other test parameters.
              (iii) If the tests are conducted and passed only for the specified standard range, any FRM or FEM determination with respect to the method will be limited to that range. If the tests are passed for both the specified range and one or more higher or lower ranges, any such determination will include the additional higher or lower range(s) as well as the specified standard range. Appropriate test data shall be submitted for each range sought to be included in a FRM or FEM method determination under this paragraph (b).
              (c) For each performance parameter (except range), the test procedure shall be initially repeated seven (7) times to yield 7 test results. Each result shall be compared with the corresponding performance limit specification in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53; a value higher than or outside the specified limit or limits constitutes a failure. These 7 results for each parameter shall be interpreted as follows:
              (1) Zero (0) failures: The candidate method passes the test for the performance parameter.
              (2) Three (3) or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for the performance parameter.
              (3) One (1) or two (2) failures: Repeat the test procedures for the performance parameter eight (8) additional times yielding a total of fifteen (15) test results. The combined total of 15 test results shall then be interpreted as follows:
              (i) One (1) or two (2) failures: The candidate method passes the test for the performance parameter.
              (ii) Three (3) or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for the performance parameter.
              (d) The tests for zero drift, span drift, lag time, rise time, fall time, and precision shall be carried out in a single integrated procedure conducted at various line voltages and ambient temperatures specified in § 53.23(e). A temperature-controlled environmental test chamber large enough to contain the test analyzer is recommended for this test. The tests for noise, lower detectable limit, and interference equivalent shall be conducted at any ambient temperature between 20 °C and 30 °C, at any normal line voltage between 105 and 125 volts, and shall be conducted such that not more than three (3) test results for each parameter are obtained in any 24-hour period.
              (e) If necessary, all measurement response readings to be recorded shall be converted to concentration units or adjusted according to the calibration curve constructed in accordance with § 53.21(b).
              (f) All recorder chart tracings (or equivalent data plots), records, test data and other documentation obtained from or pertinent to these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and submitted.
              
                Note to § 53.20:

                Suggested formats for reporting the test results and calculations are provided in Figures B-2, B-3, B-4, B-5, and B-6 in appendix A to this subpart. Symbols and abbreviations used in this subpart are listed in table B-5 of appendix A to this subpart.
              
            
            
              § 53.21
              Test conditions.
              (a) Set-up and start-up of the test analyzer shall be in strict accordance with the operating instructions specified in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). Allow adequate warm-up or stabilization time as indicated in the operating instructions before beginning the tests. The test procedures assume that the test analyzer has a conventional analog measurement signal output that is connected to a suitable strip chart recorder of the servo, null-balance type. This recorder shall have a chart width of at least 25 centimeters, chart speeds up to 10 cm per hour, a response time of 1 second or less, a deadband of not more than 0.25 percent of full scale, and capability either of reading measurements at least 5 percent below zero or of offsetting the zero by at least 5 percent. If the test analyzer does not have an analog signal output, or if a digital or other type of measurement data output is used for the tests, an alternative measurement data recording device (or devices) may be used for recording the test data, provided that the device is reasonably suited to the nature and purposes of the tests, and an analog representation of the analyzer measurements for each test can be plotted or otherwise generated that is reasonably similar to the analog measurement recordings that would be produced by a conventional chart recorder connected to a conventional analog signal output.
              (b) Calibration of the test analyzer shall be carried out prior to conducting the tests described in this subpart. The calibration shall be as indicated in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3) and as follows: If the chart recorder or alternative data recorder does not have below zero capability, adjust either the controls of the test analyzer or the chart or data recorder to obtain a + 5% offset zero reading on the recorder chart to facilitate observing negative response or drift. If the candidate method is not capable of negative response, the test analyzer (not the data recorder) shall be operated with a similar offset zero. Construct and submit a calibration curve showing a plot of recorder scale readings or other measurement output readings (vertical or y-axis) against pollutant concentrations presented to the analyzer for measurement (horizontal or x-axis). If applicable, a plot of base analog output units (volts, millivolts, milliamps, etc.) against pollutant concentrations shall also be obtained and submitted. All such calibration plots shall consist of at least seven (7) approximately equally spaced, identifiable points, including 0 and 90 ±5 percent of the upper range limit (URL).
              (c) Once the test analyzer has been set up and calibrated and the tests started, manual adjustment or normal periodic maintenance is permitted only every 3 days. Automatic adjustments which the test analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time. The submitted records shall show clearly when any manual adjustment or periodic maintenance was made during the tests and describe the specific operations performed.
              (d) If the test analyzer should malfunction during any of the performance tests, the tests for that parameter shall be repeated. A detailed explanation of the malfunction, remedial action taken, and whether recalibration was necessary (along with all pertinent records and charts) shall be submitted. If more than one malfunction occurs, all performance test procedures for all parameters shall be repeated.
              (e) Tests for all performance parameters shall be completed on the same test analyzer; however, use of multiple test analyzers to accelerate testing is permissible for testing additional ranges of a multi-range candidate method.
            
            
              § 53.22
              Generation of test atmospheres.

              (a) Table B-2 to subpart B of part 53 specifies preferred methods for generating test atmospheres and suggested methods of verifying their concentrations. Only one means of establishing the concentration of a test atmosphere is normally required, provided that that means is adequately accurate and credible. If the method of generation can produce accurate, reproducible concentrations, verification is optional. If the method of generation is not reproducible or reasonably quantifiable, then establishment of the concentration by some credible verification method is required.
              (b) The test atmosphere delivery system shall be designed and constructed so as not to significantly alter the test atmosphere composition or concentration during the period of the test. The system shall be vented to insure that test atmospheres are presented to the test analyzer at very nearly atmospheric pressure. The delivery system shall be fabricated from borosilicate glass, FEP Teflon, or other material that is inert with regard to the gas or gases to be used.
              (c) The output of the test atmosphere generation system shall be sufficiently stable to obtain stable response readings from the test analyzer during the required tests. If a permeation device is used for generation of a test atmosphere, the device, as well as the air passing over it, shall be controlled to 0.1 °C.
              (d) All diluent air shall be zero air free of contaminants likely to react with the test atmospheres or cause a detectable response on the test analyzer.
              (e) The concentration of each test atmosphere used shall be quantitatively established and/or verified before or during each series of tests. Samples for verifying test concentrations shall be collected from the test atmosphere delivery system as close as feasible to the sample intake port of the test analyzer.

              (f) The accuracy of all flow measurements used to calculate test atmosphere concentrations shall be documented and referenced to a primary flow rate or volume standard (such as a spirometer, bubble meter, etc.). Any corrections shall be clearly shown. All flow measurements given in volume units shall be standardized to 25 °C and 760 mm Hg.
              (g) Schematic drawings, photos, descriptions, and other information showing complete procedural details of the test atmosphere generation, verification, and delivery system shall be provided. All pertinent calculations shall be clearly indicated.
            
            
              § 53.23
              Test procedures.
              (a) Range—(1) Technical definition. The nominal minimum and maximum concentrations that a method is capable of measuring.
              
                Note to § 53.23(a)(1):
                The nominal range is given as the lower and upper range limits in concentration units, for example, 0-0.5 parts per million (ppm).
              
              (2) Test procedure. Determine and submit a suitable calibration curve, as specified in § 53.21(b), showing the test analyzer's measurement response over at least 95 percent of the required or indicated measurement range.
              
                Note to § 53.23(a)(2):
                A single calibration curve for each measurement range for which an FRM or FEM designation is sought will normally suffice.
              
              (b) Noise—(1) Technical definition. Spontaneous, short duration deviations in measurements or measurement signal output, about the mean output, that are not caused by input concentration changes. Measurement noise is determined as the standard deviation of a series of measurements of a constant concentration about the mean and is expressed in concentration units.
              (2) Test procedure. (i) Allow sufficient time for the test analyzer to warm up and stabilize. Determine measurement noise at each of two fixed concentrations, first using zero air and then a pollutant test gas concentration as indicated below. The noise limit specification in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 shall apply to both of these tests.
              (ii) For an analyzer with an analog signal output, connect an integrating-type digital meter (DM) suitable for the test analyzer's output and accurate to three significant digits, to determine the analyzer's measurement output signal.
              
                Note to § 53.23(b)(2):
                Use of a chart recorder in addition to the DM is optional.
              
              (iii) Measure zero air with the test analyzer for 60 minutes. During this 60-minute interval, record twenty-five (25) test analyzer concentration measurements or DM readings at 2-minute intervals. (See Figure B-2 in appendix A of this subpart.)

              (iv) If applicable, convert each DM test reading to concentration units (ppm) or adjust the test readings (if necessary) by reference to the test analyzer's calibration curve as determined in § 53.21(b). Label and record the test measurements or converted DM readings as r
                1, r
                2, r
                3 . . . r
                i . . . r
                25.

              (v) Calculate measurement noise as the standard deviation, S, as follows:
              
                ER31AU11.005
              
              
                Where i indicates the i-th test measurement or DM reading in ppm.
              
              
              (vi) Let S at 0 ppm be identified as S
                0; compare S
                0 to the noise limit specification given in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53.

              (vii) Repeat steps in Paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) through (v) of this section using a pollutant test atmosphere concentration of 80 ±5 percent of the URL instead of zero air, and let S at 80 percent of the URL be identified as S
                80. Compare S
                80 to the noise limit specification given in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53.
              (viii) Both S
                0 and S
                80 must be less than or equal to the table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 noise limit specification to pass the test for the noise parameter.
              (c) Lower detectable limit—(1) Technical definition. The minimum pollutant concentration that produces a measurement or measurement output signal of at least twice the noise level.
              (2) Test procedure. (i) Allow sufficient time for the test analyzer to warm up and stabilize. Measure zero air and record the stable measurement reading in ppm as B
                Z. (See Figure B-3 in appendix A of this subpart.)
              (ii) Generate and measure a pollutant test concentration equal to the value for the lower detectable limit specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53.
              
                Note to § 53.23(c)(2):
                If necessary, the test concentration may be generated or verified at a higher concentration, then quantitatively and accurately diluted with zero air to the final required test concentration.
              

              (iii) Record the test analyzer's stable measurement reading, in ppm, as B
                L.
              (iv) Determine the lower detectable limit (LDL) test result as LDL = B
                L
                − B
                Z. Compare this LDL value with the noise level, S
                0, determined in § 53.23(b), for the 0 concentration test atmosphere. LDL must be equal to or higher than 2 × S
                0 to pass this test.
              (d) Interference equivalent—(1) Technical definition. Positive or negative measurement response caused by a substance other than the one being measured.
              (2) Test procedure. The test analyzer shall be tested for all substances likely to cause a detectable response. The test analyzer shall be challenged, in turn, with each potential interfering agent (interferent) specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53. In the event that there are substances likely to cause a significant interference which have not been specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53, these substances shall also be tested, in a manner similar to that for the specified interferents, at a concentration substantially higher than that likely to be found in the ambient air. The interference may be either positive or negative, depending on whether the test analyzer's measurement response is increased or decreased by the presence of the interferent. Interference equivalents shall be determined by mixing each interferent, one at a time, with the pollutant at an interferent test concentration not lower than the test concentration specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53 (or as otherwise required for unlisted interferents), and comparing the test analyzer's measurement response to the response caused by the pollutant alone. Known gas-phase reactions that might occur between a listed interferent and the pollutant are designated by footnote 3 in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53. In these cases, the interference equivalent shall be determined without mixing with the pollutant.
              
              (i) Allow sufficient time for warm-up and stabilization of the test analyzer.

              (ii) For a candidate method using a prefilter or scrubber device based upon a chemical reaction to derive part of its specificity and which device requires periodic service or maintenance, the test analyzer shall be “conditioned” prior to conducting each interference test series. This requirement includes conditioning for the NO2 converter in chemiluminescence NO/NO2/NOX analyzers and for the ozone scrubber in UV-absorption ozone analyzers. Conditioning is as follows:
              (A) Service or perform the indicated maintenance on the scrubber or prefilter device, as if it were due for such maintenance, as directed in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3).
              (B) Before testing for each potential interferent, allow the test analyzer to sample through the prefilter or scrubber device a test atmosphere containing the interferent at a concentration not lower than the value specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53 (or, for unlisted potential interferents, at a concentration substantially higher than likely to be found in ambient air). Sampling shall be at the normal flow rate and shall be continued for 6 continuous hours prior to the interference test series. Conditioning for all applicable interferents prior to any of the interference tests is permissible. Also permissible is simultaneous conditioning with multiple interferents, provided no interferent reactions are likely to occur in the conditioning system.
              (iii) Generate three test atmosphere streams as follows:
              (A) Test atmosphere P: Pollutant test concentration.
              (B) Test atmosphere I: Interferent test concentration.
              (C) Test atmosphere Z: Zero air.
              (iv) Adjust the individual flow rates and the pollutant or interferent generators for the three test atmospheres as follows:
              (A) The flow rates of test atmospheres I and Z shall be equal.

              (B) The concentration of the pollutant in test atmosphere P shall be adjusted such that when P is mixed (diluted) with either test atmosphere I or Z, the resulting concentration of pollutant shall be as specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53.

              (C) The concentration of the interferent in test atmosphere I shall be adjusted such that when I is mixed (diluted) with test atmosphere P, the resulting concentration of interferent shall be not less than the value specified in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53 (or as otherwise required for unlisted potential interferents).

              (D) To minimize concentration errors due to flow rate differences between I and Z, it is recommended that, when possible, the flow rate of P be from 10 to 20 times larger than the flow rates of I and Z.
              
              (v) Mix test atmospheres P and Z by passing the total flow of both atmospheres through a (passive) mixing component to insure complete mixing of the gases.

              (vi) Sample and measure the mixture of test atmospheres P and Z with the test analyzer. Allow for a stable measurement reading, and record the reading, in concentration units, as R (see Figure B-3).
              (vii) Mix test atmospheres P and I by passing the total flow of both atmospheres through a (passive) mixing component to insure complete mixing of the gases.
              (viii) Sample and measure this mixture of P and I with the test analyzer. Record the stable measurement reading, in concentration units, as R
                I.
              (ix) Calculate the interference equivalent (IE) test result as:
              
              
                IE = R
                I−R.
              
              
              
                IE must be within the limits (inclusive) specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 for each interferent tested to pass the interference equivalent test.
              (x) Follow steps (iii) through (ix) of this section, in turn, to determine the interference equivalent for each listed interferent as well as for any other potential interferents identified.

              (xi) For those potential interferents which cannot be mixed with the pollutant, as indicated by footnote (3) in table B-3 to subpart B of part 53, adjust the concentration of test atmosphere I to the specified value without being mixed or diluted by the pollutant test atmosphere. Determine IE as follows:
              (A) Sample and measure test atmosphere Z (zero air). Allow for a stable measurement reading and record the reading, in concentration units, as R.
              

              (B) Sample and measure the interferent test atmosphere I. If the test analyzer is not capable of negative readings, adjust the analyzer (not the recorder) to give an offset zero. Record the stable reading in concentration units as R
                I, extrapolating the calibration curve, if necessary, to represent negative readings.
              (C) Calculate IE = R
                I
                − R.
                IE must be within the limits (inclusive) specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 for each interferent tested to pass the interference equivalent test.
              (xii) Sum the absolute value of all the individual interference equivalent test results. This sum must be equal to or less than the total interferent limit given in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 to pass the test.
              (e) Zero drift, span drift, lag time, rise time, fall time, and precision—(1) Technical definitions—(i) Zero drift: The change in measurement response to zero pollutant concentration over 12- and 24-hour periods of continuous unadjusted operation.
              (ii) Span drift: The percent change in measurement response to an up-scale pollutant concentration over a 24-hour period of continuous unadjusted operation.
              (iii) Lag time: The time interval between a step change in input concentration and the first observable corresponding change in measurement response.
              (iv) Rise time: The time interval between initial measurement response and 95 percent of final response after a step increase in input concentration.
              (v) Fall time: The time interval between initial measurement response and 95 percent of final response after a step decrease in input concentration.
              (vi) Precision: Variation about the mean of repeated measurements of the same pollutant concentration, denoted as the standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the upper range limits.258
                
              
              
                
                  258 NO2 precision in Table B-1 is also changed to percent to agree with the calculation specified in 53.23(e)(10)(vi).
              
              (2) Tests for these performance parameters shall be accomplished over a period of seven (7) or fifteen (15) test days. During this time, the line voltage supplied to the test analyzer and the ambient temperature surrounding the analyzer shall be changed from day to day, as required in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. One test result for each performance parameter shall be obtained each test day, for seven (7) or fifteen (15) test days, as determined from the test results of the first seven days. The tests for each test day are performed in a single integrated procedure.
              (3) The 24-hour test day may begin at any clock hour. The first approximately 12 hours of each test day are required for testing 12-hour zero drift. Tests for the other parameters shall be conducted any time during the remaining 12 hours.

              (4) Table B-4 to subpart B of part 53 specifies the line voltage and room temperature to be used for each test day. The applicant may elect to specify a wider temperature range (minimum and maximum temperatures) than the range specified in table B-4 to subpart B of part 53 and to conduct these tests over that wider temperature range in lieu of the specified temperature range. If the test results show that all test parameters of this section § 53.23(e) are passed over this wider temperature range, a subsequent FRM or FEM designation for the candidate method based in part on this test shall indicate approval for operation of the method over such wider temperature range. The line voltage and temperature shall be changed to the specified values (or to the alternative, wider temperature values, if applicable) at the start of each test day (i.e., at the start of the 12-hour zero test). Initial adjustments (day zero) shall be made at a line voltage of 115 volts (rms) and a room temperature of 25 °C.

              (5) The tests shall be conducted in blocks consisting of 3 test days each until 7 (or 15, if necessary) test results have been obtained. (The final block may contain fewer than three test days.) Test days need not be contiguous days, but during any idle time between tests or test days, the test analyzer must operate continuously and measurements must be recorded continuously at a low chart speed (or equivalent data recording) and included with the test data. If a test is interrupted by an occurrence other than a malfunction of the test analyzer, only the block during which the interruption occurred shall be repeated.
              (6) During each test block, manual adjustments to the electronics, gas, or reagent flows or periodic maintenance shall not be permitted. Automatic adjustments that the test analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time.
              (7) At least 4 hours prior to the start of the first test day of each test block, the test analyzer may be adjusted and/or serviced according to the periodic maintenance procedures specified in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). If a new block is to immediately follow a previous block, such adjustments or servicing may be done immediately after completion of the day's tests for the last day of the previous block and at the voltage and temperature specified for that day, but only on test days 3, 6, 9, and 12.
              
                Note to § 53.23(e)(7):
                If necessary, the beginning of the test days succeeding such maintenance or adjustment may be delayed as required to complete the service or adjustment operation.
              
              (8) All measurement response readings to be recorded shall be converted to concentration units or adjusted (if necessary) according to the calibration curve. Whenever a test atmosphere is to be measured but a stable reading is not required, the test atmosphere shall be sampled and measured long enough to cause a change in measurement response of at least 10% of full scale. Identify all readings and other pertinent data on the strip chart (or equivalent test data record). (See Figure B-1 to subpart B of part 53 illustrating the pattern of the required readings.)
              (9) Test procedure. (i) Arrange to generate pollutant test atmospheres as follows. Test atmospheres A
                0, A
                20, and A

The actual chart speed, chart speed changes, and time checks shall be clearly marked on the chart.
              (iii) Test day 0. Allow sufficient time for the test analyzer to warm up and stabilize at a line voltage of 115 volts and a room temperature of 25 °C. Adjust the zero baseline to 5 percent of chart (see § 53.21(b)) and recalibrate, if necessary. No further adjustments shall be made to the analyzer until the end of the tests on the third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth test day.

              (viii) At the beginning of each test day, adjust the line voltage and room temperature to the values given in table B-4 to subpart B of part 53 (or to the corresponding alternative temperature if a wider temperature range is being tested).

              (xxxv) If zero and span adjustments are made after the readings are taken on test days 3, 6, 9, or 12, complete all adjustments; then measure test atmospheres A
                0 and A

              (i) Zero drift. (A) Determine the 12-hour zero drift by examining the strip chart pertaining to the 12-hour continuous zero air test. Determine the minimum (C
                min.) and maximum (C
                max.) measurement readings (in ppm) during this period of 12 consecutive hours, extrapolating the calibration curve to negative concentration units if necessary. Calculate the 12-hour zero drift (12ZD) as 12ZD = C
                max. − C
                min. (See Figure B-5 in appendix A.)
              (B) Calculate the 24-hour zero drift (24ZD) for the n-th test day as 24ZD
                n

                n
                − Z'
                n-1 if zero adjustment was made on the previous test day, where Z
                n = 1/2(L

                1 and L
                2 taken on the n-th test day.
              (C) Compare 12ZD and 24ZD to the zero drift limit specifications in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53. Both 12ZD and 24ZD must be within the specified limits (inclusive) to pass the test for zero drift.
              (ii) Span drift.
              
              (A) Calculate the span drift (SD) as:
              
                ER31AU11.006
              
              or if a span adjustment was made on the previous test day,
              
                
                ER31AU11.007
              
              where
              
                ER31AU11.008
              
              
              
                n indicates the n-th test day, and i indicates the i-th measurement reading on the n-th test day.

Determine, from the strip chart (or alternative test data record), the elapsed time in minutes between the change in test concentration (or mark) made in step (xxvi) and the first observable (two times the noise level) measurement response. This time must be equal to or less than the lag time limit specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 to pass the test for lag time.
              (iv) Rise time. Calculate 95 percent of measurement reading P
                9 and determine, from the recorder chart (or alternative test data record), the elapsed time between the first observable (two times noise level) measurement response and a response equal to 95 percent of the P
                9 reading. This time must be equal to or less than the rise time limit specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 to pass the test for rise time.
              (v) Fall time. Calculate five percent of (P
                10 − L
                2) and determine, from the strip chart (or alternative test record), the elapsed time in minutes between the first observable decrease in measurement response following reading P
                10 and a response equal to L
                2 + five percent of (P
                10 − L
                2). This time must be equal to or less than the fall time limit specification in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 to pass the test for fall time.
              (vi) Precision. Calculate precision (both P
                20 and P
                80) for each test day as follows:
              (A)
              
                ER31AU11.009
              
              (B)
              
                ER31AU11.010
              
              
              (C) Both P
                20 and P
                80 must be equal to or less than the precision limits specified in table B-1 to subpart B of part 53 to pass the test for precision.

              Source:
              71 FR 61278, Oct. 17, 2006, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 53.30
              General provisions.
              (a) Determination of comparability. The test procedures prescribed in this subpart shall be used to determine if a candidate method is comparable to a reference method when both methods measure pollutant concentrations in ambient air. Minor deviations in testing requirements and acceptance requirements set forth in this subpart, in connection with any documented extenuating circumstances, may be determined by the Administrator to be acceptable, at the discretion of the Administrator.
              (b) Selection of test sites. (1) Each test site shall be in an area which can be shown to have at least moderate concentrations of various pollutants. Each site shall be clearly identified and shall be justified as an appropriate test site with suitable supporting evidence such as a description of the surrounding area, characterization of the sources and pollutants typical in the area, maps, population density data, vehicular traffic data, emission inventories, pollutant measurements from previous years, concurrent pollutant measurements, meteorological data, and other information useful in supporting the suitability of the site for the comparison test or tests.
              (2) If approval of one or more proposed test sites is desired prior to conducting the tests, a written request for approval of the test site or sites must be submitted to the address given in § 53.4. The request should include information identifying the type of candidate method and one or more specific proposed test sites along with a justification for each proposed specific site as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The EPA will evaluate each proposed site and approve the site, disapprove the site, or request more information about the site. Any such pre-test approval of a test site by the EPA shall indicate only that the site meets the applicable test site requirements for the candidate method type; it shall not indicate, suggest, or imply that test data obtained at the site will necessarily meet any of the applicable data acceptance requirements. The Administrator may exercise discretion in selecting a different site (or sites) for any additional tests the Administrator decides to conduct.
              (c) Test atmosphere. Ambient air sampled at an appropriate test site or sites shall be used for these tests. Simultaneous concentration measurements shall be made in each of the concentration ranges specified in tables C-1, C-3, or C-4 of this subpart, as appropriate.
              (d) Sampling or sample collection. All test concentration measurements or samples shall be taken in such a way that both the candidate method and the reference method obtain air samples that are alike or as nearly identical as practical.
              (e) Operation. Set-up and start-up of the test analyzer(s), test sampler(s), and reference method analyzers or samplers shall be in strict accordance with the applicable operation manual(s).
              (f) Calibration. The reference method shall be calibrated according to the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter (if it is a manual method) or according to the applicable operation manual(s) (if it is an automated method). A candidate method (or portion thereof) shall be calibrated according to the applicable operation manual(s), if such calibration is a part of the method.
              (g) Submission of test data and other information. All recorder charts, calibration data, records, test results, procedural descriptions and details, and other documentation obtained from (or pertinent to) these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and submitted. For candidate methods for PM 2.5 and PM 10-2.5, all submitted information must meet the requirements of the ANSI/ASQC E4 Standard, sections 6 (reference 1 of appendix A of this subpart).

              § 53.32
              Test procedures for methods for SO2, CO, O3, and NO2.
              (a) Comparability. Comparability is shown for SO2, CO, O3, and NO2 methods when the differences between:
              (1) Measurements made by a candidate manual method or by a test analyzer representative of a candidate automated method, and;
              (2) Measurements made simultaneously by a reference method are less than or equal to the values for maximum discrepancy specified in table C-1 of this subpart.
              (b) Test measurements. All test measurements are to be made at the same test site. If necessary, the concentration of pollutant in the sampled ambient air may be augmented with artificially generated pollutant to facilitate measurements in the specified ranges, as described under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
              (c) Requirements for measurements or samples. All test measurements made or test samples collected by means of a sample manifold as specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section shall be at a room temperature between 20° and 30 °C, and at a line voltage between 105 and 125 volts. All methods shall be calibrated as specified in § 53.30(f) prior to initiation of the tests.
              
              (d) Set-up and start-up. (1) Set-up and start-up of the test analyzer, test sampler(s), and reference method shall be in strict accordance with the applicable operation manual(s). If the test analyzer does not have an integral strip chart or digital data recorder, connect the analyzer output to a suitable strip chart or digital data recorder. This recorder shall have a chart width of at least 25 centimeters, a response time of 1 second or less, a deadband of not more than 0.25 percent of full scale, and capability of either reading measurements at least 5 percent below zero or offsetting the zero by at least 5 percent. Digital data shall be recorded at appropriate time intervals such that trend plots similar to a strip chart recording may be constructed with a similar or suitable level of detail.
              (2) Other data acquisition components may be used along with the chart recorder during the conduct of these tests. Use of the chart recorder is intended only to facilitate visual evaluation of data submitted.
              (3) Allow adequate warmup or stabilization time as indicated in the applicable operation manual(s) before beginning the tests.
              (e) Range. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each method shall be operated in the range specified for the reference method in the appropriate appendix to part 50 of this chapter (for manual reference methods), or specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part (for automated reference methods).

              (2) For a candidate method having more than one selectable range, one range must be that specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, and a test analyzer representative of the method must pass the tests required by this subpart while operated on that range. The tests may be repeated for one or more broader ranges (i.e., ones extending to higher concentrations) than the one specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, provided that such a range does not extend to concentrations more than four times the upper range limit specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part and that the test analyzer has passed the tests required by subpart B of this part (if applicable) for the broader range. If the tests required by this subpart are conducted or passed only for the range specified in table B-1 of subpart B of this part, any equivalent method determination with respect to the method will be limited to that range. If the tests are passed for both the specified range and a broader range (or ranges), any such determination will include the broader range(s) as well as the specified range. Appropriate test data shall be submitted for each range sought to be included in such a determination.
              (f) Operation of automated methods. (1) Once the test analyzer has been set up and calibrated and tests started, manual adjustment or normal periodic maintenance, as specified in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3), is permitted only every 3 days. Automatic adjustments which the test analyzer performs by itself are permitted at any time. The submitted records shall show clearly when manual adjustments were made and describe the operations performed.
              (2) All test measurements shall be made with the same test analyzer; use of multiple test analyzers is not permitted. The test analyzer shall be operated continuously during the entire series of test measurements.
              (3) If a test analyzer should malfunction during any of these tests, the entire set of measurements shall be repeated, and a detailed explanation of the malfunction, remedial action taken, and whether recalibration was necessary (along with all pertinent records and charts) shall be submitted.

              (4) Ambient air shall be sampled from a common intake and distribution manifold designed to deliver homogenous air samples to both methods. Precautions shall be taken in the design and construction of this manifold to minimize the removal of particulate matter and trace gases, and to insure that identical samples reach the two methods. If necessary, the concentration of pollutant in the sampled ambient air may be augmented with artificially generated pollutant. However, at all times the air sample measured by the candidate and reference methods under test shall consist of not less than 80 percent ambient air by volume. Schematic drawings, physical illustrations, descriptions, and complete details of the manifold system and the augmentation system (if used) shall be submitted.
              (g) Tests. (1) Conduct the first set of simultaneous measurements with the candidate and reference methods:
              (i) Table C-1 of this subpart specifies the type (1-or 24-hour) and number of measurements to be made in each of the three test concentration ranges.
              (ii) The pollutant concentration must fall within the specified range as measured by the reference method.
              (iii) The measurements shall be made in the sequence specified in table C-2 of this subpart.
              (2) For each pair of measurements, determine the difference (discrepancy) between the candidate method measurement and reference method measurement. A discrepancy which exceeds the discrepancy specified in table C-1 of this subpart constitutes a failure. Figure C-1 of this subpart contains a suggested format for reporting the test results.
              (3) The results of the first set of measurements shall be interpreted as follows:
              (i) Zero failures: The candidate method passes the test for comparability.
              (ii) Three or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for comparability.
              (iii) One or two failures: Conduct a second set of simultaneous measurements as specified in table C-1 of this subpart. The results of the combined total of first-set and second-set measurements shall be interpreted as follows:
              (A) One or two failures: The candidate method passes the test for comparability.
              (B) Three or more failures: The candidate method fails the test for comparability.
              (iv) For SO2, the 1-hour and 24-hour measurements shall be interpreted separately, and the candidate method must pass the tests for both 1- and 24-hour measurements to pass the test for comparability.
              (4) A 1-hour measurement consists of the integral of the instantaneous concentration over a 60-minute continuous period divided by the time period. Integration of the instantaneous concentration may be performed by any appropriate means such as chemical, electronic, mechanical, visual judgment, or by calculating the mean of not less than 12 equally-spaced instantaneous readings. Appropriate allowances or corrections shall be made in cases where significant errors could occur due to characteristic lag time or rise/fall time differences between the candidate and reference methods. Details of the means of integration and any corrections shall be submitted.
              (5) A 24-hour measurement consists of the integral of the instantaneous concentration over a 24-hour continuous period divided by the time period. This integration may be performed by any appropriate means such as chemical, electronic, mechanical, or by calculating the mean of twenty-four (24) sequential 1-hour measurements.
              (6) For O3 and CO, no more than six 1-hour measurements shall be made per day. For SO2, no more than four 1-hour measurements or one 24-hour measurement shall be made per day. One-hour measurements may be made concurrently with 24-hour measurements if appropriate.
              (7) For applicable methods, control or calibration checks may be performed once per day without adjusting the test analyzer or method. These checks may be used as a basis for a linear interpolation-type correction to be applied to the measurements to correct for drift. If such a correction is used, it shall be applied to all measurements made with the method, and the correction procedure shall become a part of the method.

              § 53.33
              Test Procedure for Methods for Lead (Pb).
              (a) General. The reference method for Pb in TSP includes two parts, the reference method for high-volume sampling of TSP as specified in 40 CFR 50, appendix B and the analysis method for Pb in TSP as specified in 40 CFR 50, appendix G. Correspondingly, the reference method for Pb in PM 10 includes the reference method for low-volume sampling of PM 10 in 40 CFR 50, appendix O and the analysis method of Pb in PM 10 as specified in 40 CFR 50, appendix Q. This section explains the procedures for demonstrating the equivalence of either a candidate method for Pb in TSP to the high-volume reference methods, or a candidate method for Pb in PM 10 to the low-volume reference methods.
              (1) Pb in TSP—A candidate method for Pb in TSP specifies reporting of Pb concentrations in terms of standard temperature and pressure. Comparisons of candidate methods to the reference method in 40 CFR 50, appendix G must be made in a consistent manner with regard to temperature and pressure.
              (2) Pb in PM 10—A candidate method for Pb in PM 10 must specify reporting of Pb concentrations in terms of local conditions of temperature and pressure, which will be compared to similarly reported concentrations from the reference method in 40 CFR 50 appendix Q.
              (b) Comparability. Comparability is shown for Pb methods when the differences between:
              (1) Measurements made by a candidate method, and
              (2) Measurements made by the reference method on simultaneously collected Pb samples (or the same sample, if applicable), are less than or equal to the values specified in table C-3 of this subpart.
              (c) Test measurements. Test measurements may be made at any number of test sites. Augmentation of pollutant concentrations is not permitted, hence an appropriate test site or sites must be selected to provide Pb concentrations in the specified range.
              (d) Collocated samplers. The ambient air intake points of all the candidate and reference method collocated samplers shall be positioned at the same height above the ground level, and between 2 meters (1 meter for samplers with flow rates less than 200 liters per minute (L/min)) and 4 meters apart. The samplers shall be oriented in a manner that will minimize spatial and wind directional effects on sample collection.
              (e) Sample collection. Collect simultaneous 24-hour samples of Pb at the test site or sites with both the reference and candidate methods until at least 10 sample pairs have been obtained.
              (1) A candidate method for Pb in TSP which employs a sampler and sample collection procedure that are identical to the sampler and sample collection procedure specified in the reference method in 40 CFR part 50, Appendix B, but uses a different analytical procedure than specified in 40 CFR Appendix G, may be tested by analyzing pairs of filter strips taken from a single TSP reference sampler operated according to the procedures specified by that reference method.
              (2) A candidate method for Pb in PM 10 which employs a sampler and sample collection procedure that are identical to the sampler and sample collection procedure specified in the reference method in 40 CFR part 50, Appendix O, but uses a different analytical procedure than specified in 40 CFR Appendix Q, requires the use of two PM 10 reference samplers because a single 46.2-mm filter from a reference sampler may not be divided prior to analysis. It is possible to analyze a 46.2-mm filter first with the non-destructive X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) FRM and subsequently extract the filter for other analytical techniques. If the filter is subject to XRF with subsequent extraction for other analyses, then a single PM 10 reference sampler may be used for sample collection.
              (3) A candidate method for Pb in TSP or Pb in PM 10 which employs a direct reading (e.g., continuous or semi-continuous sampling) method that uses the same sampling inlet and flow rate as the FRM and the same or different analytical procedure may be tested. The direct measurements are then aggregated to 24-hour equivalent concentrations for comparison with the FRM. For determining precision in section (k), two collocated direct reading devices must be used.
              (f) Audit samples. Three audit samples must be obtained from the address given in § 53.4(a). For Pb in TSP collected by the high-volume sampling method, the audit samples are 3/4 × 8-inch glass fiber strips containing known amounts of Pb in micrograms per strip (µg/strip) equivalent to the following nominal percentages of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS): 30%, 100%, and 250%. For Pb in PM 10 collected by the low-volume sampling method, the audit samples are 46.2-mm polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) filters containing known amounts of Pb in micrograms per filter (µg/filter) equivalent to the same percentages of the NAAQS: 30%, 100%, and 250%. The true amount of Pb (Tqi), in total µg/strip (for TSP) or total µg/filter (for PM 10), will be provided for each audit sample.
              (g) Filter analysis. (1) For both the reference method samples (e) and the audit samples (f), analyze each filter or filter extract three times in accordance with the reference method analytical procedure. This applies to both the Pb in TSP and Pb in PM 10 methods. The analysis of replicates should not be performed sequentially, i.e., a single sample should not be analyzed three times in sequence. Calculate the indicated Pb concentrations for the reference method samples in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) for each analysis of each filter. Calculate the indicated total Pb amount for the audit samples in µg/strip for each analysis of each strip or µg/filter for each analysis of each audit filter. Label these test results as R1A, R1B, R1C, R2A, R2B, etc., Q1A, Q1B, Q1C, etc., where R denotes results from the reference method samples; Q denotes results from the audit samples; 1, 2, 3 indicate the filter number, and A, B, C indicate the first, second, and third analysis of each filter, respectively.

              (2) For the candidate method samples, analyze each sample filter or filter extract three times and calculate, in accordance with the candidate method, the indicated Pb concentration in µg/m 3 for each analysis of each filter. The analysis of replicates should not be performed sequentially. Label these test results as C1A, C1B, C2C, etc., where C denotes results from the candidate method. For candidate methods which provide a direct reading or measurement of Pb concentrations without a separable procedure, C1A = C1B = C1C, C2A = C2B = C2C, etc.
              (h) Average Pb concentration. For the reference method, calculate the average Pb concentration for each filter by averaging the concentrations calculated from the three analyses as described in (g)(1) using equation 1 of this section:
              
                ER12NO08.003
              
              
                Where, i is the filter number.
              
              
              (i) Analytical Bias. (1) For the audit samples, calculate the average Pb concentration for each strip or filter analyzed by the reference method by averaging the concentrations calculated from the three analyses as described in (g)(1) using equation 2 of this section:
              
                ER12NO08.004
              
              
                Where, i is audit sample number.
              
              
              (2) Calculate the percent difference (Dq) between the average Pb concentration for each audit sample and the true Pb concentration (Tq) using equation 3 of this section:
              
                ER12NO08.005
              
              (3) If any difference value (Dqi) exceeds ±5 percent, the bias of the reference method analytical procedure is out-of-control. Corrective action must be taken to determine the source of the error(s) (e.g., calibration standard discrepancies, extraction problems, etc.) and the reference method and audit sample determinations must be repeated according to paragraph (g) of this section, or the entire test procedure (starting with paragraph (e) of this section) must be repeated.
              (j) Acceptable filter pairs. Disregard all filter pairs for which the Pb concentration, as determined in paragraph (h) of this section by the average of the three reference method determinations, falls outside the range of 30% to 250% of the Pb NAAQS level in µg/m3 for Pb in both TSP and PM 10. All remaining filter pairs must be subjected to the tests for precision and comparability in paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section. At least five filter pairs must be within the specified concentration range for the tests to be valid.
              (k) Test for precision. (1) Calculate the precision (P) of the analysis (in percent) for each filter and for each method, as the maximum minus the minimum divided by the average of the three concentration values, using equation 4 or equation 5 of this section:
              
                ER12NO08.006
              
              
                Where, i indicates the filter number.
              
              
              (2) If a direct reading candidate method is tested, the precision is determined from collocated devices using equation 5 above.
              (3) If any reference method precision value (PRi) exceeds 15 percent, the precision of the reference method analytical procedure is out-of-control. Corrective action must be taken to determine the source(s) of imprecision, and the reference method determinations must be repeated according to paragraph (g) of this section, or the entire test procedure (starting with paragraph (e) of this section) must be repeated.
              (4) If any candidate method precision value (PCi) exceeds 15 percent, the candidate method fails the precision test.

              (5) The candidate method passes this test if all precision values (i.e., all PRi's and all PCi's) are less than 15 percent.
              (l) Test for comparability. (1) For each filter or analytical sample pair, calculate all nine possible percent differences (D) between the reference and candidate methods, using all nine possible combinations of the three determinations (A, B, and C) for each method using equation 6 of this section:
              
                ER12NO08.007
              
              
                Where, i is the filter number, and n numbers from 1 to 9 for the nine possible difference combinations for the three determinations for each method (j = A, B, C, candidate; k = A, B, C, reference).
              
              
              (2) If none of the percent differences (D) exceeds ±20 percent, the candidate method passes the test for comparability.
              (3) If one or more of the percent differences (D) exceed ±20 percent, the candidate method fails the test for comparability.
              (4) The candidate method must pass both the precision test (paragraph (k) of this section) and the comparability test (paragraph (l) of this section) to qualify for designation as an equivalent method.
              (m) Method Detection Limit (MDL). Calculate the estimated MDL using the guidance provided in 40 CFR, Part 136 Appendix B. It is essential that all sample processing steps of the analytical method be included in the determination of the method detection limit. Take a minimum of seven blank filters from each lot to be used and calculate the detection limit by processing each through the entire candidate analytical method. Make all computations according to the defined method with the final results in µg/m3. The MDL of the candidate method must be equal to, or less than 5% of the level of the Pb NAAQS.
              [73 FR 67057, Nov. 12, 2008]
            
            
              § 53.34
              Test procedure for methods for PM 10 and Class I methods for PM 2.5.
              (a) Comparability. Comparability is shown for PM 10 methods and for Class I methods for PM 2.5 when the relationship between:
              (1) Measurements made by a candidate method, and

              (2) Measurements made by a corresponding reference method on simultaneously collected samples (or the same sample, if applicable) at each of one or more test sites (as required) is such that the linear regression parameters (slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient) describing the relationship meet the requirements specified in table C-4 of this subpart.
              (b) Methods for PM
                10. Test measurements must be made, or derived from particulate samples collected, at not less than two test sites, each of which must be located in a geographical area characterized by ambient particulate matter that is significantly different in nature and composition from that at the other test site(s). Augmentation of pollutant concentrations is not permitted, hence appropriate test sites must be selected to provide the minimum number of test PM 10 concentrations in the ranges specified in table C-4 of this subpart. The tests at the two sites may be conducted in different calendar seasons, if appropriate, to provide PM 10 concentrations in the specified ranges.
              (c) PM
                10
                methods employing the same sampling procedure as the reference method but a different analytical method. Candidate methods for PM 10 which employ a sampler and sample collection procedure that are identical to the sampler and sample collection procedure specified in the reference method, but use a different analytical procedure, may be tested by analyzing common samples. The common samples shall be collected according to the sample collection procedure specified by the reference method and shall be analyzed in accordance with the analytical procedures of both the candidate method and the reference method.
              (d) Methods for PM
                2.5. Augmentation of pollutant concentrations is not permitted, hence appropriate test sites must be selected to provide the minimum number of test measurement sets to meet the requirements for PM 2.5 concentrations in the ranges specified in table C-4 of this subpart. Only one test site is required, and the site need only meet the PM 2.5 ambient concentration levels required by table C-4 of this subpart and the requirements of § 53.30(b) of this subpart. A total of 10 valid measurement sets is required.
              (e) Collocated measurements. (1) Set up three reference method samplers collocated with three candidate method samplers or analyzers at each of the number of test sites specified in table C-4 of this subpart.
              (2) The ambient air intake points of all the candidate and reference method collocated samplers or analyzers shall be positioned at the same height above the ground level, and between 2 meters (1 meter for samplers or analyzers with flow rates less than 200 L/min) and 4 meters apart. The samplers shall be oriented in a manner that will minimize spatial and wind directional effects on sample collection.

              (3) At each site, obtain as many sets of simultaneous PM 10 or PM 2.5 measurements as necessary (see table C-4 of this subpart), each set consisting of three reference method and three candidate method measurements, all obtained simultaneously.
              (4) Candidate PM 10 method measurements shall be nominal 24-hour (±1 hour) integrated measurements or shall be averaged to obtain the mean concentration for a nominal 24-hour period. PM 2.5 measurements may be either nominal 24-or 48-hour integrated measurements. All collocated measurements in a measurement set must cover the same nominal 24-or 48-hour time period.

              (5) For samplers, retrieve the samples promptly after sample collection and analyze each sample according to the reference method or candidate method, as appropriate, and determine the PM 10 or PM 2.5 concentration in µg/m3. If the conditions of paragraph (c) of this section apply, collect sample sets only with the three reference method samplers. Guidance for quality assurance procedures for PM 2.5 methods is found in “Quality Assurance Document 2.12” (reference (2) in appendix A to this subpart).
              (f) Sequential samplers. For sequential samplers, the sampler shall be configured for the maximum number of sequential samples and shall be set for automatic collection of all samples sequentially such that the test samples are collected equally, to the extent possible, among all available sequential channels or utilizing the full available sequential capability.
              (g) Calculation of reference method averages and precisions. (1) For each of the measurement sets, calculate the average PM 10 or PM 2.5 concentration obtained with the reference method samplers, using equation 7 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.021
              
              
                Where:
                
                R = The concentration measurements from the reference methods;
                i = The sampler number; and
                j = The measurement set number.
              
              

              (2) For each of the measurement sets, calculate the precision of the reference method PM 10 or PM 2.5 measurements as the standard deviation, PRj, using equation 8 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.022
              

              (3) For each measurement set, also calculate the precision of the reference method PM 10 or PM 2.5 measurements as the relative standard deviation, RPRj, in percent, using equation 9 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.023
              
              (h) Acceptability of measurement sets. Each measurement set is acceptable and valid only if the three reference method measurements and the three candidate method measurements are obtained and are valid, R
                j falls within the acceptable concentration range specified in table C-4 of this subpart, and either PRj or RPRj is within the corresponding limit for reference method precision specified in table C-4 of this subpart. For each site, table C-4 of this subpart specifies the minimum number of measurement sets required having R
                j above and below specified concentrations for 24- or 48-hour samples. Additional measurement sets shall be obtained, as necessary, to provide the minimum number of acceptable measurement sets for each category and the minimum total number of acceptable measurement sets for each test site. If more than the minimum number of measurement sets are collected that meet the acceptability criteria, all such measurement sets shall be used to demonstrate comparability.
              (i) Candidate method average concentration measurement. For each of the acceptable measurement sets, calculate the average PM 10 or PM 2.5 concentration measurements obtained with the candidate method samplers, using equation 10 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.024
              
              
                Where:
                
                C = The concentration measurements from the candidate methods;
                i = The measurement number in the set; and
                j = The measurement set number.
              
              
              (j) Test for comparability. (1) For each site, plot all of the average PM 10 or PM 2.5 measurements obtained with the candidate method (C
                j) against the corresponding average PM 10 or PM 2.5 measurements obtained with the reference method (R
                j. For each site, calculate and record the linear regression slope and intercept, and the correlation coefficient.
              (2) To pass the test for comparability, the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient calculated under paragraph (j)(1) of this section must be within the limits specified in table C-4 of this subpart for all test sites.
            
            
              § 53.35

              Test procedure for Class II and Class III methods for PM 2.5 and PM −2.5.
              (a) Overview. Class II and Class III candidate equivalent methods shall be tested for comparability of PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 measurements to corresponding collocated PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 reference method measurements at each of multiple field sites, as required. Comparability is shown for the candidate method when simultaneous collocated measurements made by candidate and reference methods meet the comparability requirements specified in this section § 53.35 and in table C-4 of this subpart at each of the required test sites.
              (b) Test sites and seasons. A summary of the test site and seasonal testing requirements is presented in table C-5 of this subpart.
              (1) Test sites. Comparability testing is required at each of the applicable U.S. test sites required by this paragraph (b). Each test site must also meet the general test site requirements specified in § 53.30(b).
              (i) PM
                2.5
                Class II and Class III candidate methods. Test sites should be chosen to provide representative chemical and meteorological characteristics with respect to nitrates, sulfates, organic compounds, and various levels of temperature, humidity, wind, and elevation. For Class III methods, one test site shall be selected in each of the following four general locations (A, B, C, and D). For Class II methods, two test sites, one western site (A or B) and one midwestern or eastern site (C or D), shall be selected from these locations.

              (A) Test site A shall be in the Los Angeles basin or California Central Valley area in a location that is characterized by relatively high PM 2.5, nitrates, and semi-volatile organic pollutants.
              (B) Test site B shall be in a western city such as Denver, Salt Lake City, or Albuquerque in an area characterized by cold weather, higher elevation, winds, and dust.
              (C) Test site C shall be in a midwestern city characterized by substantial temperature variation, high nitrates, and wintertime conditions.
              (D) Test site D shall be in a northeastern or mid-Atlantic city that is seasonally characterized by high sulfate concentrations and high relative humidity.
              (ii) PM
                10-2.5
                Class II and Class III candidate methods. Test sites shall be chosen to provide modest to high levels of PM 10-2.5 representative of locations in proximity to urban sources of PM 10-2.5 such as high-density traffic on paved roads, industrial sources, and construction activities. For Class III methods, one test site shall be selected in each of the four following general locations (A, B, C, and D), and at least one of the test sites shall have characteristic wintertime temperatures of 0 °C or lower. For Class II methods, two test sites, one western site (A or B) and one midwestern or eastern site (C or D), shall be selected from these locations.

              (A) Test site A shall be in the Los Angeles basin or the California Central Valley area in a location that is characterized by relatively high PM 2.5, nitrates, and semi-volatile organic pollutants.

              (B) Test site B shall be in a western city characterized by a high ratio of PM 10-2.5 to PM 2.5, with exposure to windblown dust, such as Las Vegas or Phoenix.
              (C) Test site C shall be in a midwestern city characterized by substantial temperature variation, high nitrates, and wintertime conditions.
              (D) Test site D shall be in a large city east of the Mississippi River, having characteristically high sulfate concentrations and high humidity levels.
              (2) Test seasons. (i) For PM 2.5 and PM 10-2.5 Class III candidate methods, test campaigns are required in both summer and winter seasons at test site A, in the winter season only at test sites B and C, and in the summer season only at test site D. (A total of five test campaigns is required.) The summer season shall be defined as the typically warmest three or four months of the year at the site; the winter season shall be defined as the typically coolest three or four months of the year at the site.
              (ii) For Class II PM 2.5 and PM 10-2.5 candidate methods, one test campaign is required at test site A or B and a second test campaign at test site C or D (total of two test campaigns).
              (3) Test concentrations. The test sites should be selected to provide ambient concentrations within the concentration limits specified in table C-4 of this subpart, and also to provide a wide range of test concentrations. A narrow range of test concentrations may result in a low concentration coefficient of variation statistic for the test measurements, making the test for correlation coefficient more difficult to pass (see paragraph (h) of this section, test for comparison correlation).
              (4) Pre-approval of test sites. The EPA recommends that the applicant seek EPA approval of each proposed test site prior to conducting test measurements at the site. To do so, the applicant should submit a request for approval as described in § 53.30(b)(2).
              (c) Collocated measurements. (1) For each test campaign, three reference method samplers and three candidate method samplers or analyzers shall be installed and operated concurrently at each test site within each required season (if applicable), as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. All reference method samplers shall be of single-filter design (not multi-filter, sequential sample design). Each candidate method shall be setup and operated in accordance with its associated manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3) and in accordance with applicable guidance in “Quality Assurance Document 2.12” (reference (2) in appendix A to this subpart). All samplers or analyzers shall be placed so that they sample or measure air representative of the surrounding area (within one kilometer) and are not unduly affected by adjacent buildings, air handling equipment, industrial operations, traffic, or other local influences. The ambient air inlet points of all samplers and analyzers shall be positioned at the same height above the ground level and between 2 meters (1 meter for instruments having sample inlet flow rates less than 200 L/min) and 4 meters apart.

              (2) A minimum of 23 valid and acceptable measurement sets of PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 24-hour (nominal) concurrent concentration measurements shall be obtained during each test campaign at each test site. To be considered acceptable for the test, each measurement set shall consist of at least two valid reference method measurements and at least two valid candidate method measurements, and the PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 measured concentration, as determined by the average of the reference method measurements, must fall within the acceptable concentration range specified in table C-4 of this subpart. Each measurement set shall include all valid measurements obtained. For each measurement set containing fewer than three reference method measurements or fewer than three candidate method measurements, an explanation and appropriate justification shall be provided to account for the missing measurement or measurements.
              (3) More than 23 valid measurement sets may be obtained during a particular test campaign to provide a more advantageous range of concentrations, more representative conditions, additional higher or lower measurements, or to otherwise improve the comparison of the methods. All valid data sets obtained during each test campaign shall be submitted and shall be included in the analysis of the data.

              (4) The integrated-sample reference method measurements shall be of at least 22 hours and not more than 25 hours duration. Each reference method sample shall be retrieved promptly after sample collection and analyzed according to the reference method to determine the PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 measured concentration in µg/m3. Guidance and quality assurance procedures applicable to PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 reference methods are found in “Quality Assurance Document 2.12” (reference (2) in appendix A to this subpart).
              (5) Candidate method measurements shall be timed or processed and averaged as appropriate to determine an equivalent mean concentration representative of the same time period as that of the concurrent integrated-sample reference method measurements, such that all measurements in a measurement set shall be representative of the same time period. In addition, hourly average concentration measurements shall be obtained from each of the Class III candidate method analyzers for each valid measurement set and submitted as part of the application records.

              (6) In the following tests, all measurement sets obtained at a particular test site, from both seasonal campaigns if applicable, shall be combined and included in the test data analysis for the site. Data obtained at different test sites shall be analyzed separately. All measurements should be reported as normally obtained, and no measurement values should be rounded or truncated prior to data analysis. In particular, no negative measurement value, if otherwise apparently valid, should be modified, adjusted, replaced, or eliminated merely because its value is negative. Calculated mean concentrations or calculated intermediate quantities should retain at least one order-of-magnitude greater resolution than the input values. All measurement data and calculations shall be recorded and submitted in accordance with § 53.30(g), including hourly test measurements obtained from Class III candidate methods.
              (d) Calculation of mean concentrations—(1) Reference method outlier test. For each of the measurement sets for each test site, check each reference method measurement to see if it might be an anomalous value (outlier) as follows, where Ri,j is the measurement of reference method sampler i on test day j. In the event that one of the reference method measurements is missing or invalid due to a specific, positively-identified physical cause (e.g., sampler malfunction, operator error, accidental damage to the filter, etc.; see paragraph (c)(2) of this section), then substitute zero for the missing measurement, for the purposes of this outlier test only.
              
              (i) Calculate the quantities 2 × R1,j/(R1,j + R2,j) and 2 × R1,j/(R1,j + R3,j). If both quantities fall outside of the interval, (0.93, 1.07), then R1,j is an outlier.
              (ii) Calculate the quantities 2 × R2,j/(R2,j + R1,j) and 2 × R2,j/(R2,j + R3,j). If both quantities fall outside of the interval, (0.93, 1.07), then R2,j is an outlier.
              (iii) Calculate the quantities 2 × R3,j/(R3,j + R1,j) and 2 × R3,j/(R3,j + R2,j). If both quantities fall outside of the interval, (0.93, 1.07), then R3,j is an outlier.
              (iv) If this test indicates that one of the reference method measurements in the measurement set is an outlier, the outlier measurement shall be eliminated from the measurement set, and the other two measurements considered valid. If the test indicates that more than one reference method measurement in the measurement set is an outlier, the entire measurement set (both reference and candidate method measurements) shall be excluded from further data analysis for the tests of this section.
              (2) For each of the measurement sets for each test site, calculate the mean concentration for the reference method measurements, using equation 11 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.025
              
              
                Where:
                
                R
                  j = The mean concentration measured by the reference method for the measurement set;
                Ri,j = The measurement of reference method sampler i on test day j; and
                n = The number of valid reference method measurements in the measurement set (normally 3).
              
              
              (3) Any measurement set for which R
                j does not fall in the acceptable concentration range specified in table C-4 of this subpart is not valid, and the entire measurement set (both reference and candidate method measurements) must be eliminated from further data analysis.
              (4) For each of the valid measurement sets at each test site, calculate the mean concentration for the candidate method measurements, using equation 12 of this section. (The outlier test in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not be applied to the candidate method measurements.)
              
                ER41AD07.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                Cj = The mean concentration measured by the candidate method for the measurement set;
                Ci,j = The measurement of the candidate method sampler or analyzer i on test day j; and
                m = The number of valid candidate method measurements in the measurement set (normally 3).
              
              
              (e) Test for reference method precision. (1) For each of the measurement sets for each site, calculate an estimate for the relative precision of the reference method measurements, RPj, using equation 13 of this section:
              
                ER41AD07.001
              

              (2) For each site, calculate an estimate of reference method relative precision for the site, RP, using the root mean square calculation of equation 14 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.028
              
              
                Where, J is the total number of valid measurement sets for the site.
              
              
              (3) Verify that the estimate for reference method relative precision for the site, RP, is not greater than the value specified for reference method precision in table C-4 of this subpart. A reference method relative precision greater than the value specified in table C-4 of this subpart indicates that quality control for the reference method is inadequate, and corrective measures must be implemented before proceeding with the test.
              (f) Test for candidate method precision. (1) For each of the measurement sets, for each site, calculate an estimate for the relative precision of the candidate method measurements, CPj, using equation 15 of this section:
              
                ER41AD07.002
              

              (2) For each site, calculate an estimate of candidate method relative precision for the site, CP, using the root mean square calculation of equation 16 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.030
              
              
                Where, J is the total number of valid measurement sets for the site.
              
              
              (3) To pass the test for precision, the mean candidate method relative precision at each site must not be greater than the value for candidate method precision specified in table C-4 of this subpart.
              (g) Test for additive and multiplicative bias (comparative slope and intercept). (1) For each test site, calculate the mean concentration measured by the reference method, R, using equation 17 of this section:
              
                ER41AD07.003
              

              (2) For each test site, calculate the mean concentration measured by the candidate method, C, using equation 18 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.032
              

              (3) For each test site, calculate the linear regression slope and intercept of the mean candidate method measurements (C
                j) against the mean reference method measurements (R
                j), using equations 19 and 20 of this section, respectively:
              
                
                ER17OC06.033
              
              
                ER17OC06.034
              
              (4) To pass this test, at each test site:
              (i) The slope (calculated to at least 2 decimal places) must be in the interval specified for regression slope in table C-4 of this subpart; and
              (ii) The intercept (calculated to at least 2 decimal places) must be in the interval specified for regression intercept in table C-4 of this subpart.
              (iii) The slope and intercept limits are illustrated in figures C-2 and C-3 of this subpart.
              (h) Tests for comparison correlation. (1) For each test site, calculate the (Pearson) correlation coefficient, r (not the coefficient of determination, r2), using equation 21 of this section:
              
                ER41AD07.004
              
              (2) For each test site, calculate the concentration coefficient of variation, CCV, using equation 22 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.036
              
              (3) To pass the test, the correlation coefficient, r, for each test site must not be less than the values, for various values of CCV, specified for correlation in table C-4 of this subpart. These limits are illustrated in figure C-4 of this subpart.

            Subpart D—Procedures for Testing Performance Characteristics of Methods for PM 10
            
            
              Source:
              52 FR 24729, July 1, 1987, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 53.40
              General provisions.

              (a) The test procedures prescribed in this subpart shall be used to test the performance of candidate methods for PM 10 against the performance specifications given in table D-1. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a test sampler or samplers representative of the sampler described in the candidate method must exhibit performance better than, or equal to, the specified value for each performance parameter, to satisfy the requirements of this subpart.
              (b) For a candidate method using a PM 10 sampler previously approved as part of a designated PM 10 method, only the test for precision need be conducted and passed to satisfy the requirements of this subpart. For a candidate method using a PM 10 sampler inlet previously approved as part of a designated PM 10 method, the tests for precision and flow rate stability must be conducted and passed to satisfy the requirements of this subpart; the tests for sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint need not be conducted if suitable rationale is provided to demonstrate that test results submitted for the previously approved method are applicable to the candidate method.

              (c) The liquid particle sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint of a test sampler shall be determined in a wind tunnel using 10 particle sizes and three wind speeds as specified in table D-2. A minimum of 3 replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness shall be required for each of the 30 test conditions for a minimum of 90 test measurements.
              (d) For the liquid particle sampling effectiveness parameter, a smooth curve plot shall be constructed of sampling effectiveness (percent) versus aerodynamic particle diameter (µm) for each of the three wind speeds. These plots shall be used to calculate the expected mass concentration for the test sampler, using the procedure in § 53.43(a). The candidate method passes the liquid particle sampling effectiveness test if the expected mass concentration calculated for the test sampler at each wind speed differs by no more than ±10 percent from that predicted for the “ideal” sampler.*
              
              
                * The sampling effectiveness curve for this “ideal” sampler is described by column 5 of table D-3 and is based on a model that approximates the penetration of particles into the human respiratory tract. Additional information on this model may be found in a document entitled, “Particle Collection Criteria for 10 Micrometer Samplers,” which is available from the Quality Assurance Division (MD-77), Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
              
              (e) For the 50 percent cutpoint parameter, the test result for each wind speed shall be reported as the particle size at which the curve specified in § 53.40(d) crosses the 50 percent effectiveness line. The candidate method passes the 50 percent cutpoint test if the test result at each wind speed falls within 10±0.5 µm.
              (f) The solid particle sampling effectiveness of a test sampler shall be determined in a wind tunnel using 25 µm particles at 2 wind speeds as specified in table D-2. A minimum of three replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness for the 25 µm solid particles shall be required at both wind speeds for a minimum of 6 test measurements.
              (g) For the solid particle sampling effectiveness parameter, the test result for each wind speed shall be reported as the difference between the average of the replicate sampling effectiveness measurements obtained for the 25 µm solid particles and the average of the replicate measurements obtained for the 25 µm liquid particles. The candidate method passes the solid particle sampling effectiveness test if the test result for each wind speed is less than, or equal to, 5 percent.

              (h) The precision and flow rate stability of three identical test samplers shall be determined at a suitable test site by simultaneously sampling the PM 10 concentration of the atmosphere for 10 periods of 24 hours.
              (i) For the precision parameter, the test result for each of the 10 periods of 24 hours shall be calculated using the procedure in § 53.43(c). The candidate method passes the precision test if all of the test results meet the specifications in table D-1.
              (j) For the flow rate stability parameter, the test results for each of the three test samplers and for each of the 10 periods of 24 hours shall be calculated using the procedure in § 53.43(d). The candidate method passes the flow rate stability test if all of the test results meet the specifications in table D-1.
              (k) All test data and other documentation obtained from or pertinent to these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and submitted to EPA.

              (a) Set-up and start-up of all test samplers shall be in strict accordance with the operating instructions specified in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3).
              (b) If the internal surface or surfaces of the candidate method's sampler inlet on which the particles removed by the inlet are collected is a dry surface (i.e., not normally coated with oil or grease), those surfaces shall be cleaned prior to conducting wind tunnel tests with solid particles.
              (c) Once the test sampler or samplers have been set up and the performance tests started, manual adjustment shall be permitted only between test points for the sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint tests or between test days for the precision and flow rate stability tests. The manual adjustments and any periodic maintenance shall be limited to only those procedures prescribed in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). The submitted records shall show clearly when any manual adjustment or periodic maintenance was made and shall describe the operations performed.
              (d) If a test sampler malfunctions during any of the sampling effectiveness and 50 percent cutpoint tests, that test run shall be repeated. If a test sampler malfunctions during any of the precision and flow rate stability tests, that day's test shall be repeated. A detailed explanation of all malfunctions and the remedial actions taken shall be submitted to EPA with the application.
            
            
              § 53.42
              Generation of test atmospheres for wind tunnel tests.
              (a) A vibrating orifice aerosol generator shall be used to produce monodispersed liquid particles of oleic acid tagged with uranine dye and monodispersed solid particles of ammonium fluoroscein with equivalent aerodynamic diameters as specified in table D-2. The geometric standard deviation for each particle size and type generated shall not exceed 1.1 (for primary particles) and the proportion of multiplets (doublets and triplets) in a test particle atmosphere shall not exceed 10 percent. The particle delivery system shall consist of a blower system and a wind tunnel having a test section of sufficiently large cross-sectional area such that the test sampler, or portion thereof, as installed in the test section for testing, blocks no more than 15 percent of that area. To be acceptable, the blower system must be capable of achieving uniform wind speeds at the speeds specified in table D-2.

                s = solid particle.
                Number of liquid particle test points (minimum of 3 replicates for each combination of particle size and wind speed): 90.
                Number of solid particle test points (minimum of 3 replicates for each combination of particle size and wind speed): 6.
                Total number of test points: 96.
              

              (b) The size of the test particles delivered to the test section of the wind tunnel shall be established using the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator and shall be verified during the tests by microscopic examination of samples of the particles collected on glass slides or other suitable substrates. When sizing liquid particles on glass slides, the slides should be pretreated with an oleophobic surfactant and an appropriate flattening factor shall be used in the calculation of aerodynamic diameter. The particle size, as established by the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator, shall be within the tolerance specified in table D-2. The precision of the particle size verification technique shall be 0.5 µm or better, and particle size determined by the verification technique shall not differ by more than 0.5 µm or 10 percent, whichever is higher, from that established by the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator.
              
              (c) The population of multiplets in a test particle atmosphere shall be determined during the tests and shall not exceed 10 percent. Solid particles shall be checked for dryness and evidence of breakage or agglomeration during the microscopic examination. If the solid particles in a test atmosphere are wet or show evidence of significant breakage or agglomeration (µ5 percent), the solid particle test atmosphere is unacceptable for purposes of these tests.
              (d) The concentration of particles in the wind tunnel is not critical. However, the cross-sectional uniformity of the particle concentration in the sampling zone of the test section shall be established during the tests using isokinetic samplers. An array of not less than five evenly spaced isokinetic samplers shall be used to determine the particle concentration uniformity in the sampling zone. If the particle concentration measured by any single isokinetic sampler in the sampling zone differs by more than 10 percent from the mean concentration, the particle delivery system is unacceptable in terms of uniformity of particle concentration. The sampling zone shall be a rectangular area having a horizontal dimension not less than 1.2 times the width of the test sampler at its inlet opening and a vertical dimension not less than 25 centimeters. The sampling zone is an area in the test section of the wind tunnel that is horizontally and vertically symmetrical with respect to the test sampler inlet opening.
              (e) The wind speed in the wind tunnel shall be determined during the tests using an appropriate technique capable of a precision of 5 percent or better (e.g., hot-wire anemometry). The mean wind speed in the test section of the wind tunnel during the tests shall be within 10 percent of the value specified in table D-2. The wind speed measured at any test point in the test section shall not differ by more than 10 percent from the mean wind speed in the test section. The turbulence intensity (longitudinal component and macroscale) in the test section shall be determined during the tests using an appropriate technique (e.g., hot-wire anemometry).
              (f) The accuracy of all flow measurements used to calculate the test atmosphere concentrations and the test results shall be documented to be within ±2 percent, referenced to a primary standard. Any flow measurement corrections shall be clearly shown. All flow measurements shall be given in actual volumetric units.
              (g) Schematic drawings of the particle delivery system (wind tunnel and blower system) and other information showing complete procedural details of the test atmosphere generation, verification, and delivery techniques shall be submitted to EPA. All pertinent calculations shall be clearly presented.
            
            
              § 53.43
              Test procedures.
              (a) Sampling effectiveness—(1) Technical definition. The ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a given size reaching the sampler filter or filters to the mass concentration of particles of the same size approaching the sampler.
              (2) Test procedure. (i) Establish a wind speed specified in table D-2 and measure the wind speed and turbulence intensity (longitudinal component and macroscale) at a minimum of 12 test points in a cross-sectional area of the test section of the wind tunnel. The mean wind speed in the test section must be within ±10 percent of the value specified in table D-2 and the variation at any test point in the test section may not exceed 10 percent of the mean.
              (ii) Generate particles of a size and type specified in table D-2 using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator. Check for the presence of satellites and adjust the generator as necessary. Calculate the aerodynamic particle size using the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator and record. The calculated aerodynamic diameter must be within the tolerance specified in table D-2.

              (iii) Collect a sample of the particles on a glass slide or other suitable substrate at the particle injection point. If a glass slide is used, it should be pretreated with an appropriate oleophobic surfactant when collecting liquid particles. Use a microscopic technique to size a minimum of 25 primary particles in three viewing fields (do not include multiplets). Determine the geometric mean aerodynamic diameter and geometric standard deviation using the bulk density of the particle type (and an appropriate flattening factor for liquid particles if collected on a glass slide). The measured geometric mean aerodynamic diameter must be within 0.5 µm or 10 percent of the aerodynamic diameter calculated from the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator. The geometric standard deviation must not exceed 1.1.
              (iv) Determine the population of multiplets (doublets and triplets) in the collected sample by counting a minimum of 100 particles in three viewing fields. The multiplet population of the particle test atmosphere must not exceed 10 percent.
              (v) Introduce the particles into the wind tunnel and allow the particle concentration to stabilize.
              (vi) Install an array of five or more evenly spaced isokinetic samplers in the sampling zone (see § 53.42(d)) of the wind tunnel. Collect particles on appropriate filters (e.g., glass fiber) over a time period such that the relative error of the measured particle concentration is less than 5 percent. Relative error is defined as (p × 100%)/(X), where p is the precision of the fluorometer on the appropriate range, X is the measured concentration, and the units of p and X are the same.
              (vii) Determine the quantity of material collected with each isokinetic sampler in the array using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration for each isokinetic sampler as:
              
                EC09NO91.015
              
              
                where
                i = replicate number and j = isokinetic sampler number.
              
              
              (viii) Calculate and record the mean mass concentration as:
              
                EC09NO91.016
              
              
                where
                
                n = total number of isokinetic samplers.
              
              
              (ix) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation of the mass concentration measurements as:
              
                EC09NO91.017
              
              If the value of CViso(i) exceeds 0.10, the particle concentration uniformity is unacceptable and steps (vi) through (ix) must be repeated. If adjustment of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator or changes in the particle delivery system are necessary to achieve uniformity, steps (ii) through (ix) must be repeated. Remove the array of isokinetic samplers from the wind tunnel. NOTE: A single isokinetic sampler, operated at the same nominal flow rate as the test sampler, may be used in place of the array of isokinetic samplers for the determination of particle mass concentration used in the calculation of sampling effectiveness of the test sampler in step (xiii). In this case, the array of isokinetic samplers must be used to demonstrate particle concentration uniformity prior to the replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.

              (x) If a single isokinetic sampler is used, install the sampler in the wind tunnel with the sampler nozzle centered in the sampling zone (see § 53.42(d)). Collect particles on an appropriate filter (e.g., glass fiber) for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration (as defined in step (vi)) is less than 5 percent. Determine the quantity of material collected with the isokinetic sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration as Ciso(i) as in step vii. Remove the isokinetic sampler from the wind tunnel.
              (xi) Install the test sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind tunnel with the sampler inlet opening centered in the sampling zone (see § 53.42(d)). To meet the maximum blockage limit of § 53.42(a) or for convenience, part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles on an appropriate filter or filters (e.g., glass fiber) for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration (as defined in step (vi)) is less than 5 percent.
              (xii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the test sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration as:
              
                EC09NO91.018
              
              
                where i = replicate number.
              
              
              (xiii) Calculate and record the sampling effectiveness of the test sampler as:
              
                EC09NO91.019
              
              
                where i = replicate number.
              
              
              
                Note:

                If a single isokinetic sampler is used for the determination of particle mass concentration, replace Ciso(i) with Ciso(i).
              
              
              (xiv) Remove the test sampler from the wind tunnel. Repeat steps (vi) through (xiii), as appropriate, to obtain a minimum of three replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.
              (xv) Calculate and record the average sampling effectiveness of the test sampler as:
              
                EC09NO91.020
              
              
                where n = number of replicates.
              
              (xvi) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation for the replicate sampling effectiveness measurements of the test sampler as:
              
                EC09NO91.021
              
              If the value of CVE exceeds 0.10, the test run (steps (ii) through (xvi)) must be repeated.
              (xvii) Repeat steps i through xvi for each wind speed, particle size, and particle type specified in table D-2.
              (xviii) For each of the three wind speeds (nominally 2, 8, and 24 km/hr), correct the liquid particle sampling effectiveness data for the presence of multiplets (doublets and triplets) in the test particle atmospheres.

              (xix) For each wind speed, plot the corrected liquid particle sampling effectiveness of the test sampler (Ecorr) as a function of particle size (dp) on semi-logarithmic graph paper where dp is the particle size established by the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator. Construct a smooth curve through the data.
              
              (xx) For each wind speed, calculate the expected mass concentration for the test sampler under the assumed particle size distribution and compare it to the mass concentration predicted for the ideal sampler, as follows:

              (A) Extrapolate the upper and lower ends of the corrected liquid particle sampling effectiveness curve to 100 percent and 0 percent, respectively, using smooth curves. Assume that Ecorr = 100 percent at a particle size of 1.0 µm and Ecorr = 0 percent at a particle size of 50 µm.
              (B) Determine the value of Ecorr at each of the particle sizes specified in the first column of table D-3. Record each Ecorr value as a decimal between 0 and 1 in the second column of table D-3.
              (C) Multiply the values of Ecorr in column 2 by the interval mass concentration values in column 3 and enter the products in column 4 of table D-3.
              (D) Sum the values in column 4 and enter the total as the expected mass concentration for the test sampler at the bottom of column 4 of table D-3.
              (E) Calculate and record the percent difference in expected mass concentration between the test sampler and the ideal sampler as:
              
                EC09NO91.022
              
              
                where:
                
                Csam(exp) = expected mass concentration for the test sampler, µg/m3
                
                Cideal(exp) = expected mass concentration for the ideal sampler, µg/m3 (calculated for the ideal sampler and given at the bottom of column 7 of table D-3.)
              
              
              (F) The candidate method passes the liquid particle sampling effectiveness test if the Δ C value for each wind speed meets the specification in table D-1.
              (xxi) For each of the two wind speeds (nominally 8 and 24 km/hr), calculate the difference between the average sampling effectiveness value for the 25 µm solid particles and the average sampling effectiveness value for the 25 µm liquid particles (uncorrected for multiplets).
              (xxii) The candidate method passes the solid particle sampling effectiveness test if each such difference meets the specification in table D-1.

              (b) 50 Percent cutpoint—(1) Technical definition. The particle size for which the sampling effectiveness of the sampler is 50 percent.
              (2) Test procedure. (i) From the corrected liquid particle sampling effectiveness curves for each of the three wind speeds, determine the particle size at which the curve crosses the 50 percent effectiveness line and record as D50 on the corresponding sampling effectiveness plot.

              (ii) The candidate method passes the 50 percent cutpoint test if the D50 value at each wind speed meets the specification in table D-1.
              (c) Precision—(1) Technical definition. The variation in the measured particle concentration among identical samplers under typical sampling conditions.
              (2) Test procedure. (i) Set up three identical test samplers at the test site in strict accordance with the instructions in the manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). Locate the test sampler inlet openings at the same height and between 2 and 4 meters apart. The samplers shall be oriented in a manner that will minimize spatial and wind directional effects on sample collection. Perform a flow calibration for each test sampler in accordance with the instructions given in the instruction manual and/or appendix J to part 50 of this chapter. Set the operating flow rate to the value prescribed in the sampler instruction manual.
              
              
                Note:
                For candidate equivalent methods, this test may be used to satisfy part of the requirements of subpart C of this chapter. In that case, three reference method samplers are also used at the test site, measurements with the candidate and reference methods are compared as specified in § 53.34, and the test site must meet the requirements of § 53.30(b).
              
              
              (ii) Measure the PM 10 concentration of the atmosphere using the three test samplers for 10 periods (test days) of 24 hours each. On each of the 10 test days, measure the initial and final flow rates of each test sampler. On three of the test days, measure the flow rate of each test sampler after 6, 12, and 18 hours of operation. All measurements of flow rate and mass collected must be made in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the sampler instruction manual and/or appendix J to part 50 of this chapter. All measurements of flow rate must be in actual volumetric units. Record the PM 10 concentration for each sampler and each test day as C(i)(j) where i is the sampler number and j is the test day.

              (iii) For each test day, calculate and record the average of the three measured PM 10 concentrations as C(j) where j is the test day. If C(j)<30 µg/m3 for any test day, data from that test day are unacceptable and the tests for that day must be repeated.
              (iv) Calculate and record the precision for each of the 10 test days as:
              
                
                53-48.eps
              

              (v) The candidate method passes the precision test if all 10 Pj or RPj values meet the specifications in table D-1.
              (d) Flow rate stability—(1) Technical definition. Freedom from variation in the operating flow rate of the sampler under typical sampling conditions.
              (2) Test procedure. (i) For each of the three test samplers and each of the 10 test days of the precision test, record each measured flow rate as F(i)(j)(t), where i is the sampler number, j is the test day, and t is the time of flow rate measurement (t = 0, 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours).
              (ii) For each sampler and for each test day, calculate and record the average flow rate as:
              
                53-49a.eps
              
              
                where n = number of flow rate measurements during the 24-hour test day.
              
              
              (iii) For each sampler and for each test day, calculate and record the percent difference between the average flow rate and the initial flow rate as:
              
                53-49b.eps
              
              
                where F(i)(j)(0) is the initial flow rate (t = 0).
              
              
              (iv) For each sampler and for each of the 3 test days on which flow measurements were obtained at 6-hour intervals throughout the 24-hour sampling period, calculate and record the percent differences between each measured flow rate and the initial flow rate as:

              § 53.50
              General provisions.
              (a) A candidate method for PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 described in an application for a FRM or FEM determination submitted under § 53.4 shall be determined by the EPA to be a FRM or a Class I, II, or III FEM on the basis of the definitions for such methods given in § 53.1. This subpart sets forth the specific tests that must be carried out and the test results, evidence, documentation, and other materials that must be provided to EPA to demonstrate that a PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 sampler associated with a candidate reference method or Class I or Class II equivalent method meets all design and performance specifications set forth in appendix L or O, respectively, of part 50 of this chapter as well as additional requirements specified in this subpart E. Some or all of these tests may also be applicable to a candidate Class III equivalent method or analyzer, as may be determined under § 53.3(b)(3).
              (b) PM
                2.5
                methods—(1) Reference method. A sampler associated with a candidate reference method for PM 2.5 shall be subject to the provisions, specifications, and test procedures prescribed in §§ 53.51 through 53.58.

              (c) PM
                10-2.5
                methods—(1) Reference method. A sampler associated with a reference method for PM 10-2.5, as specified in appendix O to part 50 of this chapter, shall be subject to the requirements in this paragraph (c)(1).
              (i) The PM 2.5 sampler of the PM 10-2.5 sampler pair shall be verified to be either currently designated under this part 53 as a FRM for PM 2.5, or shown to meet all requirements for designation as a FRM for PM 2.5, in accordance with this part 53.
              (ii) The PM 10C sampler of the PM 10-2.5 sampler pair shall be verified to be of like manufacturer, design, configuration, and fabrication to the PM 2.5 sampler of the PM 10-2.5 sampler pair, except for replacement of the particle size separator specified in section 7.3.4 of appendix L to part 50 of this chapter with the downtube extension as specified in Figure O-1 of appendix O to part 50 of this chapter.

              (iii) For samplers that meet the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the candidate PM 10-2.5 reference method may be determined to be a FRM without further testing.
              (2) Class I method. A sampler associated with a Class I candidate equivalent method for PM 10-2.5 shall meet the requirements in this paragraph (c)(2).
              (i) The PM 2.5 sampler of the PM 10-2.5 sampler pair shall be verified to be either currently designated under this part 53 as a FRM or Class I FEM for PM 2.5, or shown to meet all requirements for designation as a FRM or Class I FEM for PM 2.5, in accordance with this part 53.
              (ii) The PM 10c sampler of the PM 10-2.5 sampler pair shall be verified to be of similar design to the PM 10-2.5 sampler and to meet all requirements for designation as a FRM or Class I FRM for PM 2.5, in accordance with this part 53, except for replacement of the particle size separator specified in section 7.3.4 of appendix L to part 50 of this chapter with the downtube extension as specified in Figure O-1 of appendix O to part 50 of this chapter.

              (iii) For samplers that meet the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the candidate PM 10-2.5 method may be determined to be a Class I FEM without further testing.
              (3) Class II method. A sampler associated with a Class II candidate equivalent method for PM 10-2.5 shall be subject to the applicable requirements of this subpart E, as described in § 53.3(a)(5).

              (d) The provisions of § 53.51 pertain to test results and documentation required to demonstrate compliance of a candidate method sampler with the design specifications set forth in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or O, as applicable. The test procedures prescribed in §§ 53.52 through 53.59 pertain to performance tests required to demonstrate compliance of a candidate method sampler with the performance specifications set forth in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or O, as applicable, as well as additional requirements specified in this subpart E. These latter test procedures shall be used to test the performance of candidate samplers against the performance specifications and requirements specified in each procedure and summarized in table E-1 of this subpart.

              (e) Test procedures prescribed in § 53.59 do not apply to candidate reference method samplers. These procedures apply primarily to candidate Class I or Class II equivalent method samplers for PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 that have a sample air flow path configuration upstream of the sample filter that is modified from that specified for the FRM sampler, as set forth in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, Figures L-1 to L-29 or 40 CFR part 50 appendix O, Figure O-1, if applicable, such as might be necessary to provide for sequential sample capability. The additional tests determine the adequacy of aerosol transport through any altered components or supplemental devices that are used in a candidate sampler upstream of the filter. In addition to the other test procedures in this subpart, these test procedures shall be used to further test the performance of such an equivalent method sampler against the performance specifications given in the procedure and summarized in table E-1 of this subpart.

              (f) A 10-day operational field test of measurement precision is required under § 53.58 for both FRM and Class I FEM samplers for PM 2.5. This test requires collocated operation of three candidate method samplers at a field test site. For candidate FEM samplers, this test may be combined and carried out concurrently with the test for comparability to the FRM specified under § 53.34, which requires collocated operation of three FRM samplers and three candidate FEM samplers.
              (g) All tests and collection of test data shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of reference 1, section 4.10.5 (ISO 9001) and reference 2, part B, (section 6) and Part C, (section 7) in appendix A of this subpart. All test data and other documentation obtained specifically from or pertinent to these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and submitted to EPA in accordance with subpart A of this part.

              § 53.51
              Demonstration of compliance with design specifications and manufacturing and test requirements.
              (a) Overview. (1) Paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section specify certain documentation that must be submitted and tests that are required to demonstrate that samplers associated with a designated FRM or FEM for PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 are properly manufactured to meet all applicable design and performance specifications and have been properly tested according to all applicable test requirements for such designation. Documentation is required to show that instruments and components of a PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 sampler are manufactured in an ISO 9001-registered facility under a quality system that meets ISO-9001 requirements for manufacturing quality control and testing.
              (2) In addition, specific tests are required by paragraph (d) of this section to verify that critical features of FRM samplers—the particle size separator and the surface finish of surfaces specified to be anodized—meet the specifications of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or appendix O, as applicable. A checklist is required to provide certification by an ISO-certified auditor that all performance and other required tests have been properly and appropriately conducted, based on a reasonable and appropriate sample of the actual operations or their documented records. Following designation of the method, another checklist is required initially to provide an ISO-certified auditor's certification that the sampler manufacturing process is being implemented under an adequate and appropriate quality system.

              (3) For the purposes of this section, the definitions of ISO 9001-registered facility and ISO-certified auditor are found in § 53.1. An exception to the reliance by EPA on ISO-certified auditors is the requirement for the submission of the operation or instruction manual associated with the candidate method to EPA as part of the application. This manual is required under § 53.4(b)(3). The EPA has determined that acceptable technical judgment for review of this manual may not be assured by ISO-certified auditors, and approval of this manual will therefore be performed by EPA.
              
              (b) ISO registration of manufacturing facility. The applicant must submit documentation verifying that the samplers identified and sold as part of a designated PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 FRM or FEM will be manufactured in an ISO 9001-registered facility and that the manufacturing facility is maintained in compliance with all applicable ISO 9001 requirements (reference 1 in appendix A of this subpart). The documentation shall indicate the date of the original ISO 9001 registration for the facility and shall include a copy of the most recent certification of continued ISO 9001 facility registration. If the manufacturer does not wish to initiate or complete ISO 9001 registration for the manufacturing facility, documentation must be included in the application to EPA describing an alternative method to demonstrate that the facility meets the same general requirements as required for registration to ISO-9001. In this case, the applicant must provide documentation in the application to demonstrate, by required ISO-certified auditor's inspections, that a quality system is in place which is adequate to document and monitor that the sampler system components and final assembled samplers all conform to the design, performance and other requirements specified in this part and in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.
              (c) Sampler manufacturing quality control. The manufacturer must ensure that all components used in the manufacture of PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 samplers to be sold as part of a FRM or FEM and that are specified by design in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or O (as applicable), are fabricated or manufactured exactly as specified. If the manufacturer's quality records show that its quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) system of standard process control inspections (of a set number and frequency of testing that is less than 100 percent) complies with the applicable QA provisions of section 4 of reference 4 in appendix A of this subpart and prevents nonconformances, 100 percent testing shall not be required until that conclusion is disproved by customer return or other independent manufacturer or customer test records. If problems are uncovered, inspection to verify conformance to the drawings, specifications, and tolerances shall be performed. Refer also to paragraph (e) of this section—final assembly and inspection requirements.
              (d) Specific tests and supporting documentation required to verify conformance to critical component specifications—(1) Verification of PM
                2.5
                (WINS) impactor jet diameter. For samplers utilizing the WINS impactor particle size separator specified in paragraphs 7.3.4.1, 7.3.4.2, and 7.3.4.3 of appendix L to part 50 of this chapter, the diameter of the jet of each impactor manufactured for a PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 sampler under the impactor design specifications set forth in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, shall be verified against the tolerance specified on the drawing, using standard, NIST-traceable ZZ go/no go plug gages. This test shall be a final check of the jet diameter following all fabrication operations, and a record shall be kept of this final check. The manufacturer shall submit evidence that this procedure is incorporated into the manufacturing procedure, that the test is or will be routinely implemented, and that an appropriate procedure is in place for the disposition of units that fail this tolerance test.
              (2) VSCC separator. For samplers utilizing the BGI VSCC TM Very Sharp Cut Cyclone particle size separator specified in paragraph 7.3.4.4 of appendix L to part 50 of this chapter, the VSCC manufacturer shall identify the critical dimensions and manufacturing tolerances for the device, develop appropriate test procedures to verify that the critical dimensions and tolerances are maintained during the manufacturing process, and carry out those procedures on each VSCC manufactured to verify conformance of the manufactured products. The manufacturer shall also maintain records of these tests and their results and submit evidence that this procedure is incorporated into the manufacturing procedure, that the test is or will be routinely implemented, and that an appropriate procedure is in place for the disposition of units that fail this tolerance test.
              (3) Verification of surface finish. The anodization process used to treat surfaces specified to be anodized shall be verified by testing treated specimen surfaces for weight and corrosion resistance to ensure that the coating obtained conforms to the coating specification. The specimen surfaces shall be finished in accordance with military standard specification 8625F, Type II, Class I (reference 4 in appendix A of this subpart) in the same way the sampler surfaces are finished, and tested, prior to sealing, as specified in section 4.5.2 of reference 4 in appendix A of this subpart.
              (e) Final assembly and inspection requirements. Each sampler shall be tested after manufacture and before delivery to the final user. Each manufacturer shall document its post-manufacturing test procedures. As a minimum, each test shall consist of the following: Tests of the overall integrity of the sampler, including leak tests; calibration or verification of the calibration of the flow measurement device, barometric pressure sensor, and temperature sensors; and operation of the sampler with a filter in place over a period of at least 48 hours. The results of each test shall be suitably documented and shall be subject to review by an ISO-certified auditor.
              (f) Manufacturer's audit checklists. Manufacturers shall require an ISO-certified auditor to sign and date a statement indicating that the auditor is aware of the appropriate manufacturing specifications contained in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or O (as applicable), and the test or verification requirements in this subpart. Manufacturers shall also require an ISO-certified auditor to complete the checklists, shown in figures E-1 and E-2 of this subpart, which describe the manufacturer's ability to meet the requirements of the standard for both designation testing and product manufacture.
              (1) Designation testing checklist. The completed statement and checklist as shown in figure E-1 of this subpart shall be submitted with the application for FRM or FEM determination.
              (2) Product manufacturing checklist. Manufacturers shall require an ISO-certified auditor to complete a Product Manufacturing Checklist (figure E-2 of this subpart), which evaluates the manufacturer on its ability to meet the requirements of the standard in maintaining quality control in the production of FRM or FEM devices. The completed checklist shall be submitted with the application for FRM or FEM determination.

              § 53.52
              Leak check test.
              (a) Overview. In section 7.4.6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, the sampler is required to include the facility, including components, instruments, operator controls, a written procedure, and other capabilities as necessary, to allow the operator to carry out a leak test of the sampler at a field monitoring site without additional equipment. This test procedure is intended to test the adequacy and effectiveness of the sampler's leak check facility. Because of the variety of potential sampler configurations and leak check procedures possible, some adaptation of this procedure may be necessary to accommodate the specific sampler under test. The test conditions and performance specifications associated with this test are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. The candidate test sampler must meet all test parameters and test specifications to successfully pass this test.
              (b) Technical definitions. (1) External leakage includes the total flow rate of external ambient air which enters the sampler other than through the sampler inlet and which passes through any one or more of the impactor, filter, or flow rate measurement components.
              (2) Internal leakage is the total sample air flow rate that passes through the filter holder assembly without passing through the sample filter.
              (c) Required test equipment. (1) Flow rate measurement device, range 70 mL/min to 130 mL/min, 2 percent certified accuracy, NIST-traceable.
              (2) Flow rate measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler flow rate at the top of the downtube.
              (3) Impermeable membrane or disk, 47 mm nominal diameter.

              (4) Means, such as a micro-valve, of providing a simulated leak flow rate through the sampler of approximately 80 mL/min under the conditions specified for the leak check in the sampler's leak check procedure.
              
              (5) Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.
              (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at zero and one or more non-zero flow rates within 7 days of use for this test.
              (e) Test setup. (1) The test sampler shall be set up for testing as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in its normal configuration for collecting PM samples, except that the sample air inlet shall be removed and the flow rate measurement adaptor shall be installed on the sampler's downtube.
              (2) The flow rate control device shall be set up to provide a constant, controlled flow rate of 80 mL/min into the sampler downtube under the conditions specified for the leak check in the sampler's leak check procedure.
              (3) The flow rate measurement device shall be set up to measure the controlled flow rate of 80 mL/min into the sampler downtube under the conditions specified for the leak check in the sampler's leak check procedure.
              (f) Procedure. (1) Install the impermeable membrane in a filter cassette and install the cassette into the sampler. Carry out the internal leak check procedure as described in the sampler's operation/instruction manual and verify that the leak check acceptance criterion specified in table E-1 of this subpart is met.
              (2) Replace the impermeable membrane with a Teflon filter and install the cassette in the sampler. Remove the inlet from the sampler and install the flow measurement adaptor on the sampler's downtube. Close the valve of the adaptor to seal the flow system. Conduct the external leak check procedure as described in the sampler's operation/instruction manual and verify that the leak check acceptance criteria specified in table E-1 of this subpart are met.
              (3) Arrange the flow control device, flow rate measurement device, and other apparatus as necessary to provide a simulated leak flow rate of 80 mL/min into the test sampler through the downtube during the specified external leak check procedure. Carry out the external leak check procedure as described in the sampler's operation/instruction manual but with the simulated leak of 80 mL/min.
              (g) Test results. The requirements for successful passage of this test are:
              (1) That the leak check procedure indicates no significant external or internal leaks in the test sampler when no simulated leaks are introduced.
              (2) That the leak check procedure properly identifies the occurrence of the simulated external leak of 80 mL/min.

              § 53.53
              Test for flow rate accuracy, regulation, measurement accuracy, and cut-off.
              (a) Overview. This test procedure is designed to evaluate a candidate sampler's flow rate accuracy with respect to the design flow rate, flow rate regulation, flow rate measurement accuracy, coefficient of variability measurement accuracy, and the flow rate cut-off function. The tests for the first four parameters shall be conducted over a 6-hour time period during which reference flow measurements are made at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. The flow rate cut-off test, conducted separately, is intended to verify that the sampler carries out the required automatic sample flow rate cut-off function properly in the event of a low-flow condition. The test conditions and performance specifications associated with this test are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. The candidate test sampler must meet all test parameters and test specifications to successfully pass this test.
              (b) Technical definitions. (1) Sample flow rate means the quantitative volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the sampler to enter the sampler inlet and pass through the sample filter, measured in actual volume units at the temperature and pressure of the air as it enters the inlet.
              (2) The flow rate cut-off function requires the sampler to automatically stop sample flow and terminate the current sample collection if the sample flow rate deviates by more than the variation limits specified in table E-1 of this subpart (±10 percent from the nominal sample flow rate) for more than 60 seconds during a sample collection period. The sampler is also required to properly notify the operator with a flag warning indication of the out-of-specification flow rate condition and if the flow rate cut-off results in an elapsed sample collection time of less than 23 hours.
              (c) Required test equipment. (1) Flow rate meter, suitable for measuring and recording the actual volumetric sample flow rate at the sampler downtube, with a minimum range of 10 to 25 L/min, 2 percent certified, NIST-traceable accuracy. Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 30 seconds is recommended. While a flow meter which provides a direct indication of volumetric flow rate is preferred for this test, an alternative certified flow measurement device may be used as long as appropriate volumetric flow rate corrections are made based on measurements of actual ambient temperature and pressure conditions.
              (2) Ambient air temperature sensor, with a resolution of 0.1 °C and certified to be accurate to within 0.5 °C (if needed). If the certified flow meter does not provide direct volumetric flow rate readings, ambient air temperature measurements must be made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
              (3) Barometer, range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2 mm Hg (if needed). If the certified flow meter does not provide direct volumetric flow rate readings, ambient pressure measurements must be made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
              (4) Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sample flow rate at the sampler downtube.
              (5) Valve or other means to restrict or reduce the sample flow rate to a value at least 10 percent below the design flow rate (16.67 L/min). If appropriate, the valve of the flow measurement adaptor may be used for this purpose.
              (6) Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter, such as an orifice or flow restrictive plate installed in the filter holder or a valve or other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the flow path near the filter.
              (7) Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L (if required).
              (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy of flow-rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at zero and at least one flow rate within ±3 percent of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an instrument's measurements are to be recorded with an analog recording device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.
              (e) Test setup. (1) Setup of the sampler shall be as required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in its normal configuration for collecting PM samples. A sample filter and (or) the device for creating an additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall be installed for the duration of these tests. The sampler's ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and flow rate measurement systems shall all be calibrated per the sampler's operation or instruction manual within 7 days prior to this test.
              
              (2) The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow measurement adaptor installed on the sampler's downtube. A leak check as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried out.
              (3) The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to the outlet of the flow rate meter.
              (4) For the flow rate cut-off test, the valve or means for reducing sampler flow rate shall be installed between the flow measurement adaptor and the downtube or in another location within the sampler such that the sampler flow rate can be manually restricted during the test.
              (f) Procedure. (1) Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e) of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or instruction manual. Set the sampler to automatically start a 6-hour sample collection period at a convenient time.
              (2) During the 6-hour operational flow rate portion of the test, measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, ambient temperature and pressure shall be measured at the same frequency as that of the certified flow rate measurements. Note and record the actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test period.
              (3) Following completion of the 6-hour flow rate test period, install the flow rate reduction device and change the sampler flow rate recording frequency to intervals of not more than 30 seconds. Reset the sampler to start a new sample collection period. Manually restrict the sampler flow rate such that the sampler flow rate is decreased slowly over several minutes to a flow rate slightly less than the flow rate cut-off value (15.0 L/min). Maintain this flow rate for at least 2.0 minutes or until the sampler stops the sample flow automatically. Manually terminate the sample period, if the sampler has not terminated it automatically.
              (g) Test results. At the completion of the test, validate the test conditions and determine the test results as follows:
              (1) Mean sample flow rate. (i) From the certified measurements (Qref) of the test sampler flow rate obtained by use of the flow rate meter, tabulate each flow rate measurement in units of L/min. If ambient temperature and pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, each measured flow rate shall be corrected using its corresponding temperature and pressure measurement values. Calculate the mean flow rate for the sample period (Qref,ave) as follows:

Set the sampler to automatically start a 6-hour sample collection period at a convenient time.
              (2) During the entire 6-hour operational flow rate portion of the test, measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. If ambient temperature and pressure corrections are necessary to calculate volumetric flow rate, ambient temperature and pressure shall be measured at the same frequency as that of the certified flow rate measurements. Note and record the actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test period.

              § 53.55
              Test for effect of variations in power line voltage and ambient temperature.
              (a) Overview. (1) This test procedure is a combined procedure to test various performance parameters under variations in power line voltage and ambient temperature. Tests shall be conducted in a temperature-controlled environment over four 6-hour time periods during which reference temperature and flow rate measurements shall be made at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.

Each performance parameter tested, as described or determined in the test procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance specification given. The candidate sampler must meet all specifications for the associated PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 method (as applicable) to pass this test procedure.
              (b) Technical definition.

              § 53.56
              Test for effect of variations in ambient pressure.
              (a) Overview. (1) This test procedure is designed to test various sampler performance parameters under variations in ambient (barometric) pressure. Tests shall be conducted in a pressure-controlled environment over two 6-hour time periods during which reference pressure and flow rate measurements shall be made at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. Specific parameters to be evaluated at operating pressures of 600 and 800 mm Hg are as follows:
              (i) Sample flow rate.
              (ii) Flow rate regulation.
              (iii) Flow rate measurement accuracy.
              (iv) Coefficient of variability measurement accuracy.
              (v) Ambient pressure measurement accuracy.
              (vi) Proper operation of the sampler when exposed to ambient pressure extremes.

              (2) The performance parameters tested under this procedure, the corresponding minimum performance specifications, and the applicable test conditions are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. Each performance parameter tested, as described or determined in the test procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance specification given. The candidate sampler must meet all specifications for the associated PM 2.5 or PM 10-2.5 method (as applicable) to pass this test procedure.
              (b) Technical definition. Sample flow rate means the quantitative volumetric flow rate of the air stream caused by the sampler to enter the sampler inlet and pass through the sample filter, measured in actual volume units at the temperature and pressure of the air as it enters the inlet.
              (c) Required test equipment. (1) Hypobaric chamber or other pressure-controlled environment or environments, capable of obtaining and maintaining pressures at 600 mm Hg and 800 mm Hg required for the test with an accuracy of 5 mm Hg. Henceforth, where the test procedures specify a test or environmental chamber, an alternative pressure-controlled environmental area or areas may be substituted, provided the test pressure requirements are met. Means for simulating ambient pressure using a closed-loop sample air system may also be approved for this test; such a proposed method for simulating the test pressure conditions may be described and submitted to EPA at the address given in § 53.4(a) prior to conducting the test for a specific individual determination of acceptability.
              (2) Flow rate meter, suitable for measuring and recording the actual volumetric sampler flow rate at the sampler downtube, with a minimum range of 10 to 25 L/min, 2 percent certified, NIST-traceable accuracy. Optional capability for continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes is recommended. While a flow meter which provides a direct indication of volumetric flow rate is preferred for this test, an alternative certified flow measurement device may be used as long as appropriate volumetric flow rate corrections are made based on measurements of actual ambient temperature and pressure conditions.

              (3) Ambient air temperature recorder (if needed for volumetric corrections to flow rate measurements) with a range −30 °C to = 50 °C, certified accurate to within 0.5 °C. If the certified flow meter does not provide direct volumetric flow rate readings, ambient temperature measurements must be made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
              
              (4) Barometer, range 600 mm Hg to 800 mm Hg, certified accurate to 2 mm Hg. Ambient air pressure measurements must be made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
              (5) Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler flow rate at the sampler downtube.
              (6) Means for creating an additional pressure drop of 55 mm Hg in the sampler to simulate a heavily loaded filter, such as an orifice or flow restrictive plate installed in the filter holder or a valve or other flow restrictor temporarily installed in the flow path near the filter.
              (7) Teflon sample filter, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L (if required).
              (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at zero and at least one flow rate within ±3 percent of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an instrument's measurements are to be recorded with an analog recording device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.
              (e) Test setup. (1) Setup of the sampler shall be performed as required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3).

A sample filter and (or) the device for creating an additional 55 mm Hg pressure drop shall be installed for the duration of these tests. The sampler's ambient temperature, ambient pressure, and flow measurement systems shall all be calibrated per the sampler's operating manual within 7 days prior to this test.
              (2) The inlet of the candidate sampler shall be removed and the flow measurement adaptor installed on the sampler's downtube. A leak check as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual shall be conducted and must be properly passed before other tests are carried out.
              (3) The inlet of the flow measurement adaptor shall be connected to the outlet of the flow rate meter.
              (4) The barometer shall be installed in the test chamber such that it will accurately measure the air pressure to which the candidate sampler is subjected.
              (f) Procedure. (1) Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e) of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or instruction manual.
              (2) The test shall consist of two test runs, one at each of the following conditions of chamber pressure:
              (i) 600 mm Hg.
              (ii) 800 mm Hg.
              (3) For each of the two test runs, set the selected chamber pressure for the test run. Upon achieving each pressure setpoint in the chamber, the candidate sampler shall be pressure-equilibrated for a period of at least 30 minutes prior to the test run. Following the conditioning time, set the sampler to automatically start a 6-hour sample collection period at a convenient time.
              (4) During each 6-hour test period:
              (i) Measure and record the sample flow rate with the flow rate meter at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.

Note and record the actual start and stop times for the 6-hour flow rate test period.

              (ii) Determine and record the ambient (chamber) pressure indicated by the sampler and the corresponding ambient (chamber) pressure measured by the barometer specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
              
              (5) At the end of each test period, terminate the sample period (if not automatically terminated by the sampler) and download all archived instrument data for the test run from the test sampler.
              (g) Test results. For each of the two test runs, examine the chamber pressure measurements. Verify that the pressure met the requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section at all times during the test. If not, the test run is not valid and must be repeated.

              § 53.57
              Test for filter temperature control during sampling and post-sampling periods.
              (a) Overview. This test is intended to measure the candidate sampler's ability to prevent excessive overheating of the PM sample collection filter (or filters) under conditions of elevated solar insolation. The test evaluates radiative effects on filter temperature during a 4-hour period of active sampling as well as during a subsequent 4-hour non-sampling time period prior to filter retrieval. Tests shall be conducted in an environmental chamber which provides the proper radiant wavelengths and energies to adequately simulate the sun's radiant effects under clear conditions at sea level. For additional guidance on conducting solar radiative tests under controlled conditions, consult military standard specification 810-E (reference 6 in appendix A of this subpart). The performance parameters tested under this procedure, the corresponding minimum performance specifications, and the applicable test conditions are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart. Each performance parameter tested, as described or determined in the test procedure, must meet or exceed the associated performance specification to successfully pass this test.
              (b) Technical definition. Filter temperature control during sampling is the ability of a sampler to maintain the temperature of the particulate matter sample filter within the specified deviation (5 °C) from ambient temperature during any active sampling period. Post-sampling temperature control is the ability of a sampler to maintain the temperature of the particulate matter sample filter within the specified deviation from ambient temperature during the period from the end of active sample collection by the sampler until the filter is retrieved from the sampler for laboratory analysis.
              (c) Required test equipment. (1) Environmental chamber providing the means, such as a bank of solar-spectrum lamps, for generating or simulating thermal radiation in approximate spectral content and intensity equivalent to solar insulation of 1000 ±50 W/m2 inside the environmental chamber. To properly simulate the sun's radiative effects on the sampler, the solar bank must provide the spectral energy distribution and permitted tolerances specified in table E-2 of this subpart. The solar radiation source area shall be such that the width of the candidate sampler shall not exceed one-half the dimensions of the solar bank. The solar bank shall be located a minimum of 76 cm (30 inches) from any surface of the candidate sampler. To meet requirements of the solar radiation tests, the chamber's internal volume shall be a minimum of 10 times that of the volume of the candidate sampler. Air velocity in the region of the sampler must be maintained continuously during the radiative tests at 2.0 ±0.5 m/sec.
              (2) Ambient air temperature recorder, range −30 °C to = 50 °C, with a resolution of 0.1 °C and certified accurate to within 0.5 °C. Ambient air temperature measurements must be made using continuous (analog) recording capability or digital recording at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes.
              (3) Flow measurement adaptor (40 CFR part 50, appendix L, figure L-30) or equivalent adaptor to facilitate measurement of sampler flow rate at the sampler downtube.

              (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at zero and at least one flow rate within ±3 percent of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an instrument's measurements are to be recorded with an analog recording device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.

(1) Setup of the sampler shall be performed as required in this paragraph (e) and otherwise as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3). The sampler shall be installed upright and set up in the solar radiation environmental chamber in its normal configuration for collecting PM samples (with the inlet installed). The sampler's ambient and filter temperature measurement systems shall be calibrated per the sampler's operating manual within 7 days prior to this test.

              (2) The miniature temperature sensor shall be temporarily installed in the test sampler such that it accurately measures the air temperature 1 cm from the center of the filter on the downstream side of the filter. The sensor shall be installed such that no external or internal air leakage is created by the sensor installation.

For sequential samplers, similar temperature sensors shall also be temporarily installed in the test sampler to monitor the temperature 1 cm from the center of each filter stored in the sampler for sequential sample operation.
              (3) The solar radiant energy source shall be installed in the test chamber such that the entire test sampler is irradiated in a manner similar to the way it would be irradiated by solar radiation if it were located outdoors in an open area on a sunny day, with the radiation arriving at an angle of between 30° and 45° from vertical. The intensity of the radiation received by all sampler surfaces that receive direct radiation shall average 1000 ±50 W/m2, measured in a plane perpendicular to the incident radiation. The incident radiation shall be oriented with respect to the sampler such that the area of the sampler's ambient temperature sensor (or temperature shield) receives full, direct radiation as it would or could during normal outdoor installation. Also, the temperature sensor must not be shielded or shaded from the radiation by a sampler part in a way that would not occur at other normal insulation angles or directions.

The solar radiometer shall be oriented so that it measures the radiation in a plane perpendicular to its angle of incidence.

              (5) The ambient air temperature recorder shall be installed in the test chamber such that it will accurately measure the temperature of the air in the chamber without being unduly affected by the chamber's air temperature control system or by the radiant energy from the solar radiation source that may be present inside the test chamber.
              (f) Procedure. (1) Set up the sampler as specified in paragraph (e) of this section and otherwise prepare the sampler for normal sample collection operation as directed in the sampler's operation or instruction manual.
              (2) Remove the inlet of the candidate test sampler and install the flow measurement adaptor on the sampler's downtube. Conduct a leak check as described in the sampler's operation or instruction manual. The leak test must be properly passed before other tests are carried out.

              (6) At the completion of the 4-hour sampling phase, terminate the sample period, if not terminated automatically by the sampler. Continue to measure and record the radiant flux, ambient temperature, and filter temperature or temperatures for 4 additional hours at intervals not to exceed 5 minutes. At the completion of the 4-hour post-sampling period, discontinue the measurements and turn off the solar source.
              (7) Download all archived sampler data from the test run.
              (g) Test results. Chamber radiant flux control. Examine the continuous record of the chamber radiant flux and verify that the flux met the requirements specified in table E-2 of this subpart at all times during the test. If not, the entire test is not valid and must be repeated.

              § 53.58
              Operational field precision and blank test.
              (a) Overview. This test is intended to determine the operational precision of the candidate sampler during a minimum of 10 days of field operation, using three collocated test samplers. Measurements of PM are made at a test site with all of the samplers and then compared to determine replicate precision. Candidate sequential samplers are also subject to a test for possible deposition of particulate matter on inactive filters during a period of storage in the sampler. This procedure is applicable to both reference and equivalent methods. In the case of equivalent methods, this test may be combined and conducted concurrently with the comparability test for equivalent methods (described in subpart C of this part), using three reference method samplers collocated with three candidate equivalent method samplers and meeting the applicable site and other requirements of subpart C of this part.
              (b) Technical definition. (1) Field precision is defined as the standard deviation or relative standard deviation of a set of PM measurements obtained concurrently with three or more collocated samplers in actual ambient air field operation.
              (2) Storage deposition is defined as the mass of material inadvertently deposited on a sample filter that is stored in a sequential sampler either prior to or subsequent to the active sample collection period.
              (c) Test site. Any outdoor test site having PM 2.5 (or PM 10-2.5, as applicable) concentrations that are reasonably uniform over the test area and that meet the minimum level requirement of paragraph (g)(2) of this section is acceptable for this test.
              (d) Required facilities and equipment. (1) An appropriate test site and suitable electrical power to accommodate three test samplers are required.
              (2) Teflon sample filters, as specified in section 6 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, conditioned and preweighed as required by section 8 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, as needed for the test samples.
              (e) Test setup. (1) Three identical test samplers shall be installed at the test site in their normal configuration for collecting PM samples in accordance with the instructions in the associated manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3) and also in accordance with applicable supplemental guidance provided in reference 3 in appendix A of this subpart. The test samplers' inlet openings shall be located at the same height above ground and between 2 (1 for samplers with flow rates less than 200 L/min.) and 4 meters apart horizontally. The samplers shall be arranged or oriented in a manner that will minimize the spatial and wind directional effects on sample collection of one sampler on any other sampler.
              (2) Each test sampler shall be successfully leak checked, calibrated, and set up for normal operation in accordance with the instruction manual and with any applicable supplemental guidance provided in reference 3 in appendix A of this subpart.
              (f) Test procedure. (1) Install a conditioned, preweighed filter in each test sampler and otherwise prepare each sampler for normal sample collection. Set identical sample collection start and stop times for each sampler. For sequential samplers, install a conditioned, preweighed specified filter in each available channel or station intended for automatic sequential sample filter collection (or at least five additional filters for magazine-type sequential samplers), as directed by the sampler's operation or instruction manual. Since the inactive sequential channels are used for the storage deposition part of the test, they may not be used to collect the active PM test samples.
              
              (2) Collect either a nominal 24-hour or 48-hour atmospheric PM sample simultaneously with each of the three test samplers.
              (3) Following sample collection, retrieve the collected sample from each sampler. For sequential samplers, retrieve the additional stored (blank, unsampled) filters after at least 5 days (120 hours) storage in the sampler if the active samples are 24-hour samples, or after at least 10 days (240 hours) if the active samples are 48-hour samples.
              (4) Determine the measured PM mass concentration for each sample in accordance with the applicable procedures prescribed for the candidate method in appendix L or appendix O, as applicable, of part 50 of this chapter, and in accordance with the associated manual referred to in § 53.4(b)(3) and supplemental guidance in reference 2 in appendix A of this subpart. For sequential samplers, also similarly determine the storage deposition as the net weight gain of each blank, unsampled filter after the 5-day (or 10-day) period of storage in the sampler.
              (5) Repeat this procedure to obtain a total of 10 sets of any combination of (nominal) 24-hour or 48-hour PM measurements over 10 test periods. For sequential samplers, repeat the 5-day (or 10-day) storage test of additional blank filters once for a total of two sets of blank filters.
              (g) Calculations. (1) Record the PM concentration for each test sampler for each test period as Ci,j, where i is the sampler number (i = 1,2,3) and j is the test period (j = 1,2, * * * 10).

              (2)(i) For each test period, calculate and record the average of the three measured PM concentrations as Cave,j where j is the test period using equation 26 of this section:
              
                ER41AD07.005
              
              (ii) If Cave,j <3 µg/m3 for any test period, data from that test period are unacceptable, and an additional sample collection set must be obtained to replace the unacceptable data.
              (3)(i) Calculate and record the precision for each of the 10 test periods, as the standard deviation, using equation 27 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.039
              
              (ii) For each of the 10 test periods, also calculate and record the precision as the relative standard deviation, in percent, using equation 28 of this section:
              
                ER17OC06.040
              
              (h) Test results. (1) The candidate method passes the precision test if either Pj or RPj is less than or equal to the corresponding specification in table E-1 of this subpart for all 10 test periods.
              (2) The candidate sequential sampler passes the blank filter storage deposition test if the average net storage deposition weight gain of each set of blank filters (total of the net weight gain of each blank filter divided by the number of filters in the set) from each test sampler (six sets in all) is less than 50 µg.

              § 53.59
              Aerosol transport test for Class I equivalent method samplers.
              (a) Overview. This test is intended to verify adequate aerosol transport through any modified or air flow splitting components that may be used in a Class I candidate equivalent method sampler such as may be necessary to achieve sequential sampling capability. This test is applicable to all Class I candidate samplers in which the aerosol flow path (the flow path through which sample air passes upstream of sample collection filter) differs significantly from that specified for reference method samplers as specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or appendix O, as applicable. The test requirements and performance specifications for this test are summarized in table E-1 of this subpart.
              (b) Technical definitions. (1) Aerosol transport is the percentage of a laboratory challenge aerosol which penetrates to the active sample filter of the candidate equivalent method sampler.
              (2) The active sample filter is the exclusive filter through which sample air is flowing during performance of this test.
              (3) A no-flow filter is a sample filter through which no sample air is intended to flow during performance of this test.
              (4) A channel is any of two or more flow paths that the aerosol may take, only one of which may be active at a time.
              (5) An added component is any physical part of the sampler which is different in some way from that specified for a reference method sampler in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L or appendix O, as applicable, such as a device or means to allow or cause the aerosol to be routed to one of several channels.
              (c) Required facilities and test equipment. (1) Aerosol generation system, as specified in § 53.62(c)(2).
              (2) Aerosol delivery system, as specified in § 53.64(c)(2).
              (3) Particle size verification equipment, as specified in § 53.62(c)(3).
              (4) Fluorometer, as specified in § 53.62(c)(7).
              (5) Candidate test sampler, with the inlet and impactor or impactors removed, and with all internal surfaces of added components electroless nickel coated as specified in § 53.64(d)(2).
              (6) Filters that are appropriate for use with fluorometric methods (e.g., glass fiber).
              (d) Calibration of test measurement instruments. Submit documentation showing evidence of appropriately recent calibration, certification of calibration accuracy, and NIST-traceability (if required) of all measurement instruments used in the tests. The accuracy of flow rate meters shall be verified at the highest and lowest pressures and temperatures used in the tests and shall be checked at zero and at least one flow rate within ±3 percent of 16.7 L/min within 7 days prior to use for this test. Where an instrument's measurements are to be recorded with an analog recording device, the accuracy of the entire instrument-recorder system shall be calibrated or verified.
              (e) Test setup. (1) The candidate test sampler shall have its inlet and impactor or impactors removed. The lower end of the down tube shall be reconnected to the filter holder, using an extension of the downtube, if necessary. If the candidate sampler has a separate impactor for each channel, then for this test, the filter holder assemblies must be connected to the physical location on the sampler where the impactors would normally connect.
              (2) The test particle delivery system shall be connected to the sampler downtube so that the test aerosol is introduced at the top of the downtube.
              (f) Test procedure. (1) All surfaces of the added or modified component or components which come in contact with the aerosol flow shall be thoroughly washed with 0.01 N NaOH and then dried.
              (2) Generate aerosol. (i) Generate aerosol composed of oleic acid with a uranine fluorometric tag of 3 ±0.25 µm aerodynamic diameter using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator according to conventions specified in § 53.61(g).
              (ii) Check for the presence of satellites and adjust the generator to minimize their production.
              (iii) Calculate the aerodynamic particle size using the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator. The calculated aerodynamic diameter must be 3 ±0.25 µm aerodynamic diameter.
              (3) Verify the particle size according to procedures specified in § 53.62(d)(4)(i).
              (4) Collect particles on filters for a time period such that the relative error of the resulting measured fluorometric concentration for the active filter is less than 5 percent.

              (5) Determine the quantity of material collected on the active filter using a calibrated fluorometer. Record the mass of fluorometric material for the active filter as Mactive (i) where i = the active channel number.

              (6) Determine the quantity of material collected on each no-flow filter using a calibrated fluorometer. Record the mass of fluorometric material on each no-flow filter as Mno-flow.

              (7) Using 0.01 N NaOH, wash the surfaces of the added component or components which contact the aerosol flow. Determine the quantity of material collected using a calibrated fluorometer. Record the mass of fluorometric material collected in the wash as Mwash.
              (8) Calculate the aerosol transport as:
              
                
                  Equation 29
                
                ER18jy97.091
              
              
                where:
                
                i = the active channel number.
              
              
              (9) Repeat paragraphs (f)(1) through (8) of this section for each channel, making each channel in turn the exclusive active channel.
              (g) Test results. The candidate Class I sampler passes the aerosol transport test if T(i) is at least 97 percent for each channel.

            Subpart F—Procedures for Testing Performance Characteristics of Class II Equivalent Methods for PM 2.5

              62 FR 38814, July 18, 1997, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 53.60
              General provisions.

              (a) This subpart sets forth the specific requirements that a PM 2.5 sampler associated with a candidate Class II equivalent method must meet to be designated as an equivalent method for PM 2.5. This subpart also sets forth the explicit test procedures that must be carried out and the test results, evidence, documentation, and other materials that must be provided to EPA to demonstrate that a sampler meets all specified requirements for designation as an equivalent method.
              (b) A candidate method described in an application for a FRM or FEM determination submitted under § 53.4 shall be determined by the EPA to be a Class II candidate equivalent method on the basis of the definition of a Class II FEM in § 53.1.

              (c) Any sampler associated with a Class II candidate equivalent method (Class II sampler) must meet all applicable requirements for FRM samplers or Class I FEM samplers specified in subpart E of this part, as appropriate. Except as provided in § 53.3(a)(3), a Class II PM 2.5 sampler must meet the additional requirements as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, all Class II samplers are subject to the additional tests and performance requirements specified in § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), § 53.65 (loading test), and § 53.66 (volatility test). Alternative tests and performance requirements, as described in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, are optionally available for certain Class II samplers which meet the requirements for reference method or Class I equivalent method samplers given in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, and in subpart E of this part, except for specific deviations of the inlet, fractionator, or filter.
              (1) Inlet deviation. A sampler which has been determined to be a Class II sampler solely because the design or construction of its inlet deviates from the design or construction of the inlet specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, for reference method samplers shall not be subject to the requirements of § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), provided that it meets all requirements of § 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), § 53.65 (loading test), and § 53.66 (volatility test).
              (2) Fractionator deviation. A sampler which has been determined to be a Class II sampler solely because the design or construction of its particle size fractionator deviates from the design or construction of the particle size fractionator specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L for reference method samplers shall not be subject to the requirements of § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), provided that it meets all requirements of § 53.64 (static fractionator test), § 53.65 (loading test), and § 53.66 (volatility test).
              (3) Filter size deviation. A sampler which has been determined to be a Class II sampler solely because its effective filtration area deviates from that of the reference method filter specified in 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, for reference method samplers shall not be subject to the requirements of § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test) nor § 53.65 (loading test), provided it meets all requirements of § 53.66 (volatility test).
              (e) The test specifications and acceptance criteria for each test are summarized in table F-1 of this subpart. The candidate sampler must demonstrate performance that meets the acceptance criteria for each applicable test to be designated as an equivalent method.
              (f) Overview of various test procedures for Class II samplers—(1) Full wind tunnel test. This test procedure is designed to ensure that the candidate sampler's effectiveness (aspiration of an ambient aerosol and penetration of the sub 2.5-micron fraction to its sample filter) will be comparable to that of a reference method sampler. The candidate sampler is challenged at wind speeds of 2 and 24 km/hr with monodisperse aerosols of the size specified in table F-2 of this subpart. The experimental test results are then integrated with three idealized ambient distributions (typical, fine, and coarse) to yield the expected mass concentration measurement for each. The acceptance criteria are based on the results of this numerical analysis and the particle diameter for which the sampler effectiveness is 50 percent.
              (2) Wind tunnel inlet aspiration test. The wind tunnel inlet aspiration test directly compares the inlet of the candidate sampler to the inlet of a reference method sampler with the single-sized, liquid, monodisperse challenge aerosol specified in table F-2 of this subpart at wind speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr. The acceptance criteria, presented in table F-1 of this subpart, is based on the relative aspiration between the candidate inlet and the reference method inlet.
              (3) Static fractionator test. The static fractionator test determines the effectiveness of the candidate sampler's 2.5-micron fractionator under static conditions for aerosols of the size specified in table F-2 of this subpart. The numerical analysis procedures and acceptance criteria are identical to those in the full wind tunnel test.
              (4) Loading test. The loading test is conducted to ensure that the performance of a candidate sampler is not significantly affected by the amount of particulate deposited on its interior surfaces between periodic cleanings. The candidate sampler is artificially loaded by sampling a test environment containing aerosolized, standard test dust. The duration of the loading phase is dependent on both the time between cleaning as specified by the candidate method and the aerosol mass concentration in the test environment. After loading, the candidate's performance must then be evaluated by § 53.62 (full wind tunnel evaluation), § 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), or § 53.64 (static fractionator test). If the results of the appropriate test meet the criteria presented in table F-1 of this subpart, then the candidate sampler passes the loading test under the condition that it be cleaned at least as often as the cleaning frequency proposed by the candidate method and that has been demonstrated to be acceptable by this test.
              (5) Volatility test. The volatility test challenges the candidate sampler with a polydisperse, semi-volatile liquid aerosol. This aerosol is simultaneously sampled by the candidate method sampler and a reference method sampler for a specified time period. Clean air is then passed through the samplers during a blow-off time period. Residual mass is then calculated as the weight of the filter after the blow-off phase is subtracted from the initial weight of the filter. Acceptance criteria are based on a comparison of the residual mass measured by the candidate sampler (corrected for flow rate variations from that of the reference method) to the residual mass measured by the reference method sampler for several specified clean air sampling time periods.
              (g) Test data. All test data and other documentation obtained from or pertinent to these tests shall be identified, dated, signed by the analyst performing the test, and submitted to EPA as part of the equivalent method application. Schematic drawings of each particle delivery system and other information showing complete procedural details of the test atmosphere generation, verification, and delivery techniques for each test performed shall be submitted to EPA. All pertinent calculations shall be clearly presented. In addition, manufacturers are required to submit as part of the application, a Designation Testing Checklist (Figure F-1 of this subpart) which has been completed and signed by an ISO-certified auditor.

              § 53.61
              Test conditions.
              (a) Sampler surface preparation. Internal surfaces of the candidate sampler shall be cleaned and dried prior to performing any Class II sampler test in this subpart. The internal collection surfaces of the sampler shall then be prepared in strict accordance with the operating instructions specified in the sampler's operating manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.
              (b) Sampler setup. Set up and start up of all test samplers shall be in strict accordance with the operating instructions specified in the manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L, unless otherwise specified within this subpart.
              (c) Sampler adjustments. Once the test sampler or samplers have been set up and the performance tests started, manual adjustment shall be permitted only between test points for all applicable tests. Manual adjustments and any periodic maintenance shall be limited to only those procedures prescribed in the manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L. The submitted records shall clearly indicate when any manual adjustment or periodic maintenance was made and shall describe the operations performed.
              (d) Sampler malfunctions. If a test sampler malfunctions during any of the applicable tests, that test run shall be repeated. A detailed explanation of all malfunctions and the remedial actions taken shall be submitted as part of the equivalent method application.
              (e) Particle concentration measurements. All measurements of particle concentration must be made such that the relative error in measurement is less than 5.0 percent. Relative error is defined as (s × 100 percent)/(X), where s is the sample standard deviation of the particle concentration detector, X is the measured concentration, and the units of s and X are identical.
              
              (f) Operation of test measurement equipment. All test measurement equipment shall be set up, calibrated, and maintained by qualified personnel according to the manufacturer's instructions. All appropriate calibration information and manuals for this equipment shall be kept on file.
              (g) Vibrating orifice aerosol generator conventions. This section prescribes conventions regarding the use of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator (VOAG) for the size-selective performance tests outlined in §§ 53.62, 53.63, 53.64, and 53.65.
              (1) Particle aerodynamic diameter. The VOAG produces near-monodisperse droplets through the controlled breakup of a liquid jet. When the liquid solution consists of a non-volatile solute dissolved in a volatile solvent, the droplets dry to form particles of near-monodisperse size.
              (i) The physical diameter of a generated spherical particle can be calculated from the operating parameters of the VOAG as:
              
                
                  Equation 1
                
                ER18jy97.094
              
              
                where:
                
                Dp = particle physical diameter, µm;
                Q = liquid volumetric flow rate, µm3/sec;
                Cvol = volume concentration (particle volume produced per drop volume), dimensionless; and
                f = frequency of applied vibrational signal, 1/sec.
              
              

              (ii) A given particle's aerodynamic behavior is a function of its physical particle size, particle shape, and density. Aerodynamic diameter is defined as the diameter of a unit density (ρo = 1g/cm3) sphere having the same settling velocity as the particle under consideration. For converting a spherical particle of known density to aerodynamic diameter, the governing relationship is:

                where:
                
                Dae = particle aerodynamic diameter, µm;
                ρp = particle density, g/cm3;
                ρo = aerodynamic particle density = 1 g/cm3;
                CDp = Cunningham's slip correction factor for physical particle diameter, dimensionless; and
                CDae = Cunningham's slip correction factor for aerodynamic particle diameter, dimensionless.
              
              
              (iii) At room temperature and standard pressure, the Cunningham's slip correction factor is solely a function of particle diameter:
              
                
                  Equation 3
                
                ER18jy97.096
              
              or
              
                
                  Equation 4
                
                ER18jy97.097
              
              (iv) Since the slip correction factor is itself a function of particle diameter, the aerodynamic diameter in equation 2 of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section cannot be solved directly but must be determined by iteration.
              (2) Solid particle generation. (i) Solid particle tests performed in this subpart shall be conducted using particles composed of ammonium fluorescein. For use in the VOAG, liquid solutions of known volumetric concentration can be prepared by diluting fluorescein powder (C20H12O5, FW = 332.31, CAS 2321-07-5) with aqueous ammonia. Guidelines for preparation of fluorescein solutions of the desired volume concentration (Cvol) are presented by Vanderpool and Rubow (1988) (Reference 2 in appendix A of this subpart). For purposes of converting particle physical diameter to aerodynamic diameter, an ammonium fluorescein density of 1.35 g/cm3 shall be used.
              
              (ii) Mass deposits of ammonium fluorescein shall be extracted and analyzed using solutions of 0.01 N ammonium hydroxide.
              (3) Liquid particle generation. (i) Tests prescribed in § 53.63 for inlet aspiration require the use of liquid particle tests composed of oleic acid tagged with uranine to enable subsequent fluorometric quantitation of collected aerosol mass deposits. Oleic acid (C18H34O2, FW = 282.47, CAS 112-80-1) has a density of 0.8935 g/cm3. Because the viscosity of oleic acid is relatively high, significant errors can occur when dispensing oleic acid using volumetric pipettes. For this reason, it is recommended that oleic acid solutions be prepared by quantifying dispensed oleic acid gravimetrically. The volume of oleic acid dispensed can then be calculated simply by dividing the dispensed mass by the oleic acid density.

              (ii) Oleic acid solutions tagged with uranine shall be prepared as follows. A known mass of oleic acid shall first be diluted using absolute ethanol. The desired mass of the uranine tag should then be diluted in a separate container using absolute ethanol. Uranine (C20H10O5Na2, FW = 376.3, CAS 518-47-8) is the disodium salt of fluorescein and has a density of 1.53 g/cm3. In preparing uranine tagged oleic acid particles, the uranine content shall not exceed 20 percent on a mass basis. Once both oleic acid and uranine solutions are properly prepared, they can then be combined and diluted to final volume using absolute ethanol.

              (iii) Calculation of the physical diameter of the particles produced by the VOAG requires knowledge of the liquid solution's volume concentration (Cvol). Because uranine is essentially insoluble in oleic acid, the total particle volume is the sum of the oleic acid volume and the uranine volume. The volume concentration of the liquid solution shall be calculated as:
              
                
                  Equation 5
                
                ER18jy97.098
              
              
                where:
                
                Vu = uranine volume, ml;
                Voleic = oleic acid volume, ml;
                Vsol = total solution volume, ml;
                Mu = uranine mass, g;
                ρu = uranine density, g/cm3;
                Moleic = oleic acid mass, g; and
                ρoleic = oleic acid density, g/cm. 3
                
              
              
              (iv) For purposes of converting the particles' physical diameter to aerodynamic diameter, the density of the generated particles shall be calculated as:
              
                
                  Equation 6
                
                ER18jy97.099
              
              (v) Mass deposits of oleic acid shall be extracted and analyzed using solutions of 0.01 N sodium hydroxide.

              § 53.62
              Test procedure: Full wind tunnel test.
              (a) Overview. The full wind tunnel test evaluates the effectiveness of the candidate sampler at 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr for aerosols of the size specified in table F-2 of this subpart (under the heading, “Full Wind Tunnel Test”). For each wind speed, a smooth curve is fit to the effectiveness data and corrected for the presence of multiplets in the wind tunnel calibration aerosol. The cutpoint diameter (Dp50) at each wind speed is then determined from the corrected effectiveness curves. The two resultant penetration curves are then each numerically integrated with three idealized ambient particle size distributions to provide six estimates of measured mass concentration. Critical parameters for these idealized distributions are presented in table F-3 of this subpart.
              (b) Technical definitions. Effectiveness is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a specific size reaching the sampler filter or filters to the mass concentration of particles of the same size approaching the sampler.
              (c) Facilities and equipment required—(1) Wind tunnel. The particle delivery system shall consist of a blower system and a wind tunnel having a test section of sufficiently large cross-sectional area such that the test sampler, or portion thereof, as installed in the test section for testing, blocks no more than 15 percent of the test section area. The wind tunnel blower system must be capable of maintaining uniform wind speeds at the 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr in the test section.
              (2) Aerosol generation system. A vibrating orifice aerosol generator shall be used to produce monodisperse solid particles of ammonium fluorescein with equivalent aerodynamic diameters as specified in table F-2 of this subpart. The geometric standard deviation for each particle size generated shall not exceed 1.1 (for primary particles) and the proportion of multiplets (doublets and triplets) in all test particle atmosphere shall not exceed 10 percent of the particle population. The aerodynamic particle diameter, as established by the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator, shall be within the tolerance specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
              (3) Particle size verification equipment. The size of the test particles shall be verified during this test by use of a suitable instrument (e.g., scanning electron microscope, optical particle sizer, time-of-flight apparatus). The instrument must be capable of measuring solid and liquid test particles with a size resolution of 0.1 µm or less. The accuracy of the particle size verification technique shall be 0.15 µm or better.
              (4) Wind speed measurement. The wind speed in the wind tunnel shall be determined during the tests using an appropriate technique capable of a precision of 2 percent and an accuracy of 5 percent or better (e.g., hot-wire anemometry). For the wind speeds specified in table F-2 of this subpart, the wind speed shall be measured at a minimum of 12 test points in a cross-sectional area of the test section of the wind tunnel. The mean wind speed in the test section must be within ±10 percent of the value specified in table F-2 of this subpart, and the variation at any test point in the test section may not exceed 10 percent of the measured mean.
              (5) Aerosol rake. The cross-sectional uniformity of the particle concentration in the sampling zone of the test section shall be established during the tests using an array of isokinetic samplers, referred to as a rake. Not less than five evenly spaced isokinetic samplers shall be used to determine the particle concentration spatial uniformity in the sampling zone. The sampling zone shall be a rectangular area having a horizontal dimension not less than 1.2 times the width of the test sampler at its inlet opening and a vertical dimension not less than 25 centimeters.
              (6) Total aerosol isokinetic sampler. After cross-sectional uniformity has been confirmed, a single isokinetic sampler may be used in place of the array of isokinetic samplers for the determination of particle mass concentration used in the calculation of sampling effectiveness of the test sampler in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. In this case, the array of isokinetic samplers must be used to demonstrate particle concentration uniformity prior to the replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.
              (7) Fluorometer. A fluorometer used for quantifying extracted aerosol mass deposits shall be set up, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. A series of calibration standards shall be prepared to encompass the minimum and maximum concentrations measured during size-selective tests. Prior to each calibration and measurement, the fluorometer shall be zeroed using an aliquot of the same solvent used for extracting aerosol mass deposits.
              (8) Sampler flow rate measurements. All flow rate measurements used to calculate the test atmosphere concentrations and the test results must be accurate to within ±2 percent, referenced to a NIST-traceable primary standard. Any necessary flow rate measurement corrections shall be clearly documented. All flow rate measurements shall be performed and reported in actual volumetric units.
              (d) Test procedures—(1) Establish and verify wind speed. (i) Establish a wind speed specified in table F-2 of this subpart.

              (ii) Measure the wind speed at a minimum of 12 test points in a cross-sectional area of the test section of the wind tunnel using a device as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
              
              (iii) Verify that the mean wind speed in the test section of the wind tunnel during the tests is within 10 percent of the value specified in table F-2 of this subpart. The wind speed measured at any test point in the test section shall not differ by more than 10 percent from the mean wind speed in the test section.
              (2) Generate aerosol. (i) Generate particles of a size specified in table F-2 of this subpart using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator.
              (ii) Check for the presence of satellites and adjust the generator as necessary.
              (iii) Calculate the physical particle size using the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator and record.
              (iv) Determine the particle's aerodynamic diameter from the calculated physical diameter and the known density of the generated particle. The calculated aerodynamic diameter must be within the tolerance specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
              (3) Introduce particles into the wind tunnel. Introduce the generated particles into the wind tunnel and allow the particle concentration to stabilize.
              (4) Verify the quality of the test aerosol. (i) Extract a representative sample of the aerosol from the sampling test zone and measure the size distribution of the collected particles using an appropriate sizing technique. If the measurement technique does not provide a direct measure of aerodynamic diameter, the geometric mean aerodynamic diameter of the challenge aerosol must be calculated using the known density of the particle and the measured mean physical diameter. The determined geometric mean aerodynamic diameter of the test aerosol must be within 0.15 µm of the aerodynamic diameter calculated from the operating parameters of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator. The geometric standard deviation of the primary particles must not exceed 1.1.
              (ii) Determine the population of multiplets in the collected sample. The multiplet population of the particle test atmosphere must not exceed 10 percent of the total particle population.
              (5) Aerosol uniformity and concentration measurement. (i) Install an array of five or more evenly spaced isokinetic samplers in the sampling zone (paragraph (c)(5) of this section). Collect particles on appropriate filters over a time period such that the relative error of the measured particle concentration is less than 5.0 percent.
              (ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with each isokinetic sampler in the array using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration for each isokinetic sampler as:
              
                
                  Equation 7
                
                ER18jy97.100
              
              
                where:
                
                i = replicate number;
                j = isokinetic sampler number;
                Miso = mass of material collected with the isokinetic sampler;
                Q = isokinetic sampler volumetric flow rate; and
                t = sampling time.
              
              
              (iii) Calculate and record the mean mass concentration as:
              
                
                  Equation 8
                
                ER18jy97.101
              
              
                where:
                
                i = replicate number;
                j = isokinetic sampler number; and
                n = total number of isokinetic samplers.
              
              
              (iv) Precision calculation. (A) Calculate the coefficient of variation of the mass concentration measurements as:
              
                
                  Equation 9
                
                ER18jy97.102
              
              
                where:
                
                i = replicate number;
                j = isokinetic sampler number; and
                n = total number of isokinetic samplers.
              
              
              
              (B) If the value of CViso(i) for any replicate exceeds 10 percent, the particle concentration uniformity is unacceptable and step 5 must be repeated. If adjustment of the vibrating orifice aerosol generator or changes in the particle delivery system are necessary to achieve uniformity, steps 1 through 5 must be repeated. When an acceptable aerosol spatial uniformity is achieved, remove the array of isokinetic samplers from the wind tunnel.
              (6) Alternative measure of wind tunnel total concentration. If a single isokinetic sampler is used to determine the mean aerosol concentration in the wind tunnel, install the sampler in the wind tunnel with the sampler nozzle centered in the sampling zone (paragraph (c)(6) of this section).
              (i) Collect particles on an appropriate filter over a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 5.0 percent.
              (ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the isokinetic sampler using a calibrated fluorometer.

              (iii) Calculate and record the mass concentration as Ciso(i) as in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section.
              (iv) Remove the isokinetic sampler from the wind tunnel.
              (7) Measure the aerosol with the candidate sampler. (i) Install the test sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind tunnel with the sampler inlet opening centered in the sampling zone. To meet the maximum blockage limit of paragraph (c)(1) of this section or for convenience, part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 5.0 percent.
              (ii) Remove the test sampler from the wind tunnel.
              (iii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the test sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration for each replicate as:
              
                
                  Equation 10
                
                ER18jy97.103
              
              
                where:
                
                i = replicate number;
                Mcand = mass of material collected with the candidate sampler;
                Q = candidate sampler volumetric flow rate; and
                t = sampling time.
              
              
              (iv)(A) Calculate and record the sampling effectiveness of the candidate sampler as:
              
                
                  Equation 11
                
                ER18jy97.104
              
              
                where:
                
                i = replicate number.
              
              

              (B) If a single isokinetic sampler is used for the determination of particle mass concentration, replace Ciso(i) with Ciso.
              (8) Replicate measurements and calculation of mean sampling effectiveness. (i) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(5) through (d)(7) of this section, as appropriate, to obtain a minimum of three valid replicate measurements of sampling effectiveness.
              (ii) Calculate and record the average sampling effectiveness of the test sampler for the particle size as:
              
                
                  Equation 12

                where:
                
                i = replicate number; and
                n = number of replicates.
              
              
              (iii) Sampling effectiveness precision. (A) Calculate and record the coefficient of variation for the replicate sampling effectiveness measurements of the test sampler as:

                ER18jy97.106
              
              
                where:
                
                i = replicate number, and
                n = number of replicates.
              
              
              (B) If the value of CVE exceeds 10 percent, the test run (steps in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(8) of this section) must be repeated until an acceptable value is obtained.
              (9) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(8) of this section until the sampling effectiveness has been measured for all particle sizes specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
              (10) Repeat steps in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(9) of this section until tests have been successfully conducted for both wind speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr.
              (e) Calculations—(1) Graphical treatment of effectiveness data. For each wind speed given in table F-2 of this subpart, plot the particle average sampling effectiveness of the candidate sampler as a function of aerodynamic particle diameter (Dae) on semi-logarithmic graph paper where the aerodynamic particle diameter is the particle size established by the parameters of the VOAG in conjunction with the known particle density. Construct a best-fit, smooth curve through the data by extrapolating the sampling effectiveness curve through 100 percent at an aerodynamic particle size of 0.5 µm and 0 percent at an aerodynamic particle size of 10 µm. Correction for the presence of multiplets shall be performed using the techniques presented by Marple, et al (1987). This multiplet-corrected effectiveness curve shall be used for all remaining calculations in this paragraph (e).
              (2) Cutpoint determination. For each wind speed determine the sampler Dp50 cutpoint defined as the aerodynamic particle size corresponding to 50 percent effectiveness from the multiplet corrected smooth curve.
              (3) Expected mass concentration calculation. For each wind speed, calculate the estimated mass concentration measurement for the test sampler under each particle size distribution (Tables F-4, F-5, and F-6 of this subpart) and compare it to the mass concentration predicted for the reference sampler as follows:
              (i) Determine the value of corrected effectiveness using the best-fit, multiplet-corrected curve at each of the particle sizes specified in the first column of table F-4 of this subpart. Record each corrected effectiveness value as a decimal between 0 and 1 in column 2 of table F-4 of this subpart.
              (ii) Calculate the interval estimated mass concentration measurement by multiplying the values of corrected effectiveness in column 2 by the interval mass concentration values in column 3 and enter the products in column 4 of table F-4 of this subpart.
              (iii) Calculate the estimated mass concentration measurement by summing the values in column 4 and entering the total as the estimated mass concentration measurement for the test sampler at the bottom of column 4 of table F-4 of this subpart.
              (iv) Calculate the estimated mass concentration ratio between the candidate method and the reference method as:
              
                
                  Equation 14
                
                ER18jy97.107
              
              
                where:
                
                Ccand(est) = estimated mass concentration measurement for the test sampler, µg/m3; and
                Cref(est) = estimated mass concentration measurement for the reference sampler, µg/m3 (calculated for the reference sampler and specified at the bottom of column 7 of table F-4 of this subpart).
              
              
              (v) Repeat steps in paragraphs (e) (1) through (e)(3) of this section for tables F-5 and F-6 of this subpart.
              (f) Evaluation of test results. The candidate method passes the wind tunnel effectiveness test if the Rc value for each wind speed meets the specification in table F-1 of this subpart for each of the three particle size distributions.
            
            
              
              § 53.63
              Test procedure: Wind tunnel inlet aspiration test.
              (a) Overview. This test applies to a candidate sampler which differs from the reference method sampler only with respect to the design of the inlet. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the aspiration of a Class II candidate sampler is such that it representatively extracts an ambient aerosol at elevated wind speeds. This wind tunnel test uses a single-sized, liquid aerosol in conjunction with wind speeds of 2 km/hr and 24 km/hr. The test atmosphere concentration is alternately measured with the candidate sampler and a reference method device, both of which are operated without the 2.5-micron fractionation device installed. The test conditions are summarized in table F-2 of this subpart (under the heading of “wind tunnel inlet aspiration test”). The candidate sampler must meet or exceed the acceptance criteria given in table F-1 of this subpart.
              (b) Technical definition. Relative aspiration is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the aerosol mass concentration measured by the candidate sampler to that measured by a reference method sampler.
              (c) Facilities and equipment required. The facilities and equipment are identical to those required for the full wind tunnel test (§ 53.62(c)).
              (d) Setup. The candidate and reference method samplers shall be operated with the PM 2.5 fractionation device removed from the flow path throughout this entire test procedure. Modifications to accommodate this requirement shall be limited to removal of the fractionator and insertion of the filter holder directly into the downtube of the inlet.
              (e) Test procedure—(1) Establish the wind tunnel test atmosphere. Follow the procedures in § 53.62(d)(1) through (d)(4) to establish a test atmosphere for one of the two wind speeds specified in table F-2 of this subpart.
              (2) Measure the aerosol concentration with the reference sampler. (i) Install the reference sampler (or portion thereof) in the wind tunnel with the sampler inlet opening centered in the sampling zone. To meet the maximum blockage limit of § 53.62(c)(1) or for convenience, part of the test sampler may be positioned external to the wind tunnel provided that neither the geometry of the sampler nor the length of any connecting tube or pipe is altered. Collect particles for a time period such that the relative error of the measured concentration is less than 5.0 percent.
              (ii) Determine the quantity of material collected with the reference method sampler using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the mass concentration as:

              § 53.64
              Test procedure: Static fractionator test.
              (a) Overview. This test applies only to those candidate methods in which the sole deviation from the reference method is in the design of the 2.5-micron fractionation device. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the fractionation characteristics of the candidate fractionator are acceptably similar to that of the reference method sampler. It is recognized that various methodologies exist for quantifying fractionator effectiveness. The following commonly-employed techniques are provided for purposes of guidance. Other methodologies for determining sampler effectiveness may be used contingent upon prior approval by the Agency.
              (1) Wash-off method. Effectiveness is determined by measuring the aerosol mass deposited on the candidate sampler's after filter versus the aerosol mass deposited in the fractionator. The material deposited in the fractionator is recovered by washing its internal surfaces. For these wash-off tests, a fluorometer must be used to quantitate the aerosol concentration. Note that if this technique is chosen, the candidate must be reloaded with coarse aerosol prior to each test point when reevaluating the curve as specified in the loading test.
              (2) Static chamber method. Effectiveness is determined by measuring the aerosol mass concentration sampled by the candidate sampler's after filter versus that which exists in a static chamber. A calibrated fluorometer shall be used to quantify the collected aerosol deposits. The aerosol concentration is calculated as the measured aerosol mass divided by the sampled air volume.
              (3) Divided flow method. Effectiveness is determined by comparing the aerosol concentration upstream of the candidate sampler's fractionator versus that concentration which exists downstream of the candidate fractionator. These tests may utilize either fluorometry or a real-time aerosol measuring device to determine the aerosol concentration.
              (b) Technical definition. Effectiveness under static conditions is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a given size reaching the sampler filter to the mass concentration of particles of the same size existing in the test atmosphere.
              (c) Facilities and equipment required—(1) Aerosol generation. Methods for generating aerosols shall be identical to those prescribed in § 53.62(c)(2).
              (2) Particle delivery system. Acceptable apparatus for delivering the generated aerosols to the candidate fractionator is dependent on the effectiveness measurement methodology and shall be defined as follows:
              (i) Wash-off test apparatus. The aerosol may be delivered to the candidate fractionator through direct piping (with or without an in-line mixing chamber). Validation particle size and quality shall be conducted at a point directly upstream of the fractionator.
              (ii) Static chamber test apparatus. The aerosol shall be introduced into a chamber and sufficiently mixed such that the aerosol concentration within the chamber is spatially uniform. The chamber must be of sufficient size to house at least four total filter samplers in addition to the inlet of the candidate method size fractionator. Validation of particle size and quality shall be conducted on representative aerosol samples extracted from the chamber.
              (iii) Divided flow test apparatus. The apparatus shall allow the aerosol concentration to be measured upstream and downstream of the fractionator. The aerosol shall be delivered to a manifold with two symmetrical branching legs. One of the legs, referred to as the bypass leg, shall allow the challenge aerosol to pass unfractionated to the detector. The other leg shall accommodate the fractionation device.
              (3) Particle concentration measurement—(i) Fluorometry. Refer to § 53.62(c)(7).
              (ii) Number concentration measurement. A number counting particle sizer may be used in conjunction with the divided flow test apparatus in lieu of fluorometric measurement. This device must have a minimum range of 1 to 10 µm, a resolution of 0.1 µm, and an accuracy of 0.15 µm such that primary particles may be distinguished from multiplets for all test aerosols. The measurement of number concentration shall be accomplished by integrating the primary particle peak.
              (d) Setup—(1) Remove the inlet and downtube from the candidate fractionator. All tests procedures shall be conducted with the inlet and downtube removed from the candidate sampler.
              (2) Surface treatment of the fractionator. Rinsing aluminum surfaces with alkaline solutions has been found to adversely affect subsequent fluorometric quantitation of aerosol mass deposits. If wash-off tests are to be used for quantifying aerosol penetration, internal surfaces of the fractionator must first be plated with electroless nickel. Specifications for this plating are specified in Society of Automotive Engineers Aerospace Material Specification (SAE AMS) 2404C, Electroless Nickel Plating (Reference 3 in appendix A of subpart F).
              (e) Test procedure: Wash-off method—(1) Clean the candidate sampler. Note: The procedures in this step may be omitted if this test is being used to evaluate the fractionator after being loaded as specified in § 53.65.
              (i) Clean and dry the internal surfaces of the candidate sampler.
              (ii) Prepare the internal fractionator surfaces in strict accordance with the operating instructions specified in the sampler's operating manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.
              (2) Generate aerosol. Follow the procedures for aerosol generation prescribed in § 53.62(d)(2).
              (3) Verify the quality of the test aerosol. Follow the procedures for verification of test aerosol size and quality prescribed in § 53.62(d)(4).
              (4) Determine effectiveness for the particle size being produced. (i) Collect particles downstream of the fractionator on an appropriate filter over a time period such that the relative error of the fluorometric measurement is less than 5.0 percent.
              (ii) Determine the quantity of material collected on the after filter of the candidate method using a calibrated fluorometer. Calculate and record the aerosol mass concentration for the sampler filter as:

              § 53.65
              Test procedure: Loading test.
              (a) Overview. (1) The loading tests are designed to quantify any appreciable changes in a candidate method sampler's performance as a function of coarse aerosol collection. The candidate sampler is exposed to a mass of coarse aerosol equivalent to sampling a mass concentration of 150 µg/m3 over the time period that the manufacturer has specified between periodic cleaning. After loading, the candidate sampler is then evaluated by performing the test in § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test), § 53.63 (wind tunnel inlet aspiration test), or § 53.64 (static fractionator test). If the acceptance criteria are met for this evaluation test, then the candidate sampler is approved for multi-day sampling with the periodic maintenance schedule as specified by the candidate method. For example, if the candidate sampler passes the reevaluation tests following loading with an aerosol mass equivalent to sampling a 150 µg/m3 aerosol continuously for 7 days, then the sampler is approved for 7 day field operation before cleaning is required.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (b) Technical definition. Effectiveness after loading is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the mass concentration of particles of a given size reaching the sampler filter to the mass concentration of particles of the same size approaching the sampler.
              (c) Facilities and equipment required—(1) Particle delivery system. The particle delivery system shall consist of a static chamber or a low velocity wind tunnel having a sufficiently large cross-sectional area such that the test sampler, or portion thereof, may be installed in the test section. At a minimum, the system must have a sufficiently large cross section to house the candidate sampler inlet as well as a collocated isokinetic nozzle for measuring total aerosol concentration. The mean velocity in the test section of the static chamber or wind tunnel shall not exceed 2 km/hr.
              (2) Aerosol generation equipment. For purposes of these tests, the test aerosol shall be produced from commercially available, bulk Arizona road dust. To provide direct interlaboratory comparability of sampler loading characteristics, the bulk dust is specified as 0-10 µm ATD available from Powder Technology Incorporated (Burnsville, MN). A fluidized bed aerosol generator, Wright dust feeder, or sonic nozzle shall be used to efficiently deagglomerate the bulk test dust and transform it into an aerosol cloud. Other dust generators may be used contingent upon prior approval by the Agency.
              (3) Isokinetic sampler. Mean aerosol concentration within the static chamber or wind tunnel shall be established using a single isokinetic sampler containing a preweighed high-efficiency total filter.
              (4) Analytic balance. An analytical balance shall be used to determine the weight of the total filter in the isokinetic sampler. The precision and accuracy of this device shall be such that the relative measurement error is less than 5.0 percent for the difference between the initial and final weight of the total filter. The identical analytic balance shall be used to perform both initial and final weighing of the total filter.
              (d) Test procedure. (1) Calculate and record the target time weighted concentration of Arizona road dust which is equivalent to exposing the sampler to an environment of 150 µg/m3 over the time between cleaning specified by the candidate sampler's operations manual as:

                ER18jy97.133
              
              
                where:
                
                t = the number of hours specified by the candidate method prior to periodic cleaning.
              
              
              (2) Clean the candidate sampler. (i) Clean and dry the internal surfaces of the candidate sampler.
              (ii) Prepare the internal surfaces in strict accordance with the operating manual referred to in section 7.4.18 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix L.
              (3) Determine the preweight of the filter that shall be used in the isokinetic sampler. Record this value as InitWt.
              (4) Install the candidate sampler's inlet and the isokinetic sampler within the test chamber or wind tunnel.
              (5) Generate a dust cloud. (i) Generate a dust cloud composed of Arizona test dust.
              (ii) Introduce the dust cloud into the chamber.
              (iii) Allow sufficient time for the particle concentration to become steady within the chamber.
              (6) Sample aerosol with a total filter and the candidate sampler. (i) Sample the aerosol for a time sufficient to produce an equivalent TWC equal to that of the target TWC ±15 percent.
              (ii) Record the sampling time as t.
              (7) Determine the time weighted concentration. (i) Determine the postweight of the isokinetic sampler's total filter.
              (ii) Record this value as FinalWt.
              (iii) Calculate and record the TWC as:
              
                
                  Equation 41
                
                ER18jy97.134
              
              
                where:
                
                Q = the flow rate of the candidate method.
              
              
              (iv) If the value of TWC deviates from the target TWC ±15 percent, then the loaded mass is unacceptable and the entire test procedure must be repeated.
              (8) Determine the candidate sampler's effectiveness after loading. The candidate sampler's effectiveness as a function of particle aerodynamic diameter must then be evaluated by performing the test in § 53.62 (full wind tunnel test). A sampler which fits the category of inlet deviation in § 53.60(e)(1) may opt to perform the test in § 53.63 (inlet aspiration test) in lieu of the full wind tunnel test. A sampler which fits the category of fractionator deviation in § 53.60(e)(2) may opt to perform the test in § 53.64 (static fractionator test) in lieu of the full wind tunnel test.
              (e) Test results. If the candidate sampler meets the acceptance criteria for the evaluation test performed in paragraph (d)(8) of this section, then the candidate sampler passes this test with the stipulation that the sampling train be cleaned as directed by and as frequently as that specified by the candidate sampler's operations manual.
            
            
              § 53.66
              Test procedure: Volatility test.
              (a) Overview. This test is designed to ensure that the candidate method's losses due to volatility when sampling semi-volatile ambient aerosol will be comparable to that of a federal reference method sampler. This is accomplished by challenging the candidate sampler with a polydisperse, semi-volatile liquid aerosol in three distinct phases. During phase A of this test, the aerosol is elevated to a steady-state, test-specified mass concentration and the sample filters are conditioned and preweighed. In phase B, the challenge aerosol is simultaneously sampled by the candidate method sampler and a reference method sampler onto the preweighed filters for a specified time period. In phase C (the blow-off phase), aerosol and aerosol-vapor free air is sampled by the samplers for an additional time period to partially volatilize the aerosol on the filters. The candidate sampler passes the volatility test if the acceptance criteria presented in table F-1 of this subpart are met or exceeded.
              (b) Technical definitions. (1) Residual mass (RM) is defined as the weight of the filter after the blow-off phase subtracted from the initial weight of the filter.
              (2) Corrected residual mass (CRM) is defined as the residual mass of the filter from the candidate sampler multiplied by the ratio of the reference method flow rate to the candidate method flow rate.
              (c) Facilities and equipment required—(1) Environmental chamber. Because the nature of a volatile aerosol is greatly dependent upon environmental conditions, all phases of this test shall be conducted at a temperature of 22.0 ±0.5 °C and a relative humidity of 40 ±3 percent. For this reason, it is strongly advised that all weighing and experimental apparatus be housed in an environmental chamber capable of this level of control.
              (2) Aerosol generator. The aerosol generator shall be a pressure nebulizer operated at 20 to 30 psig (140 to 207 kPa) to produce a polydisperse, semi-voltile aerosol with a mass median diameter larger than 1 µm and smaller than 2.5 µm. The nebulized liquid shall be A.C.S. reagent grade glycerol (C3H8O, FW = 92.09, CAS 56-81-5) of 99.5 percent minimum purity. For the purpose of this test the accepted mass median diameter is predicated on the stable aerosol inside the internal chamber and not on the aerosol emerging from the nebulizer nozzle. Aerosol monitoring and its stability are described in (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.
              (3) Aerosol monitoring equipment. The evaporation and condensation dynamics of a volatile aerosol is greatly dependent upon the vapor pressure of the volatile component in the carrier gas. The size of an aerosol becomes fixed only when an equilibrium is established between the aerosol and the surrounding vapor; therefore, aerosol size measurement shall be used as a surrogate measure of this equilibrium. A suitable instrument with a range of 0.3 to 10 µm, an accuracy of 0.5 µm, and a resolution of 0.2 µm (e.g., an optical particle sizer, or a time-of-flight instrument) shall be used for this purpose. The parameter monitored for stability shall be the mass median instrument measured diameter (i.e. optical diameter if an optical particle counter is used). A stable aerosol shall be defined as an aerosol with a mass median diameter that has changed less than 0.25 µm over a 4 hour time period.
              (4) Internal chamber. The time required to achieve a stable aerosol depends upon the time during which the aerosol is resident with the surrounding air. This is a function of the internal volume of the aerosol transport system and may be facilitated by recirculating the challenge aerosol. A chamber with a volume of 0.5 m3 and a recirculating loop (airflow of approximately 500 cfm) is recommended for this purpose. In addition, a baffle is recommended to dissipate the jet of air that the recirculating loop can create. Furthermore, a HEPA filtered hole in the wall of the chamber is suggested to allow makeup air to enter the chamber or excess air to exit the chamber to maintain a system flow balance. The concentration inside the chamber shall be maintained at 1 mg/m3 ±20 percent to obtain consistent and significant filter loading.
              (5) Aerosol sampling manifold. A manifold shall be used to extract the aerosol from the area in which it is equilibrated and transport it to the candidate method sampler, the reference method sampler, and the aerosol monitor. The losses in each leg of the manifold shall be equivalent such that the three devices will be exposed to an identical aerosol.
              (6) Chamber air temperature recorders. Minimum range 15-25 °C, certified accuracy to within 0.2 °C, resolution of 0.1 °C. Measurement shall be made at the intake to the sampling manifold and adjacent to the weighing location.
              (7) Chamber air relative humidity recorders. Minimum range 30 - 50 percent, certified accuracy to within 1 percent, resolution of 0.5 percent. Measurement shall be made at the intake to the sampling manifold and adjacent to the weighing location.
              (8) Clean air generation system. A source of aerosol and aerosol-vapor free air is required for phase C of this test. This clean air shall be produced by filtering air through an absolute (HEPA) filter.
              (9) Balance. Minimum range 0 - 200 mg, certified accuracy to within 10 µg, resolution of 1 µg.
              (d) Additional filter handling conditions—(1) Filter handling. Careful handling of the filter during sampling, conditioning, and weighing is necessary to avoid errors due to damaged filters or loss of collected particles from the filters. All filters must be weighed immediately after phase A dynamic conditioning and phase C.
              (2) Dynamic conditioning of filters. Total dynamic conditioning is required prior to the initial weight determined in phase A. Dynamic conditioning refers to pulling clean air from the clean air generation system through the filters. Total dynamic conditioning can be established by sequential filter weighing every 30 minutes following repetitive dynamic conditioning. The filters are considered sufficiently conditioned if the sequential weights are repeatable to ±3 µg.
              (3) Static charge. The following procedure is suggested for minimizing charge effects. Place six or more Polonium static control devices (PSCD) inside the microbalance weighing chamber, (MWC). Two of them must be placed horizontally on the floor of the MWC and the remainder placed vertically on the back wall of the MWC. Taping two PSCD's together or using double-sided tape will help to keep them from falling. Place the filter that is to be weighed on the horizontal PSCDs facing aerosol coated surface up. Close the MWC and wait 1 minute. Open the MWC and place the filter on the balance dish. Wait 1 minute. If the charges have been neutralized the weight will stabilize within 30-60 seconds. Repeat the procedure of neutralizing charges and weighing as prescribed above several times (typically 2-4 times) until consecutive weights will differ by no more than 3 micrograms. Record the last measured weight and use this value for all subsequent calculations.
              (e) Test procedure—(1) Phase A - Preliminary steps. (i) Generate a polydisperse glycerol test aerosol.
              (ii) Introduce the aerosol into the transport system.
              (iii) Monitor the aerosol size and concentration until stability and level have been achieved.
              (iv) Condition the candidate method sampler and reference method sampler filters until total dynamic conditioning is achieved as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

              (v) Record the dynamically conditioned weight as InitWtc and InitWtr where c is the candidate method sampler and r is the reference method sampler.
              (2) Phase B - Aerosol loading. (i) Install the dynamically conditioned filters into the appropriate samplers.
              (ii) Attach the samplers to the manifold.
              (iii) Operate the candidate and the reference samplers such that they simultaneously sample the test aerosol for 2 hours for a candidate sampler operating at 16.7 L/min or higher, or proportionately longer for a candidate sampler operating at a lower flow rate.
              (3) Phase C - Blow-off. (i) Alter the intake of the samplers to sample air from the clean air generation system.
              (ii) Sample clean air for one of the required blow-off time durations (1, 2, 3, and 4 hours).
              (iii) Remove the filters from the samplers.

              (iv) Weigh the filters immediately and record this weight, FinalWtc and FinalWtr, where c is the candidate method sampler and r is the reference method sampler.
              (v) Calculate the residual mass for the reference method sampler:

            § 55.1
            Statutory authority and scope.

            Section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (“the Act”), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to establish requirements to control air pollution from outer continental shelf (“OCS”) sources in order to attain and maintain Federal and State ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. This part establishes the air pollution control requirements for OCS sources and the procedures for implementation and enforcement of the requirements, consistent with these stated objectives of section 328(a)(1) of the Act. In implementing, enforcing and revising this rule and in delegating authority hereunder, the Administrator will ensure that there is a rational relationship to the attainment and maintenance of Federal and State ambient air quality standards and the requirements of part C of title I, and that the rule is not used for the purpose of preventing exploration and development of the OCS.
          
          
            § 55.2
            Definitions.
            
              Administrator means the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
            
              Corresponding Onshore Area (COA) means, with respect to any existing or proposed OCS source located within 25 miles of a State's seaward boundary, the onshore area that is geographically closest to the source or another onshore area that the Administrator designates as the COA, pursuant to § 55.5 of this part.
            
              Delegated agency means any agency that has been delegated authority to implement and enforce requirements of this part by the Administrator, pursuant to § 55.11 of this part. It can refer to a State agency, a local agency, or an Indian tribe, depending on the delegation status of the program.
            
              Existing source or existing OCS source shall have the meaning given in the applicable requirements incorporated into §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part, except that for two years following the date of promulgation of this part the definition given in § 55.3 of this part shall apply for the purpose of determining the required date of compliance with this part.
            
              Exploratory source or exploratory OCS source means any OCS source that is a temporary operation conducted for the sole purpose of gathering information. This includes an operation conducted during the exploratory phase to determine the characteristics of the reservoir and formation and may involve the extraction of oil and gas.
            
              Modification shall have the meaning given in the applicable requirements incorporated into §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part, except that for two years following the date of promulgation of this part the definition given in section 111(a) of the Act shall apply for the purpose of determining the required date of compliance with this part, as set forth in § 55.3 of this part.
            
              Nearest Onshore Area (NOA) means, with respect to any existing or proposed OCS source, the onshore area that is geographically closest to that source.
            
              New source or new OCS source shall have the meaning given in the applicable requirements of §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part, except that for two years following the date of promulgation of this part, the definition given in § 55.3 of this part shall apply for the purpose of determining the required date of compliance with this part.
            
              OCS source means any equipment, activity, or facility which:
            (1) Emits or has the potential to emit any air pollutant;

            (2) Is regulated or authorized under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”) (43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.); and
            (3) Is located on the OCS or in or on waters above the OCS.
            This definition shall include vessels only when they are:

            (1) Permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed and erected thereon and used for the purpose of exploring, developing or producing resources therefrom, within the meaning of section 4(a)(1) of OCSLA (43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.); or
            (2) Physically attached to an OCS facility, in which case only the stationary sources aspects of the vessels will be regulated.
            
              Onshore area means a coastal area designated as an attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable area by EPA in accordance with section 107 of the Act. If the boundaries of an area designated pursuant to section 107 of the Act do not coincide with the boundaries of a single onshore air pollution control agency, then onshore area shall mean a coastal area defined by the jurisdictional boundaries of an air pollution control agency.
            
              Outer continental shelf shall have the meaning provided by section 2 of the OCSLA (43 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.).
            
              Potential emissions means the maximum emissions of a pollutant from an OCS source operating at its design capacity. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as a limit on the design capacity of the source if the limitation is federally enforceable. Pursuant to section 328 of the Act, emissions from vessels servicing or associated with an OCS source shall be considered direct emissions from such a source while at the source, and while enroute to or from the source when within 25 miles of the source, and shall be included in the “potential to emit” for an OCS source. This definition does not alter or affect the use of this term for any other purposes under §§ 55.13 or 55.14 of this part, except that vessel emissions must be included in the “potential to emit” as used in §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part.
            
              Residual emissions means the difference in emissions from an OCS source if it applies the control requirements(s) imposed pursuant to § 55.13 or § 55,14 of this part and emissions from that source if it applies a substitute control requirement pursuant to an exemption granted under § 55.7 of this part.
            
              State means the State air pollution control agency that would be the permitting authority, a local air pollution permitting agency, or certain Indian tribes which can be the permitting authority for areas within their jurisdiction. State may also be used in the geographic sense to refer to a State, the NOA, or the COA.

The request must be received by the Administrator within 60 days of the receipt of the NOI. If no requests are received by the Administrator within 60 days of the receipt of the NOI, the NOA will become the designated COA without further action.
            (2) No later than 90 days after the receipt of the NOI, a demonstration must be received by the Administrator showing that:
            (i) The area has more stringent requirements with respect to the control and abatement of air pollution than the NOA;
            (ii) The emissions from the source are or would be transported to the requesting area; and
            (iii) The transported emissions would affect the requesting area's efforts to attain or maintain a Federal or State ambient air quality standard or to comply with the requirements of part C of title I of the Act, taking into account the effect of air pollution control requirements that would be imposed if the NOA were designated as the COA.
            (c) Determination by the Administrator. (1) If no demonstrations are received by the Administrator within 90 days of the receipt of the NOI, the NOA will become the designated COA without further action.
            (2) If one or more demonstrations are received, the Administrator will issue a preliminary designation of the COA within 150 days of the receipt of the NOI, which shall be followed by a 30 day public comment period, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
            (3) The Administrator will designate the COA for a specific source within 240 days of the receipt of the NOI.
            (4) When the Administrator designates a more stringent area as the COA with respect to a specific OCS source, the delegated agency in the COA will exercise all delegated authority. If there is no delegated agency in the COA, then EPA will issue the permit and implement and enforce the requirements of this part. The Administrator may retain authority for implementing and enforcing the requirements of this part if the NOA and the COA are in different States.
            (5) The Administrator shall designate the COA for each source only once in the source's lifetime.
            (d) Offset requirements. Offsets shall be obtained based on the applicable requirements of the COA, as set forth in §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part.
            (e) Authority to designate the COA. The authority to designate the COA for any OCS source shall not be delegated to a State or local agency, but shall be retained by the Administrator.
            (f) Administrative procedures and public participation. The Administrator will use the following public notice and comment procedures for processing a request for COA designation under this section:
            (1) Within 150 days from receipt of an NOI, if one or more demonstrations are received, the Administrator shall make a preliminary determination of the COA and shall:
            (i) Make available, in at least one location in the NOA and in the area requesting COA designation, which may be a public Web site identified by the Administrator, a copy of all materials submitted by the requester, a copy of the Administrator's preliminary determination, and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered by the Administrator in making the preliminary determination; and
            (ii) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the NOA and the area requesting COA designation or on a public Web site identified by the Administrator, of a 30-day opportunity for written public comment on the available information and the Administrator's preliminary COA designation.
            (2) A copy of the notice required pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section shall be sent to the requester, the affected source, each person from whom a written request of such notice has been received, and the following officials and agencies having jurisdiction over the COA and NOA: State and local air pollution control agencies, the chief executive of the city and county, the Federal Land Manager of potentially affected Class I areas, and any Indian governing body whose lands may be affected by emissions from the OCS source.
            (3) Public comments received in writing within 30 days after the date the public notice is made available will be considered by the Administrator in making the final decision on the request. All comments will be made available for public inspection.
            (4) The Administrator will make a final COA designation within 60 days after the close of the public comment period. The Administrator will notify, in writing, the requester and each person who has requested notice of the final action and will set forth the reasons for the determination. Such notification will be made available for public inspection.

            (5) Delegation of authority. If the Administrator delegates any of the authority to implement and enforce the requirements of this section, the following provisions shall apply:
            (i) The applicant shall send a copy of any permit application required by this section to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office at the same time as the application is submitted to the delegated agency.
            (ii) The delegated agency shall send a copy of any public comment notice required under this section or §§ 55.13 or 55.14 to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office.
            (iii) The delegated agency shall send a copy of any preliminary determination and final permit action required under this section or §§ 55.13 or 55.14 to the Administrator through the EPA Regional Office at the time of the determination and shall make available to the Administrator any materials used in making the determination.
            (b) Preconstruction requirements for OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries. (1) No OCS source to which the requirements of §§ 55.13 or 55.14 of this part apply shall begin actual construction after the effective date of this part without a permit that requires the OCS source to meet those requirements.
            (2) Any permit application required under this part shall not be submitted until the Administrator has determined whether a consistency update is necessary, pursuant to § 55.12 of this part, and, if the Administrator finds an update to be necessary, has published a proposed consistency update.
            (3) The applicant may be required to obtain more than one preconstruction permit, if necessitated by partial delegation of this part or by the requirements of this section and §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part.
            (4) An approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within 18 months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The 18-month period may be extended upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator or the delegated agency that an extension is justified. Sources obtaining extensions are subject to all new or interim requirements and a reassessment of the applicable control technology when the extension is granted. This requirement shall not supersede a more stringent requirement under §§ 55.13 or 55.14 of this part.
            (5) Any preconstruction permit issued to a new OCS source or modification shall remain in effect until it expires under paragraph (b)(4) of this section or is rescinded under the applicable requirements incorporated in §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part.
            (6) Whenever any proposed OCS source or modification to an existing OCS source is subject to action by a Federal agency that might necessitate preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321), review by the Administrator conducted pursuant to this section shall be coordinated with the environmental reviews under that Act to the extent feasible and reasonable.

            (7) The Administrator or delegated agency and the applicant shall provide written notice of any permit application from a source, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the Federal Land Manager charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands within the Class I area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information contained in the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of receipt of the application and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the preconstruction permit.
            (8) Modification of existing sources. The preconstruction requirements above shall not apply to a particular modification, as defined in § 55.13 or § 55.14 of this part, of an existing OCS source if:
            (i) The modification is necessary to comply with this part, and no other physical change or change in the method of operation is made in conjunction with the modification;
            (ii) The modification is made within 24 months of promulgation of this part; and

            (iii) The modification does not result in an increase, in excess of any de minimis levels contained in the applicable requirements of §§ 55.13 and 55.14, of potential emissions or actual hourly emissions of a pollutant regulated under the Act.
            (9) Compliance plans. Sources intending to perform modifications that meet all of the criteria of paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall submit a compliance plan to the Administrator or delegated agency prior to performing the modification. The compliance shall describe the schedule and method the source will use to comply with the applicable OCS requirements within 24 months of the promulgation date of this part and shall include a request for any exemptions from compliance with a pollution control technology requirement that the applicant believes is technically infeasible or will cause an unreasonable threat to health and safety. The Administrator or delegated agency shall act on the request for exemption in accordance with the procedures established in § 55.7 of this part.
            (i) The Administrator or delegated agency shall review the compliance plan and provide written comments to the source within 45 days of receipt of such plan. The source shall provide a written response to such comments as required by the reviewing agency.
            (ii) Receipt and review of a compliance plan by the Administrator or delegated agency shall not relieve any owner or operator of an existing OCS source of the responsibility to comply fully with the applicable requirements of §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part within 24 months of promulgation of this part.
            (c) Operating permit requirements for sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries. (1) All applicable operating permit requirements listed in this section and incorporated into §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part shall apply to OCS sources.
            (2) The Administrator or delegated agency shall not issue a permit to operate to any existing OCS source that has not demonstrated compliance with all the applicable requirements of this part.
            (3) If the COA does not have an operating permits program approved pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or if EPA has determined that the COA is not adequately implementing an approved program, the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 71, the Federal operating permits program, shall apply to the OCS sources. The applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 71 will be implemented and enforced by the Administrator. The Administrator may delegate the authority to implement and enforce all or part of a Federal operating permits program to a State pursuant to § 55.11 of this part.
            (d) Permit requirements for sources located beyond 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries. (1) OCS sources located beyond 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries shall be subject to the permitting requirements set forth in this section and § 55.13 of this part.
            (2) The Administrator or delegated agency shall not issue a permit-to-operate to any existing OCS source that has not demonstrated compliance with all the applicable requirements of this part.

            (2) A source subject to § 55.6(e) shall comply with the following requirements:
            (i) By October 5, 1992, the owner or operator of the source shall submit a transitional permit application (“TPA”) to the Administrator or the delegated agency. The TPA shall include the following:
            (A) The information specified in §§ 55.4(b)(1) through § 55.4(b)(9) of this part;
            (B) A list of all requirements applicable to the source under this part;
            (C) A request for exemption from compliance with any control technology requirement that the applicant believes is technically infeasible or will cause an unreasonable threat to health and safety;
            (D) An air quality screening analysis demonstrating whether the source has or is expected in the future to cause or contribute to a violation of any applicable State or Federal ambient air quality standard or exceed any applicable increment. If no air quality analysis is required by the applicable requirements of §§ 55.13 and 55.14, this requirement does not apply;
            (E) Documentation that source emissions are currently being offset, or will be offset if the source has not commenced operation, at the ratio required under this part, and documentation that those offsets meet or will meet the requirements of this part; and
            (F) A description of how the source is complying with the applicable requirements of §§ 55.13 and 55.14 of this part, including emission levels and corresponding control measures, including Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”) or Lowest Achievable Emission Rates (“LAER”), but excluding the requirements to have valid permits.
            (ii) The source shall expeditiously complete its permit application in compliance with the schedule determined by the Administrator or delegated agency.

            § 55.7
            Exemptions.
            (a) Authority and criteria. The Administrator or the delegated agency may exempt a source from a control technology requirement of this part if the Administrator or the delegated agency finds that compliance with the control technology requirement is technically infeasible or will cause an unreasonable threat to health and safety.
            (b) Request for an exemption—(1) Permit application required. An applicant shall submit a request for an exemption from a control technology requirement at the same time as the applicant submits a preconstruction or operating permit application to the Administrator or delegated agency.
            
            (2) No permit application required. If no permit or permit modification is required, a request for an exemption must be received by the Administrator or delegated agency within 60 days from the date the control technology requirement is promulgated by EPA.
            (3) Compliance plan. An existing source that submits a compliance plan in accordance with § 55.6(b) of this part shall submit all requests for exemptions at the same time as the compliance plan. For the purpose of applying § 55.7 of this part, a request submitted with a compliance plan shall be treated in the same manner as a request that does not require a permit application.
            (4) Content of request. (i) The request shall include information that demonstrates that compliance with a control technology requirement of this part would be technically infeasible or would cause an unreasonable threat to health and safety.
            (ii) The request shall include a proposed substitute requirement(s) as close in stringency to the original requirement as possible.
            (iii) The request shall include an estimate of emission reductions that would be achieved by compliance with the original requirement, an estimate of emission reductions that would be achieved by compliance with the proposed substitute requirement(s) and an estimate of residual emissions.
            (iv) The request shall identify emission reductions of a sufficient quantity to offset the estimated residual emissions. Sources located beyond 25 miles from States' seaward boundaries shall consult with the Administrator to identify suitable emission reductions.
            (c) Consultation requirement. If the authority to grant or deny exemptions has been delegated, the delegated agency shall consult with the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether the exemption will be granted or denied.
            (1) The delegated agency shall transmit to the Administrator (through the Regional Office), the Minerals Management Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard, a copy of the permit application, or the request if no permit is required, within 5 days of its receipt.
            (2) Consensus. If the delegated agency, the Minerals Management Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard reach a consensus decision on the request within 90 days from the date the delegated agency received the request, the delegated agency may issue a preliminary determination in accordance with the applicable requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
            (3) No consensus. If the delegated agency, the Minerals Management Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard do not reach a consensus decision within 90 days from the date the delegated agency received the request, the request shall automatically be referred to the Administrator who will process the referral in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The delegated agency shall transmit to the Administrator, within 91 days of its receipt, the request and all materials submitted with the request, such as the permit application or the compliance plan, and any other information considered or developed during the consultation process.
            (4) If a request is referred to the Administrator and the delegated agency issues a preliminary determination on a permit application before the Administrator issues a final decision on the exemption, the delegated agency shall include a notice of the opportunity to comment on the Administrator's preliminary determination in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
            (5) The Administrator's final decision on a request that has been referred pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall be incorporated into the final permit issued by the delegated agency. If no permit is required, the Administrator's final decision on the request shall be implemented and enforced by the delegated agency.
            (d) Preliminary determination. The Administrator or delegated agency shall issue a preliminary determination in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. A preliminary determination shall propose to grant or deny the request for exemption. A preliminary determination to grant the request shall include proposed substitute control requirements and offsets necessary to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
            (e) Grant of exemption. (1) The source shall comply with a substitute requirement(s), equal to or as close in stringency to the original requirement as possible, as determined by the Administrator or delegated agency.
            (2) An OCS source located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries shall offset residual emissions resulting from the grant of an exemption request in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the regulations thereunder. The source shall obtain offsets in accordance with the applicable requirements as follows:
            (i) If offsets are required in the COA, a new source shall offset residual emissions in the same manner as all other new source emissions in accordance with the requirements of § 55.5(d) of this part.
            (ii) If offsets are not required in the COA, a new source shall comply with an offset ratio of 1:1.
            (iii) An existing OCS source shall comply with an offset at a ratio of 1:1.
            (3) An OCS source located beyond 25 miles from States' seaward boundaries shall obtain emission reductions at a ratio determined by the Administrator to be adequate to protect State and Federal ambient air quality standards and to comply with part C of title I of the Act.
            (f) Administrative procedures and public participation—(1) Request submitted with a permit application. If a request is submitted with a permit application, the request shall be considered part of the permit application and shall be processed accordingly for the purpose of administrative procedures and public notice and comment requirements. The Administrator shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 124 and the requirements set forth at § 55.6 of this part. If the Administrator has delegated authority to a State, the delegated agency shall use its own procedures as deemed adequate by the Administrator in accordance with § 55.11 of this part. These procedures must provide for public notice and comment on the preliminary determination.
            (2) Request submitted without a permit or with a compliance plan. If a permit is not required, the Administrator or the delegated agency shall issue a preliminary determination within 90 days from the date the request was received, and shall use the procedures set forth at paragraph (f)(4) of this section for processing a request.
            (3) Referral. If a request is referred to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator shall make a preliminary determination no later than 30 days after receipt of the request and any accompanying materials transmitted by the delegated agency. The Administrator shall use the procedures set forth at paragraph (f)(4) of this section for processing a request.
            (4) The Administrator or the delegated agency shall comply with the following requirements for processing requests submitted without a permit, with a compliance plan, and requests referred to the Administrator:
            (i) Issue a preliminary determination to grant or deny the request. A preliminary determination by the Administrator to deny a request shall be considered a final decision and will be accompanied by the reasons for the decision. As such, it is not subject to any further public notice, comment, or hearings. Written notice of the denial shall be given to the requester.
            (ii) Make available, in at least one location in the COA and NOA, which may be a public Web site identified by the Administrator or delegated agency, a copy of all materials submitted by the requester, a copy of the preliminary determination, and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered in making the preliminary determination.
            (iii) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the COA and NOA or on a public Web site identified by the Administrator or delegated agency, of a 30-day opportunity for written public comment on the information submitted by the owner or operator and on the preliminary determination.

            Fees.
            (a) OCS sources located within 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries. (1) The EPA will calculate and collect operating permit fees from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 71.

            (2) EPA will collect all other fees from OCS sources calculated in accordance with the fee requirements imposed in the COA if the fees are based on regulatory objectives, such as discouraging emissions. If the fee requirements are based on cost recovery objectives, however, EPA will adjust the fees to reflect the costs to EPA to issue permits and administer the permit program.
            (3) Upon delegation, the delegated agency will collect fees from OCS sources calculated in accordance with the fee requirements imposed in the COA. Upon delegation of authority to implement and enforce any portion of this part, EPA will cease to collect fees imposed in conjunction with that portion.
            (b) The OCS sources located beyond 25 miles of States' seaward boundaries. The EPA will calculate and collect operating permit fees from OCS sources in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 71.

            § 55.11
            Delegation.
            (a) The Governor or the Governor's designee of any State adjacent to an OCS source subject to the requirements of this part may submit a request, purusant to section 328(a)(3) of the Act, to the Administrator for the authority to implement and enforce the requirements of this OCS program: Within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary; and/or Beyond 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary. Authority to implement and enforce §§ 55.5, 55.11, and 55.12 of this part will not be delegated.
            (b) The Administrator will delegate implementation and enforcement authority to a State if the State has an adjacent OCS source and the Administrator determines that the State's regulations are adequate, including a demonstration by the State that the State has:
            (1) Adopted the appropriate portions of this part into State law;
            (2) Adequate authority under State law to implement and enforce the requirements of this part. A letter from the State Attorney General shall be required stating that the requesting agency has such authority;
            (3) Adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of this part; and
            (4) Adequate administrative procedures to implement and enforce the requirements of this part, including public notice and comment procedures.
            (c) The Administrator will notify in writing the Governor or the Governor's designee of the Administrator's final action on a request for delegation within 6 months of the receipt of the request.
            (d) If the Administrator finds that the State regulations are adequate, the Administrator will authorize the State to implement and enforce the OCS requirements under State law. If the Administrator finds that only part of the State regulations are adequate, he will authorize the State to implement and enforce only that portion of this part.
            (e) Upon delegation, a State may use any authority it possesses under State law to enforce any permit condition or any other requirement of this part for which the agency has delegated authority under this part. A State may use any authority it possesses under State law to require monitoring and reporting and to conduct inspections.
            (f) Nothing in this part shall prohibit the Administrator from enforcing any requirement of this part.
            (g) The Administrator will withdraw a delegation of any authority to implement and enforce any or all of this part if the Administrator determines that: (1) The requirements of this part are not being adequately implemented or enforced by the delegated agency, or (2) The delegated agency no longer has adequate regulations as required by § 55.11(b) of this part.
            (h) Sharing of information. Any information obtained or used in the administration of a delegated program shall be made available to EPA upon request without restriction. If the information has been submitted to the delegated agency under a claim of confidentiality, the delegated agency must notify the source of this obligation and submit that claim to EPA. Any information obtained from a delegated agency accompanied by a claim of confidentiality will be treated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 2.
            (i) Grant of exemptions. A decision by a delegated agency to grant or deny an exemption request may be appealed to the Administrator in accordance with § 55.7 of this part.
            (j) Delegated authority. The delegated agency in the COA for sources located within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary or the delegated agency in the NOA for sources located beyond 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary will exercise all delegated authority. If there is no delegated agency in the COA for sources located within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, or in the NOA for sources located beyond 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, the EPA will issue the permit and implement and enforce the requirements of this part. For sources located within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, the Administrator may retain the authority for implementing and enforcing the requirements of this part if the NOA and COA are in different States.

            § 55.12
            Consistency updates.
            (a) The Administrator will update this part as necessary to maintain consistency with the regulations of onshore areas in order to attain and maintain Federal and State ambient standards and comply with part C of title I of the Act.
            (b) Where an OCS activity is occurring within 25 miles of a State seaward boundary, consistency reviews will occur at least annually. In addition, in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, consistency reviews will occur upon receipt of an NOI and when a State or local agency submits a rule to EPA to be considered for incorporation by reference in this part 55.
            (1) Upon initiation of a consistency review, the Administrator will evaluate the requirements of part 55 to determine whether they are consistent with the current onshore requirements.
            (2) If the Administrator finds that part 55 is inconsistent with the requirements in effect in the onshore area, EPA will conduct a notice and comment rulemaking to update part 55 accordingly.
            (c) Consistency reviews triggered by receipt of an NOI. Upon receipt of an NOI, the Administrator will initiate a consistency review of regulations in the onshore area.

            (1) If the NOI is submitted by a source for which the COA has previously been assigned, EPA will publish a proposed consistency update in the Federal Register no later than 60 days after the receipt of the NOI, if an update is deemed necessary by the Administrator:

            (2) If the NOI is submitted by a source requiring a COA designation, EPA will publish a proposed consistency update in the Federal Register, if an update is deemed necessary by the Administrator:
            (i) No later than 75 days after receipt of the NOI if no adjacent areas submit a request for COA designation and the NOA becomes the COA by default, or
            (ii) No later than 105 days after receipt of the NOI if an adjacent area submits a request to be designated as COA but fails to submit the required demonstration within 90 days of receipt of the NOI, or
            (iii) No later than 15 days after the date of the final COA determination if one or more demonstrations are received.
            (d) Consistency reviews triggered by State and local air pollution control agencies submitting rules directly to EPA for inclusion into part 55. (1) EPA will propose in the Federal Register to approve applicable rules submitted by State or local regulatory agencies for incorporation by reference into § 55.14 of this part by the end of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the submittal is received by EPA.
            (2) State and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 must be rationally related to the attainment and maintenance of Federal or State ambient air quality standards or to the requirements of part C of title I of the Act. The submittal must be legible and unmarked, with the adoption date and the name of the agency on each page, and must be accompanied by proof of adoption.
            (e) No rule or regulation that EPA finds to be arbitrary or capricious will be incorporated into this part.
            (f) A source may not submit a complete permit application until any update the Administrator deems necessary to make part 55 consistent with the COA's rules has been proposed.

            (3) Nothing in this section shall alter or limit EPA's authority to administer or enforce the requirements of this part under Federal law.
            (4) EPA shall not be bound by any State or local administrative or procedural requirements including, but not limited to, requirements pertaining to hearing boards, permit issuance, public notice procedures, and public hearings.

            § 56.2
            Scope.
            This part covers actions taken by:
            (a) Employees in EPA Regional Offices, including Regional Administrators, in carrying out powers and duties delegated by the Administrator under section 301(a)(1) of the act; and
            (b) EPA employees in Headquarters to the extent that they are responsible for developing the procedures to be employed or policies to be followed by Regional Offices in implementing and enforcing the act.
          
          
            § 56.3
            Policy.
            It is EPA's policy to:
            (a) Assure fair and uniform application by all Regional Offices of the criteria, procedures, and policies employed in implementing and enforcing the act;
            (b) Provide mechanisms for identifying and correcting inconsistencies by standardizing criteria, procedures, and policies being employed by Regional Office employees in implementing and enforcing the act; and
            (c) Insure an adequate quality audit for each State's performance in implementing and enforcing the act.

            (d) Recognize that only the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court that arise from challenges to “nationally applicable regulations . . . or final action,” as discussed in Clean Air Act section 307(b) (42 U.S.C. 7607(b)), shall apply uniformly, and to provide for exceptions to the general policy stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section with regard to decisions of the federal courts that arise from challenges to “locally or regionally applicable” actions, as provided in Clean Air Act section 307(b) (42 U.S.C. 7607(b)).

            (a) The Administrator shall include, as necessary, with any rule or regulation proposed or promulgated under parts 51 and 58 of this chapter 1
               mechanisms to assure that the rule or regulation is implemented and enforced fairly and uniformly by the Regional Offices.
            
              
                1 Part 51 is entitled, “Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans.” Part 58 is entitled, “Ambient Air Quality Surveillance.”
            
            (b) The determination that a mechanism required under paragraph (a) of this section is unnecessary for a rule or regulation shall be explained in writing by the responsible EPA official and included in the supporting documentation or the relevant docket.
            (c) The Administrator shall not be required to issue new mechanisms or revise existing mechanisms developed under paragraphs (a) of this section to address the inconsistent application of any rule, regulation, or policy that may arise in response to the limited jurisdiction of either a federal circuit court decision arising from challenges to “locally or regionally applicable” actions, as provided in Clean Air Act section 307(b) (42 U.S.C. 7607(b)), or a federal district court decision.

            § 56.5
            Mechanisms for fairness and uniformity—Responsibilities of Regional Office employees.
            (a) Each responsible official in a Regional Office, including the Regional Administrator, shall assure that actions taken under the act:
            (1) Are carried out fairly and in a manner that is consistent with the Act and Agency policy as set forth in the Agency rules and program directives,
            (2) Are as consistent as reasonably possible with the activities of other Regional Offices, and
            (3) Comply with the mechanisms developed under § 56.4 of this part.
            (b) A responsible official in a Regional office shall seek concurrence from the appropriate EPA Headquarters office on any interpretation of the Act, or rule, regulation, or program directive when such interpretation may result in application of the act or rule, regulation, or program directive that is inconsistent with Agency policy. However, the responsible official in a Regional office will not be required to seek such concurrence from the appropriate EPA Headquarters office for actions that may result in inconsistent application if such inconsistent application is required in order to act in accordance with a federal court decision:
            (1) Issued by a Circuit Court in challenges to “locally or regionally applicable” actions, as provided in Clean Air Act section 307(b) (42 U.S.C. 7607(b)), if that circuit court has direct jurisdiction over the geographic areas that the Regional office official is addressing, or (2) Issued by a district court in a specific case if the party the Regional office official is addressing was also a party in the case that resulted in the decision.
            (c) In reviewing State Implementation Plans, the Regional Office shall follow the provisions of the guideline, revisions to State Implementation Plans—Procedures for Approval/Disapproval Actions, OAQPS No. 1.2-005A, or revision thereof. Where regulatory actions may involve inconsistent application of the requirements of the act, the Regional Offices shall classify such actions as special actions.

            § 56.6
            Dissemination of policy and guidance.

            The Assistant Administrators of the Offices of Air, Noise and Radiation, and of Enforcement, and the General Counsel shall establish as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than one year after promulgation of this part, systems to disseminate policy and guidance. They shall distribute material under foregoing systems to the Regional Offices and State and local agencies, and shall make the material available to the public. Air programs policy and guideline systems shall contain the following:
            (a) Compilations of relevant EPA program directives and guidance, except for rules and regulations, concerning the requirements under the Act.
            (b) Procedures whereby each Headquarters program office and staff office will enter new and revised guidance into the compilations and cause superseded guidance to be removed.
            (c) Additional guidance aids such as videotape presentations, workshops, manuals, or combinations of these where the responsible Headquarters official determines they are necessary to inform Regional Offices, State and local agencies, or the public about EPA actions.
          
          
            § 56.7
            State agency performance audits.
            (a) EPA will utilize the provisions of subpart B, Program Grants, of part 35 of this chapter, which require yearly evaluations of the manner in which grantees use Federal monies, to assure that an adequate evaluation of each State's performance in implementing and enforcing the act is performed.

            (b) Within 60 days after comment is due from each State grantee on the evaluation report required by § 35.538 of this chapter, the Regional Administrator shall incorporate or include any comments, as appropriate, and publish notice of availability of the evaluation report in the Federal Register.

            Subpart A—General
            
              § 57.101
              Purpose and scope.
              (a) Applicability of the regulations. The regulations in subparts A through H govern:
              (1) The eligibility of smelters for a Primary Nonferrous Smelter Order (NSO) under section 119 of the Clean Air Act;
              (2) The procedures through which an NSO can be approved or issued by EPA; and

              (3) The minimum contents of each NSO required for EPA issuance or approval under section 119. Subpart I et seq., will contain NSOs in effect for individual smelters.
              (b) State authority to adopt more stringent requirements. Nothing in this part shall preclude a State from imposing more stringent requirements, as provided by section 116 of the Clean Air Act.
            
            
              § 57.102
              Eligibility.
              (a) A primary copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, or other nonferrous smelter is eligible for an NSO if it meets the following conditions:
              (1) The smelter was in existence and operating on August 7, 1977;

              (2) The smelter is subject to an approved or promulgated sulfur dioxide (SO2) State Implementation Plan (SIP) emission limitation which is adequate to ensure that National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO2 are achieved without the use of any unauthorized dispersion techniques; and

              (3) The Administrator determines, based on a showing by the smelter owner, that no means of emission limitation applicable to the smelter which would enable it to comply with its SIP stack emission limitation for SO2 has been adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available (taking into account the cost of compliance, nonair quality health and environmental impact, and energy considerations) in accordance with § 57.201(d)(1).
              (b) For the purposes of these regulations:
              (1) The following means of emission limitation shall be considered adequately demonstrated for nonferrous smelters. (Taking into account nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy considerations, but not the cost of compliance).
              (i) Retrofit control technologies. (A) Sulfuric acid plant in conjunction with an adequately demonstrated replacement technology or process modification;
              (B) Magnesium oxide (concentration) scrubbing;
              (C) Lime/limestone scrubbing; and
              (D) Ammonia scrubbing.
              (ii) Replacement or process modifications. (A) Flash smelting;
              (B) Oxygen enrichment;
              (C) Supplemental sulfur burning in conjunction with acid plant;
              (D) Electric Furnace;
              (E) Noranda process;
              (F) Fluid bed roaster;
              
              (G) Continuous smelting (Mitsubishi) process; and
              (H) Strong stream/weak stream gas blending.

              (2) Each adequately demonstrated means of emission limitation which would enable a smelter to comply with its SIP emission limitation for SO2 shall be considered applicable to the smelter unless the smelter operator demonstrates that the use of a particular system at that smelter is technically unreasonable, for reasons specific to that site.

              (3) An applicable means of emission limitation which would enable a smelter to comply with its SIP emission limitation for SO2 shall be considered adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available to the smelter (taking into account the cost of compliance) if the information submitted under §§ 57.107(a) and 57.203(b) (plus any necessary supplemental information) shows, according to the criteria, procedures, and tests contained in appendix A to this part and in accordance with § 57.201(d)(1), that both of the following two tests are met.
              (i) The rate of return test. The present value of the smelter's future net cash flow (during and after investment in constant control technology) is more than book value of the smelter's net investment in constant dollars.
              (ii) The profit protection test. The constant control technology expenditure reduces the present value of the smelter's forecast pretax profits by less than 50%.
              (c) When applying for an NSO, a smelter must establish, for purposes of applying the financial eligibility tests, which adequately demonstrated constant control technology applicable to that smelter is the most economically feasible for use at that smelter.

              [50 FR 6448, Feb. 15, 1985, as amended at 57 FR 5328, Feb. 13, 1992]
            
            
              § 57.104
              Amendment of the NSO.
              An NSO shall be amended whenever necessary for compliance with the requirements and purposes of this part.
              (a)(1) Issuance of amendment. A State or local issuing agency may issue an amendment of any NSO it has issued. Any amendment issued by a State or local issuing agency shall be subject to approval by EPA to the same extent as was the original NSO. Any smelter owner may apply to the agency which originally issued its NSO for an amendment of the NSO at any time. Such an application shall be accompanied by whatever documentation is required by that agency (or EPA) to support the requested amendment.
              (2)(i) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, amendments to SIP compliance schedule interim compliance dates in State-issued NSO's need not be submitted for EPA approval if the amendment does not delay the interim date by more than three months from the date as approved by the Administrator and if the final compliance date is unchanged. Delays longer than 3 months shall be handled according to the provisions of § 57.104(a)(1).

              (ii) Changes made in accordance with this subparagraph may be effective immediately but must be submitted to EPA within seven days. EPA will give public notice of receipt of such changes by publication of a Notice in the Federal Register.
              
              (3) In any case in which the issuing agency fails to issue an amendment necessary for compliance with the requirements and purposes of this part, EPA may, after first giving the issuing Agency notice, issue such amendment.
              (b) Revision of SCS Manual. Operation in accordance with the revised provisions of an SCS operational manual (see § 57.402(e)) shall not be considered a violation of an NSO while the application for approval of those revisions as NSO amendments is pending before the issuing agency (or EPA) for approval: Provided, that:
              (1) No violations of NAAQS occur in the smelter's Designated Liability Area during that time; and
              (2) The smelter operator has not been informed by the issuing agency or EPA that its application is not adequately documented, unless such deficiency has been remedied promptly.
              (c) Notice and opportunity for hearing. Notice and opportunity for public hearing shall be provided before issuance of all major amendments.
            
            
              § 57.105
              Submittal of required plans, proposals, and reports.
              (a) The failure of a smelter owner to submit any plan, report, document or proposal as required by its NSO or by this part shall constitute a violation of its NSO.
              (b) If the Administrator determines that a nonferrous smelter is in violation of a requirement contained in an NSO approved under these regulations, the Administrator shall, as provided by section 119(f) of the Act:
              (1) Enforce such requirement under section 113 (a), (b), or (c) of the Act;
              (2) Revoke the order after notice and opportunity for hearing;
              (3) Give notice of noncompliance and commence action under section 120 of the act; or
              (4) Take any appropriate combinations of these actions.
              (c) Under section 304 of the Act, any person may commence a civil action against an owner or operator of a smelter which is alleged to be in violation or any order approved under this part.
            
            
              § 57.106

              § 57.107
              The State or local agency's transmittal to EPA.
              (a) Content and bases of the State or local agency's NSO. Issuance of an NSO by a State or local agency shall be completed by the issuing agency's transmittal to the appropriate EPA Regional Office of:
              (1) The text of the NSO;
              (2) The application submitted by the smelter owner, except for appendix A to this part, all correspondence between the issuing agency and the applicant relating to the NSO, and any material submitted in support of the application;
              (3) A concise statement of the State or local agency's findings and their bases; and
              (4) All documentation or analyses prepared by or for the issuing agency in support of the NSO.
              (b) The State or local agency's enforcement plan. The transmittal under paragraph (a) of this section shall be accompanied by a description of the issuing agency's plans for monitoring compliance with and enforcement of the NSO. The transmittal shall also include a description of the resources which will be used to implement those plans. If the enforcement plans appear inadequate, EPA may require that the NSO be modified such that the NSO will be adequately enforced.
            
            
              § 57.108
              Comparable existing SIP provisions.

              Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an NSO may contain provisions to which the affected smelter is subject under the applicable EPA-approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide in lieu of the corresponding provisions which would otherwise be required under this part if the Administrator determines that those SIP provisions are substantially equivalent to the corresponding NSO provisions which would otherwise be required, and if the Administrator determines that the smelter is in substantial compliance with those SIP provisions. For the purposes of this section, provisions to which the affected smelter is subject under the applicable EPA-approved State Implementation Plan are those which became effective before the smelter owner applied for the NSO.
            
            
              § 57.109
              Maintenance of pay.
              The Administrator will not approve or issue an NSO for any smelter unless he has approved or promulgated SIP provisions which are applicable to the smelter and which satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(6) of the Clean Air Act.
            
            
              § 57.110
              Reimbursement of State or local agency.
              As a condition of issuing an NSO, any issuing agency may require the smelter operator to pay a fee to the State or local agency sufficient to defray the issuing agency's expenses in issuing and enforcing the NSO.
            
            
              § 57.111
              Severability of provisions.
              The provisions promulgated in this part and the various applications thereof are distinct and severable. If any provision of this part or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions, or the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances, which can be given effect without the invalid provision of application.
            
          
          
            Subpart B—The Application and the NSO Process
            
              § 57.201
              Where to apply.
              Any eligible smelter may apply for an NSO to the appropriate EPA Regional Office or to the appropriate State or local air pollution control agency.
              (a) When application is made to EPA, all parts of the application required to be submitted under this subpart shall be sent directly to the Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Confidential Information Unit. In addition, the smelter owner shall send a copy of the application, except that part required to be submitted under § 57.203(b) (eligibility), directly to the appropriate EPA Regional Office.
              (b) When application is made to the appropriate State or local agency, the smelter owner shall submit one complete copy of all parts of the application required to be submitted under this subpart to that agency, in addition to the application requirements contained in paragraph (a) of this section. If the smelter owner is requesting an advance eligibility determination pursuant to § 57.203(b), such request must be made in writing and shall accompany the copy of the application being sent to the Director of the Stationary Source Compliance Division of the Environmental Protection Agency.
              (c) If the smelter owner is requesting a waiver of the interim constant control requirement of § 57.301, such request must be sent directly to the Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division, at the time of application, in accordance with § 57.802.
              (d) The NSO Process. (1) A smelter desiring an NSO shall apply for an NSO by submitting an application under subpart B including the financial information required in appendix A and including the information necessary to make the determinations required by this subparagraph and § 57.201(d)(2). The issuing agency shall analyze the financial information according to the financial eligibility test prescribed by subpart A and described in appendix A. The issuing Agency shall then determine whether the smelter is able to comply with its SIP on or before the date required in the SIP by installing adequately demonstrated technology which is reasonably available. See also § 57.102(a)(3). If the test demonstrates that adequately demonstrated technology is not reasonably available to the smelter to allow it to comply with the SIP by the required compliance date, the smelter is eligible for an NSO.

              (2)(i) If the smelter is determined to be eligible for an NSO under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the issuing Agency shall apply the appendix A financial eligibility tests again before issuing an NSO in order to determine if the smelter can comply with its SIP requirements on or before January 1, 1988 by installing adequately demonstrated technology which is reasonably available.

              (ii) If application of the tests shows that the smelter could comply by or before January 1, 1988, the issuing agency shall notify the smelter of this determination, and shall not issue an NSO to the smelter unless the NSO contains a SIP compliance schedule meeting the requirements of § 57.705. Such a compliance schedule must provide for compliance with the smelter's SO2 SIP as expeditiously as practicable and in no case later than January 1, 1988. A smelter must submit to the issuing agency information necessary to determine a compliance schedule meeting the requirements of § 57.705. This information shall be submitted by a smelter within thirty days after the smelter is notified by the issuing agency that a SIP compliance schedule is required. The Administrator may consider an NSO application to be withdrawn for SIP enforcement purposes if a smelter fails to submit such information within the time required under this paragraph.
              (iii) If no adequately demonstrated technology is found to be reasonably available to enable a smelter to comply by January 1, 1988, it would be excused from the compliance schedule requirement in § 57.201(d)(2)(ii), but it would be subject to reevaluation of its ability to comply by that date at any time during the term of the NSO. (See § 57.201(d)(3)).
              (3) At any time during the term of an NSO which does not contain a SIP compliance schedule, EPA or the issuing agency may reevaluate the availability of technology to the smelter. If EPA or the issuing agency determines that adequately demonstrated technology is reasonably available to permit the smelter to comply with its SIP by or before January 1, 1988, the NSO shall be amended within 3 months time after such determination. The amendment shall require compliance with all SIP requirements by or before January 1, 1988, and shall include a compliance schedule meeting the requirements of § 57.705. The determination that adequately demonstrated technology is reasonably available shall be made by reapplying the same appendix A financial eligibility tests required by subpart B, updated by economic data reflecting current operating conditions and currently demonstrated control technology. Any such determination and amendment shall be governed by the provisions of this part and section 119 of the Clean Air Act.
              (4) Notice and opportunity for public hearing in accordance with section 119 of the Clean Air Act must be provided before issuance of any NSO.
              (e) A smelter that does not have any constant SO2 controls or whose existing constant SO2 controls when in full operation and optimally maintained are not sufficient to treat all strong SO2 streams may apply for a waiver of the requirements of subpart C to install interim constant controls by submitting an application under subpart H. A waiver may be granted only with respect to the requirement to eliminate bypass of constant controls through the installation of new constant control equipment, not with respect to the requirements for optimum maintenance and operation of existing equipment. EPA shall then determine the smelter's ability to afford installation of the required additional interim constant SO2 control equipment at the smelter based on financial eligibility information analyzed according to the financial test prescribed in appendix A. A waiver of the requirement for additional interim constant controls will be granted if EPA determines in accordance with the procedures of subpart H that imposition of this requirement would necessitate closure of the smelter for at least one year.
            
            
              § 57.202
              How to apply.
              (a) Letter of intent. To initiate an application for an NSO, the owner or operator of a smelter shall send a letter of intent to an appropriate air pollution control agency. The letter of intent shall contain a statement of the owner's intent to apply for an NSO, and an agreement to provide any information required under this part. The letter of intent shall be signed by a corporate official authorized to make such commitments. Upon receipt of any letter of intent by the issuing agency, the SIP emission limitation for sulfur dioxide, as to that applicant, shall be deemed suspended for 60 days. The 60 day suspension may be extended for good cause at the discretion of the Administrator.
              (b) Complete application. (1) Within the period referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the smelter owner shall submit its completed application pursuant to § 57.201. Receipt of all parts of a substantially complete application postmarked within the original or extended application period shall be deemed to continue the suspension of the SIP emission limitation for SO2 until the issuing agency issues or declines to issue an NSO. This suspension shall in all cases terminate, however, 90 days after receipt of the substantially completed application, unless extended for good cause at the discretion of the Administrator. If, in the Administrator's judgment, good faith effort has been made to submit a complete application, additional time may be granted to allow for correction of minor deficiencies.
              (2) If an issuing agency transmits an NSO to EPA for approval before the expiration of the suspension of the Federal SIP emission limitation, the suspension shall continue until EPA approves or disapproves the NSO.
            
            
              § 57.203
              Contents of the application.

              (3) The optimal conversion efficiency (defined in terms of percent of total SO2 removed from the input flow stream) of any acid plant or other sulfur dioxide control system under the normal process operating conditions (excluding malfunctions) most conducive to optimal conversion efficiency;
              (4) The average conversion efficiency of any acid plant or other sulfur dioxide control system during normal process operations (excluding malfunctions), by month, during the past four years.

              (5) The percent of the time the acid plant or other control system was available for service during each month for the past four years, excluding downtime for scheduled maintenance, and a full explanation of any major or recurring problems with the system during that time;

              (6) The frequency and duration of times during the past four years when the SO2 system was unavailable because of scheduled maintenance of the system;
              (7) A description of all scheduled, periodic, shutdowns of the smelter during the past four years, including their purpose, frequency and duration; and the same information with respect to unscheduled shutdowns;
              (8) The gas volume, rates, and SO2 concentration which the control system was actually designed to accommodate, taking into account any modifications made after its installation;
              (9) The average monthly sulfur balance across the process and control equipment, including fugitive emissions, for the past 4 years; and
              (10) A description of engineering techniques now in use at the smelter to prevent the release of fugitive emissions into the atmosphere at low elevations.
              (d) The smelter owner's proposals. The smelter owner shall submit as part of its application, draft NSO provisions which would implement the requirements of subparts C through G of this part. The issuing agency may use these proposals as the basis for any NSO that may be granted, or may modify these proposals in any way it deems necessary in order to comply with the requirements of this part.
              (e) A smelter may submit as part of its application, information necessary to determine any SIP compliance schedule which might be required under § 57.201(d)(2).
              (f) Additional information. The smelter owner shall designate in its application a corporate officer responsible and authorized to supply supplemental technical and economic information and explanations as required by the issuing agency during the formulation of the NSO. Failure to supply such information and explanations shall constitute a failure to submit a complete application.
              (g) Request for a waiver of constant controls. Any request for a waiver of the requirement interim constant control of all strpmg streams of § 57.301 shall be made in accordance with § 57.802. The criteria and procedures for granting the waiver are governed by subpart H of this part.
              (h) Unless a smelter applies for a waiver in accordance with subpart H, a smelter shall submit as part of its application a proposed schedule for compliance with the interim constant control requirements of subpart C which satisfies the requirements of § 57.702.
            
            
              § 57.204
              EPA action on second period NSOs which have already been issued.

              (a) EPA may approve a second period NSO issued by a State before the date of publication of these regulations in the Federal Register, without requiring a complete reapplication under this subpart and new State proceedings, provided:
              (1) The second period NSO was issued by the State consistent with the procedural requirements of section 119 of the Clean Air Act;

              (2) EPA can make a determination that the smelter is eligible for a second period NSO and whether the smelter can comply with its SO2 SIP limits on or before January 1, 1988 under the financial eligibility tests in these regulations on the basis of available information and such supplementary information as the Agency may request the smelter to submit; and
              (3) The provisions of the NSO are consistent with the requirements of these regulations.
              (b) Should EPA require a smelter to submit information before taking final action on an NSO referred to in paragraph (a), of this section, it shall specify a reasonable period for submission of such information in light of the nature of the information being required. The duration of such period shall not exceed the period allowed for submission of a complete application under § 57.202 (a) and (b).

              (c) The Agency shall consider the SIP emission limitation for SO2 to be suspended with respect to a smelter which received an NSO described in subpart A until EPA takes final action on such NSO. Such suspension shall terminate if the smelter does not submit supplementary information within the time specified under paragraph (b).
            
            
              
              § 57.205
              Submission of supplementary information upon relaxation of an SO2 SIP emission limitation.
              (a) In the event an SO2 SIP limit is relaxed subsequent to EPA approval or issuance of a second period NSO, the smelter issued the NSO shall submit to the issuing agency and EPA such supplementary information that EPA considers appropriate for purposes of determining whether the means of compliance with the new SIP limit are adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available under the financial eligibility tests specified in § 57.102(b)(3). The smelter shall submit such information within sixty days of notification by EPA. This time limit may be extended by EPA for good cause.

              (b) Upon receipt of any supplementary information required under paragraph (a), the issuing agency shall promptly reevaluate the availability of the means of compliance with the new SIP limit under the NSO eligibility tests specified in § 57.102(b)(3). If the issuing agency determines that the demonstrated control technology necessary to attain the new SO2 SIP limit is adequately demonstrated to be reasonably available under the eligibility tests, so as to permit the smelter to comply with the new SIP limit on or before January 1, 1988, the NSO shall be amended within the time contemplated by § 57.202(a) after receipt of the supplementary information. Such amendment shall require compliance with the new SO2 SIP limit as expeditiously as practicable in accordance with § 57.201(d)(3). The issuing agency, if not EPA, shall promptly submit its determination and any necessary NSO amendments to EPA.
              (c) EPA shall take action to approve or disapprove the issuing agency's determination and NSO amendment, if any, within a reasonable time after receipt of such determination and amendment.
              (d) If EPA disapproves the issuing agency's determination or NSO amendment, or if a smelter fails to submit any supplementary information as required under paragraph (a), EPA and/or the issuing agency shall take appropriate remedial action. EPA shall take appropriate remedial action if the issuing agency does not make any determination and amendment required by this section within the time contemplated by § 57.202(a).
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Constant Controls and Related Requirements
            
              § 57.301
              General requirements.
              Each NSO shall require an interim level of sulfur dioxide constant controls to be operated at the smelter, unless a waiver of this requirement has been granted to the owner under subpart H of this part. Except as otherwise provided in § 57.304, the interim constant controls shall be properly operated and maintained at all times. The NSO shall require the following gas streams to be treated by interim constant controls:
              (a) In copper smelters, off-gases from fluidized bed roasters, flash furnaces, NORANDA reactors, electric furnaces and copper converters;
              (b) In lead smelters, off-gases from the front end of the sintering machine and any other sinter gases which are recirculated;
              (c) In zinc smelters, off-gases from mult-hearth roasters, flash roasters and fluidized bed roasters; and

              (d) In all primary nonferrous smelters, all other strong SO2 streams.
              (e) In all primary nonferrous smelters, any other process streams which were regularly or intermittently treated by constant controls at the smelter as of August 7, 1977.
            
            
              § 57.302
              Performance level of interim constant controls.
              (a) Maximum feasible efficiency. Each NSO shall require: that the smelter operate its interim constant control systems at their maximum feasible efficiency, including the making of any improvements necessary to correct the effects of any serious deficiencies; that the process and control equipment be maintained in the way best designed to ensure such operation; and that process operations be scheduled and coordinated to facilitate treatment of process gas streams to the maximum possible extent. Maximum feasible efficiency shall be expressed in the NSO in the form of a limitation on the concentration of SO2 in the tail gas of each individual control system in combination with an appropriate averaging period, as provided below in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
              (b) The limitation level for SO
                2
                concentration in the control system tail gas. The level at which the concentration limitation is set shall take into account fluctuations in the strength and volume of process off-gases to the extent that those fluctuations affect the SO2 content of the tail gas and cannot be avoided by improved scheduling and coordination of process operations. The limitation shall exclude the effect of any increase in emissions caused by process or control equipment malfunction. The limitation shall take into account unavoidable catalyst deterioration in sulfuric acid plants, but may prescribe the frequency of catalyst screening or replacement. The NSO shall also prohibit the smelter owner from using dilution air to meet the limitation.
              (c) Averaging period. (1) The averaging period shall be derived in combination with the concentration limitation and shall take into account the same factors described in paragraph (b). The averaging period established under this paragraph should generally not exceed the following:
              (i) For sulfuric acid plants on copper smelters, 12-hour running average;
              (ii) For sulfuric acid plants on lead smelters, 6-hour running average;
              (iii) For sulfuric acid plants on zinc smelters, 2-hour running average;
              (iv) For dimethylaniline (DMA) scrubbing units on copper smelters, 2-hour running average.
              (2) A different averaging period may be established if the applicant demonstrates that such a period is necessary in order to account for the factors described in paragraph (b) of this section: Provided, that the period is enforceable and satisfies the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section.
              (d) Improved performance. (1) The performance level representing maximum feasible efficiency for any existing control system (e.g., a sulfuric acid plant or a DMA scrubber) shall require the correction of the effects of any serious deficiencies in the system. For the purpose of this paragraph, at least the following problems shall constitute serious deficiencies in acid plants:
              (i) Heat exchangers and associated equipment inadequate to sustain efficient, autothermal operation at the average gas strengths and volumes received by the acid plant during routine process equipment operation;
              (ii) Failure to completely fill all available catalyst bed stages with sufficient catalyst;
              (iii) Inability of the gas pre-treatment system to prevent unduly frequent plugging or fouling (deterioration) of catalyst or other components of the acid plant; or
              (iv) Blower capacity inadequate to permit the treatment of the full volume of gas which the plant could otherwise accommodate, or in-leakage of air into the flues leading to the plant, to the extent that this inadequacy results in bypassing of gas around the plant.
              (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of § 57.304(c) (malfunction demonstration), no excess emissions (as defined in § 57.304(a)) shall be considered to have resulted from a malfunction in the constant control system if the smelter owner has not upgraded serious deficiencies in the constant control system in compliance with the requirements of § 57.302(d)(1), unless the smelter owner demonstrates under § 57.304(c) that compliance with those requirements would not have affected the magnitude of the emission.
              (e) Multiple control devices. (1) At any smelter where off-gas streams are treated by various existing control systems (e.g., multiple acid plants or a DMA scrubber and an acid plant), the NSO shall require the use of those systems in the combination that will result in the maximum feasible net SO2 removal.
              (2) To the extent that compliance with this requirement is demonstrated by the smelter operator to result in excess emissions during unavoidable start up and shut down of the control systems, those excess emissions shall not constitute violations of the NSO.
            
            
              § 57.303
              Total plantwide emission limitation.
              (a) Calculation of the emission limitation. Each NSO shall contain a requirement limiting the total allowable emissions from the smelter to the level which would have been associated with production at the smelter's maximum production capacity (as defined in § 57.103(r)) as of August 7, 1977. This limitation shall be expressed in units of mass per time and shall be calculated as the sum of uncontrolled process and fugitive emissions, and emissions from any control systems (operating at the efficiency prescribed under § 57.302). These emission rates may be derived from either direct measurements or appropriately documented mass balance calculations.
              (b) Compliance with the emission limitation. Each NSO shall require the use of specific, enforceable testing methods and measurement periods for determining compliance with the limitation established under paragraph (a) of this section.
            
            
              § 57.304
              Bypass, excess emissions and malfunctions.
              (a) Definition of excess emissions. For the purposes of this subpart, any emissions greater than those permitted by the NSO provisions established under § 57.302 (performance level of interim constant controls) or § 57.303 (plantwide emission limitation) of this subpart shall constitute excess emissions. Emission of any gas stream identified under § 57.301 (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this subpart that is not treated by a sulfur dioxide constant control system shall also constitute an excess emission under this subpart.
              (b) The excess emission report. Each NSO shall require the smelter to report all excess emissions to the issuing agency, as provided in § 57.305(b). The report shall include the following:
              (1) Identity of the stack or other emission points where the excess emissions occurred;
              (2) Magnitude of the excess emissions expressed in the units of each applicable emission limitation, as well as the operating data, documents, and calculations used in determining the magnitude of the excess emissions;
              (3) Time and duration of the excess emissions;
              (4) Identity of the equipment causing the excess emissions;
              (5) Nature and cause of such excess emissions;
              (6) Steps taken to limit the excess emissions, and when those steps were commenced;
              (7) If the excess emissions were the result of a malfunction, the steps taken to remedy the malfunction and to prevent the recurrence of such malfunction; and
              (8) At the smelter owner's election, the demonstration specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Malfunction demonstration. Except as provided in § 57.302(e)(2) or in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, any excess emission shall be a violation of the NSO unless the owner demonstrates in the excess emissions report required under paragraph (b) of this section that the excess emission resulted from a malfunction (or an unavoidable start up and shut down resulting from a malfunction) and that:
              (1) The air pollution control systems, process equipment, or processes were at all times maintained and operated, to the maximum extent practicable, in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions;
              (2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as practicable, including the use of off-shift labor and overtime;
              (3) The amount and duration of the excess emissions were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and
              (4) The excess emissions were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of serious deficiencies in, or inadequate operation, design, or maintenance of, the process or control equipment.
              (d) Scheduled maintenance exception. Excess emissions occurring during scheduled maintenance shall not constitute violations of the NSO to the extent that:

              (1) The expected additional annual sulfur dioxide removal by any control system (including associated process changes) for which construction had not commenced (as defined in 40 CFR 60.2 (g) and (i)) as of August 7, 1977 and which the smelter owner agrees to install and operate under subpart F, would have offset such excess emissions if the system had been in operation throughout the year in which the maintenance was performed;
              
              (2) The system is installed and operated as provided in the NSO provisions established under subpart F; and
              (3) The system performs at substantially the expected efficiency and reliability subsequent to its initial break-in period.

              (e) An NSO may provide that excess emissions which occur during acid plant start-up as the result of the cooling of acid plant catalyst due to the unavailability of process gas to an acid plant during a prolonged SCS curtailment or scheduled maintenance are not excess emissions. If the NSO does so provide, it shall also require the use of techniques or practices designed to minimize these excess emissions, such as the sealing of the acid plant during prolonged curtailments, the use of auxiliary heat or SO2 injected during the curtailment, or the preheating of the acid plant before start-up of the process equipment it serves.
              (f) Requirements for a smelter with constant controls that applies for a waiver.
              (1) If a smelter that has some interim constant controls applies for a waiver in accordance with subpart H, the following requirements shall apply pending action on the waiver application and following final action granting or approving a waiver:
              (i) The NSO shall require the smelter to implement maintenance and operation measures designed to reduce to the maximum extent feasible the potential for bypass of existing interim constant controls.
              (ii) Upon application for a waiver under subpart H, the smelter shall submit to the issuing agency for its approval and to EPA proposed maintenance and operation measures for compliance with the requirements of paragraph (i).
              (iii) The remainder of this subpart shall apply except that: (A) The emission limitations required under this subpart shall be based only on existing constant control equipment as upgraded through the improved maintenance and operation required by this paragraph, and (B) bypass of existing controls shall not constitute excess emissions, provided the maintenance and operation requirements and emission limitations prescribed by the NSO are satisfied.
              (2) After any denial of a waiver by the issuing Agency, or any disapproval by EPA of a waiver granted by the issuing agency, the NSO shall be amended consistent with the requirements of this subpart and § 57.702.
            
            
              § 57.305
              Compliance monitoring and reporting.
              (a) Monitoring. (1) Each NSO shall require compliance with the control system performance requirements established pursuant to this subpart to be determined through the use of continuous monitors for measuring SO2 concentration.

              (i) Such monitors must be installed, operated and maintained in accordance with the performance specifications and other requirements contained in appendix D to 40 CFR part 52 or part 60. The monitors must take and record at least one measurement of SO2 concentration from the effluent of each control system in each 15-minute period. Failure of the monitors to record at least 95% of the 15-minute periods in any 30-day period shall constitute a violation of the NSO.
              (ii) The sampling point shall be located at least 8 stack diameters (diameter measured at sampling point) downstream and 2 diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, constriction, or flame, unless another location is approved by the Administrator.
              (iii) The sampling point for monitoring emissions shall be in the duct at the centroid of the cross section if the cross sectional area is less than 4.645m2 (50 ft2) or at a point no closer to the wall than 0.914m (3 ft) if the cross sectional area is 4.645m2 (50 ft2) or more. The monitor sample point shall be in an area of small spatial concentration gradient and shall be representative of the concentration in the duct.

              (iv) The measurement system(s) installed and used pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the manufacturer's recommended zero adjustment and calibration procedures at least once per 24-hour operating period unless the manufacturer specifies or recommends calibration at shorter intervals, in which case such specifications or recommendations shall be followed. Records of these procedures shall be made which clearly show instrument readings before and after zero adjustment and calibration.

              (2) Each NSO shall require the monitoring of any ducts or flues used to bypass gases, required under this subpart to be treated by constant controls, around the smelter's sulfur dioxide constant control system(s) for ultimate discharge to the atmosphere. Such monitoring shall be adequate to disclose the time of the bypass, its duration, and the approximate volume and SO2 concentration of gas bypassed.
              (b) Reporting. (1) Each NSO shall require that the smelter maintain a record of all measurements required under paragraph (a) of this section. Results shall be summarized monthly and shall be submitted to the issuing agency within 15 days after the end of each month. The smelter owner shall retain a record of such measurements for one year after the NSO period terminates.
              (2) Each NSO shall require that the smelter maintain a record of all measurements and calculations required under § 57.303(b). Results shall be summarized on a monthly basis and shall be submitted to the issuing agency at 6-month intervals. The smelter owner shall retain a record of such measurements and calculations for at least one year after the NSO terminates.
              (3) The report required under § 57.304(b) shall accompany the report required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
              (c) Quality assurance and continuous data—(1) Quality assurance. Each NSO shall require that the smelter submit a plan for quality assurance to the issuing agency for approval and that all monitoring performed by continuous monitors shall be verified for quality assurance by the smelter. Such plans must follow current EPA guidelines for quality assurance, in order to be approvable.
              (2) Continuous data. Manual source testing methods equivalent to 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used to determine compliance if the continuous monitoring system malfunctions.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Supplementary Control System Requirements
            
              § 57.401
              General requirements.
              Except as provided in subpart E, each NSO shall require the smelter owner to prevent all violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's designated liability area (DLA) through the operation of an approved supplementary control system (SCS).
            
            
              § 57.402
              Elements of the supplementary control system.
              Each supplementary control system shall contain the following elements:
              (a) Air quality monitoring network. An approvable SCS shall include the use of appropriate ambient air quality monitors to continuously measure the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air in the smelter's DLA.

              (1) The monitors shall be located at all points of expected SO2 concentrations necessary to anticipate and prevent possible violations of NAAQS anywhere in the smelter's DLA. The determination of the locations where such concentrations may occur shall take into account all recorded or probable meteorological and operating conditions (including bypassing of control equipment), as well as the presence of other sources of SO2 significantly affecting SO2 concentrations in the DLA.

              (2) The number and location of sites shall be based on dispersion modeling, measured ambient air quality data, meteorological information, and the results of the continuing review required by paragraph (f) of this section. The system shall include the use of at least 7 fixed monitors unless the issuing agency determines, on the basis of a demonstration by the smelter owner, that the use of fewer monitors would not limit coverage of points of high SO2 concentration or otherwise reduce the capability of the smelter owner to prevent any violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA.

              (3) All monitors shall be continuously operated and maintained and shall meet the performance specifications contained in 40 CFR part 53. The monitors shall be capable of routine real time measurement of maximum expected SO2 concentrations for the averaging times of SO2 NAAQS.
              
              (b) Meteorological network. The SCS must have a meteorological assessment capability adequate to predict and identify local conditions requiring emission curtailment to prevent possible violations of the NAAQS. The meteorological assessment capability shall provide all forecast and current information necessary for successful use of the SCS operational manual required by paragraph (e) of this section.
              (c) Designated liability area. The system shall be required to prevent all violations of the NAAQS within the smelter's DLA. The DLA of any smelter is the area within which the smelter's emissions may cause or significantly contribute to violations of the NAAQS for SO2 when the smelter is operating at its maximum production capacity under any recorded or probable meterological conditions. The boundaries of that area shall be specified in the NSO.
              (1) Unless an acceptable demonstration is made under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the DLA shall be a circle with a center point at the smelter's tallest stack and a minimum radius as given in the following table:
              
                Radius for SO2 Emissions at Maximum Production Capacity 1
                
                
                  Emissions rate in tons per hour
                  Emission rate in grains per sec.

                  1 Maximum emission rates for periods not to exceed 24 hours. Minimum radii may be determined from the table by linear interpolation.
              
              (2) The NSO may provide for a DLA with different boundaries if the smelter owner can demonstrate through the use of appropriate dispersion modeling and ambient air quality monitoring data that the smelter's controlled emissions could not cause or significantly contribute to a violation of the NAAQS beyond the boundaries of such a different area under any recorded or probable meteorological conditions.
              (3) A violation of the NAAQS in the DLA of any smelter shall constitute a violation of that smelter's NSO, unless the issuing agency determines on the basis of a showing by the smelter owner that the smelter owner had taken all emission curtailment action indicated by the SCS operational manual and that the violation was caused in significant part by:
              (i) Emissions of another source(s) which were in excess of the maximum permissible emissions applicable to such source(s),
              (ii) Fugitive emissions of another source(s), or
              (iii) The smelter's own fugitive emissions: Provided, that the smelter is in compliance with all requirements of or under subpart E of this part.
              (4) For the purposes of this section, maximum permissible emissions for other sources are the highest of:
              (i) SIP emission limitation;
              (ii) Orders in effect under section 113(d) of the Clean Air Act; or
              (d) Overlapping designated liability areas. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, the following requirements shall apply whenever the designated liability areas of 2 or more smelters do, or may, overlap:
              (1) In the case of any NSO applicant that would have a DLA which would overlap with the DLA of any other smelter that has applied for an NSO or has an NSO in effect, the NSO applicant shall include in its application an enforceable joint plan, agreed to by such other smelter(s). In determining whether a joint plan is required, the NSO applicant shall calculate its DLA according to the table in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The DLA of the other smelter shall be calculated according to the table in paragraph (c)(1) unless the other smelter has an NSO in effect, in which case the boundaries in that NSO shall be used. The enforceable joint plan shall provide for:
              (i) Emission curtailment adequate to ensure that the NAAQS will not be violated in any areas of overlapping DLAs; and
              (ii) Conclusive prospective allocation of legal liability in the event that the NAAQS are violated in the area of overlapping DLAs.

              Such plans may, but need not, include the operation of a joint SCS system. Each NSO shall require adherence by the NSO applicant owner to the joint plan for emission curtailment and allocation of liability, unless the issuing agency determines, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, that the NSO applicant's DLA does not overlap with that of any other smelter.
              (2) In the case of any NSO applicant that would have a DLA which would overlap with the DLA of any other smelter whose owner has not applied for an NSO (and does not have an NSO in effect), the NSO applicant's submittal shall contain a written consent, signed by a corporate official empowered to do so. The consent shall state that if, at any time thereafter, the owner of the other smelter applies for an NSO, and the other smelter's DLA would overlap with the NSO applicant's DLA, the NSO applicant will negotiate and submit an enforceable joint plan for emission curtailment and allocation of liability (as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section). In determining whether it is necessary to submit such a consent, each smelter's DLA shall be calculated according to the table set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The consent shall state that a joint plan shall be submitted within 90 days of the issuing agency's notification to the NSO applicant of receipt of the other smelter's letter of intent, unless the issuing agency determines that the DLAs do not overlap. Failure of the NSO applicant to submit such a plan shall constitute grounds for denial of its NSO application or a violation of an effective NSO, as applicable.
              (e) The SCS operational manual. Each NSO shall require the smelter to be operated in accordance with the provisions of an SCS operational manual approved by the issuing agency. The SCS operational manual shall describe the circumstances under which, the extent to which, and the procedures through which emissions shall be curtailed to prevent violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA. Failure to curtail emissions when and as much as indicated by the manual or to follow the provisions of the manual implementing the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section shall constitute a violation of the NSO.
              (1) The operational manual shall prescribe emission curtailment decisions based on the use of real time information from the air quality monitoring network dispersion model estimates of the effect of emissions on air quality, and meteorological observations and predictions.
              (2) The operational manual shall also provide for emission curtailment to prevent violation of the NAAQS within the smelter's DLA which may be caused in part by stack emissions, and to the extent practicable fugitive emissions, from any other source (unless that other source is a smelter subject to an NSO).
              (3) The SCS operational manual shall include (but not be limited to):
              (i) A clear delineation of the authority of the SCS operator to require all other smelter personnel to implement the operator's curtailment decisions;
              (ii) The maintenance and calibration procedures and schedules for all SCS equipment;
              (iii) A description of the procedures to be followed for the regular acquisition of all meteorological information necessary to operate the system;
              (iv) The ambient concentrations and meteorological conditions that will be used as criteria for determining the need for various degrees of emission curtailment;
              (v) The meteorological variables as to which judgments may be made in applying the criteria stated pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section;
              (vi) The procedures through which and the maximum time period within which a curtailment decision will be made and implemented by the SCS operator;
              (vii) The method for immediately evaluating the adequacy of a particular curtailment decision, including the factors to be considered in that evaluation;
              (viii) The procedures through which and the time within which additional necessary curtailment will immediately be effected; and
              (ix) The procedures to be followed to protect the NAAQS in the event of a mechanical failure in any element of the SCS.
              (f) Continuing review and improvement of the SCS. Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to conduct an active program to continuously review the design and operation of the SCS to determine what measures may be available for improving the performance of the system. Among the elements of this program shall be measures to locate and examine possible places both inside and outside the DLA where unmonitored NAAQS violations may be occurring. Such measures shall include the use of modeling as appropriate and mobile ambient air quality monitors, following up on information and complaints from members of the public, and other appropriate activities. The NSO shall also require the submission of a semi-annual report to the issuing agency detailing the results of this review and specifying measures implemented to prevent the recurrence of any violations of NAAQS.
            
            
              § 57.403
              Written consent.
              (a) The consent. The NSO shall include a written consent, signed by a corporate official empowered to do so, in the following form:
              
              
                As a condition of receiving a Primary Nonferrous Smelter Order (NSO) under Section 119 of the Clean Air Act, for the smelter operated by (name of company) at (location), the undersigned official, being empowered to do so, consents for the company as follows:
                (1) In any civil proceeding (judicial or administrative) to enforce the NSO, the company will not contest:
                (a) Liability for any violation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for sulfur dioxide in the smelter's designated liability area (DLA), except on the ground that a determination under 40 CFR 57.402(c)(3) was clearly wrong; or
                (b) The conclusive allocation of liability under NSO provisions satisfying 40 CFR 57.402(d)(1) between the company's smelter and any other smelter(s) for any violation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for sulfur dioxide in an area of overlapping DLAs.
                (2) The issuing agency (as defined in 40 CFR 57.103) will be allowed unrestricted access at reasonable times to inspect, verify calibration of, and obtain data from ambient air quality monitors operated by the company under the requirements of the NSO.
              
              
              (b) Rights not waived by the consent. This consent shall not be deemed to waive any right(s) to judicial review of any provisions of an NSO that are otherwise available to the smelter owner or operator under section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act.
            
            
              § 57.404
              Measurements, records, and reports.
              (a) Measurements. Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to install, operate, and maintain a measurement system(s) for continuously monitoring sulfur dioxide emissions and stack gas volumetric flow rates in each stack (except a stack used exclusively for bypassing control equipment) which could emit 5 percent or more of the smelter's total potential (uncontrolled) hourly sulfur dioxide emissions.
              (1) Such monitors shall be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the performance specifications and other requirements contained in appendices D and E to 40 CFR part 52. The monitors must take and record at least one measurement of sulfur dioxide concentration and stack gas flow rate from the effluent of each affected stack in each fifteen-minute period. (The NSO shall require the smelter operator to devise and implement any procedures necessary for compliance with these performance specifications.)
              (2) The sampling point shall be located at least eight stack diameters (diameter measured at sampling point) downstream and two diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, constriction, or flame, unless another location is approved by the Administrator.
              (3) The sampling point for monitoring emissions shall be in the duct at the centroid of the cross section if the cross sectional area is less than 4.645 m2 (50 ft 2) or at a point no closer to the wall than 0.914m (3 ft) if the cross sectional area is 4.645 m2 (50 ft2) or more. The monitor sample point shall be in an area of small spatial concentration gradient and shall provide a sample which is representative of the concentration in the duct.

              (4) The measurement system(s) installed and used pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the manufacturer's recommended zero adjustment and calibration procedures at least once per 24-hour operating period unless the manufacturer specifies or recommends calibration at shorter intervals, in which case such specifications or recommendations shall be followed. Records of these procedures shall be made which clearly show instrument readings before and after zero adjustment and calibration.
              (5) The results of such monitoring, calibration, and maintenance shall be submitted in the form and with the frequency specified in the NSO.
              (b) Records. Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to maintain records of the air quality measurements made, meteorological information acquired, emission curtailment ordered (including the identity of the persons making such decisions), and calibration and maintenance performed on SCS monitors during the operation of the SCS. These records shall be maintained for the duration of the NSO.
              (c) Reports. Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to:

              (1) Submit a monthly summary indicating all places and times at which the NAAQS for SO2 were violated in the smelter's DLA, and stating the SO2 concentrations at such times;

              (2) Immediately notify EPA and the State agency any time concentrations of SO2 in the ambient air in the smelter's DLA reaches 0.3 part per million (800 micrograms/cubic meter), 24-hour average, or exceed the warning stage in any more stringent emergency plan in the applicable State Implementation Plan; and
              (3) Make such other reports as may be specified in the NSO.
            
            
              § 57.405
              Formulation, approval, and implementation of requirements.
              (a) SCS content of the application. The requirements of § 57.203(d) shall be satisfied with respect to this subpart as follows:
              (1) Each NSO application shall include a complete description of any supplementary control system in operation at the smelter at the time of application and a copy of any SCS operational manual in use with that system.
              (2) Each NSO application shall contain proposed NSO provisions for compliance with the requirements of §§ 57.401, 57.402 (c), (d), and (f), 57.403, 57.404, and 57.405 (b)(2).
              (3) Each NSO application shall include a specific plan for the development of a system fulfilling the requirements of § 57.402(a), (b), and (e) (covering air quality monitoring network, meteorological network, and the SCS operational manual).
              (b) SCS content of the order. (1) Each NSO shall include an approved version of the plan described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and shall provide increments of progress towards its completion. Each NSO shall require, upon completion of the measures specified in the approved plan, submission of a report which describes each element of the SCS and explains why the elements satisfy the requirements of the plan and submission of a copy of the SCS operational manual developed under the plan.
              (2) Each NSO shall require the submission of a final report, within 6 months of the required date for completion of the measures specified in the approved plan evaluating the performance and adequacy of the SCS developed pursuant to the approved plan. The report shall include:
              (i) A detailed description of how the criteria that form the basis for particular curtailment decisions were derived;
              (ii) A complete description of each SCS element listed in § 57.402 (a) through (d) (covering monitoring, meteorology, and the DLA), and an explanation of why the elements fulfill the requirements of those sections;

              (iii) A reliability study demonstrating that the SCS will prevent violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA at all times. The reliability study shall include a comprehensive analysis of the system's operation during one or more three-month seasonal periods when meteorological conditions creating the most serious risk of NAAQS violations are likely to occur. Where it is impossible, because of time restraints, to include in such a study and analysis of the three month seasonal period with meteorological conditions creating the most serious risk of NAAQS violations, the study shall analyze the system's operation on the basis of all available information. The NSO shall provide that in such case, a supplemental reliability study shall be submitted after the end of the worst case three-month period as a part of the next semi-annual report required under § 57.402(f).
              (iv) A copy of the current SCS operational manual.
              (c) Amendment of the NSO. Each NSO shall be amended, if necessary, within 3 months of completion of the measures required under the SCS development plan and also, if necessary, within three months of submission of the final report or any supplement to the final report required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, to reflect the most current approved elements of the SCS and, as appropriate, to fulfill all other requirements of this subpart. Each NSO shall also be subsequently amended (as provided in § 57.104) whenever necessary as a result of the program required by § 57.402(f) or to reflect improved SCS operating procedures or other system requirements.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Fugitive Emission Evaluation and Control
            
              § 57.501
              General requirements.

              (a) Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to use such control measures as may be necessary to ensure that the smelter's fugitive emissions do not result in violations of the NAAQS for SO2 in the smelter's DLA.
              (b) A smelter which is operating under an NSO containing a SIP compliance schedule established in accordance with § 57.705 is required to be making progress toward compliance with any fugitive control requirements contained in its respective SIP and need not meet the other requirements contained in this subpart.
              (c) A smelter which is subject to an NSO which does not contain a SIP compliance schedule must meet the provisions of §§ 57.502 and 57.503.
            
            
              § 57.502
              Evaluation.
              (a) Evaluation at the time of application. Any smelter owner may demonstrate at the time of application for an NSO that the smelter's SO2 fugitive emissions will not cause or significant contribute to violations of the NAAQS in the smelter's DLA. If such demonstration is not made, the smelter owner shall submit the design and workplan for a study adequate to assess the sources of significant fugitive emissions from the smelter and their effects upon ambient air quality.
              (b) Evaluation during the first 6 months of the NSO. The design and workplan of the study shall be approved, if adequate, by the issuing agency and included in the NSO. The study shall commence no later than the date when the NSO becomes effective and an analysis of its results shall be submitted to the issuing agency within 6 months of the effective date of the NSO. The study shall include an appropriate period during which the ambient air shall be monitored to determine the impact of fugitive emissions of sulfur dioxide, arsenic (at copper smelters only), lead (at lead and zinc smelters only), and total suspended particulates on the ambient air quality in the smelter's DLA.
            
            
              § 57.503
              Control measures.
              The NSO of any smelter subject to the requirements of § 57.502(b) shall be amended, if necessary, within 6 months of EPA's receipt of the analysis specified in § 57.502(b), as provided in § 57.704(c) to implement the requirement of § 57.501. Measures required to be implemented may include:
              (a) Additional supplementary control. The use of the supplementary control system, if the additional use of the system does not interfere with the smelter owner's ability to meet the requirements of subpart D; and
              (b) Engineering and maintenance techniques. The use of engineering and maintenance techniques to detect and prevent leaks and capture and vent fugitive emissions through appropriate stacks. These techniques include but are not limited to:
              (1) For reactors, installation and proper operation of primary hoods;
              (2) For roasters, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all hot calcine transfer points;
              (3) For furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active matte tap holes, matte launders, slag skim bays, and transfer points;

              (4) For converters, installation and proper operation of primary hoods for blowing operations, and where appropriate, secondary hoods for charging and pouring operations;
              
              (5) For sintering machines, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on the sinter bed, all hot sinter ignition points, all concentrate laydown points, and all hot sinter transfer points;
              (6) For blast furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active slag and lead bullion furnace tap holes and transfer points;
              (7) For dross reverberatory furnaces, installation and proper operation of primary hoods on all active charging and discharging points;
              (8) Maintenance of all ducts, flues and stacks in a leak-free condition to the maximum extent possible;
              (9) Maintenance of all process equipment under normal operating conditions in such a fashion that out-leakage of fugitive gases will be prevented to the maximum extent possible;
              (10) Secondary or tertiary hooding on process equipment where necessary; and
              (11) Partial or complete building evacuation as appropriate.
            
            
              § 57.504
              Continuing evaluation of fugitive emission control measures.
              Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to conduct an active program to continuously review the effectiveness of the fugitive emission control measures implemented pursuant to § 57.503 in maintaining the NAAQS and, if such measures are not sufficiently effective, to evaluate what additional measures should be taken to assure that the NAAQS will be maintained with a reasonably degree of reliability. The NSO shall also require submission of a semi-annual report to the issuing Agency detailing the results of this review and evaluation. Such a report may be submitted as part of the report required under § 57.402(f).
            
            
              § 57.505
              Amendments of the NSO.
              An NSO shall be amended within three months of submission of any report required under § 57.504 so as to require additional fugitive emission control measures if such report establishes that such additional measures are necessary to assure that the NAAQS will be maintained with a reasonable degree of reliability.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Research and Development Requirements
            
              § 57.601
              General requirements.
              (a) This subpart is not applicable to NSOs which contain a SIP compliance schedule in accordance with § 57.705.

              (b) The requirements of this subpart may be waived with respect to a smelter if the owner of that smelter submits with its NSO application a written certification by a corporate official authorized to make such a certification that the smelter will either comply with its SO2 SIP limits by January 2, 1988 or close after January 1, 1988 until it can comply with such limits.
              (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b), each NSO shall require the smelter to conduct or participate in a specific research and development program designed to develop more effective means of compliance with the sulfur dioxide control requirements of the applicable State Implementation Plan than presently exist.
            
            
              § 57.602
              Approval of proposal.
              (a) The smelter owner's proposal. The smelter owner's NSO application shall include a proposed NSO provision for implementing the requirement of § 57.601, a fully documented supporting analysis of the proposed program, and an evaluation of the consistency of the proposed program with the criteria listed in § 57.603. The application shall also specify:
              (1) The design and substantive elements of the research and development program, including the expected amount of time required for their implementation;
              (2) The annual expected capital, operating, and other costs of each element in the program;
              (3) The smelter's current production processes, pollution control equipment, and emissions which are likely to be affected by the program;
              (4) Potential or expected benefits of the program;
              (5) The basis upon which the results of the program will be evaluated; and

              (6) The names, positions, and qualifications of the individuals responsible for conducting and supervising the project.
              
              (b) EPA approval. (1) If the issuing agency will not be EPA, the smelter owner or the issuing agency may also submit to EPA the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section at the same time the information is submitted to the issuing agency. As soon as possible after the receipt of the information described in paragraph (a) of this section, EPA shall certify to the issuing agency and to the applicant whether or not in the judgment of the Administrator the smelter owner's final proposals are approvable. If EPA does not receive an advance copy of the proposal, the ultimate approval will occur when the NSO is approved rather than in advance of receipt of the NSO.
              (2) A prerequisite for approval of an R&D proposal by EPA and any issuing agency is that the planned work must yield the most cost effective technology possible.
              (c) Optional preproposal. The smelter owner may, at its option, submit to EPA for its approval and comment a preproposal generally describing the project the owner intends to propose under paragraph (a) of this section. A preproposal may be submitted to EPA any time prior to the submission of a proposal under paragraph (a) of this section. As soon as possible after the receipt of a preproposal, EPA shall certify to the applicant (and to any other issuing agency, as applicable) whether or not the project would be approvable. This certification may include comments indicating necessary modifications which would make the project approvable.
            
            
              § 57.603
              Criteria for approval.
              The approvability of any proposed research and development program shall be judged primarily according to the following criteria:
              (a) The likelihood that the project will result in the use of more effective means of emission limitation by the smelter within a reasonable period of time and that the technology can be implemented at the smelter in question, should the smelter be placed on a SIP compliance schedule at some future date when adequately demonstrated technology is reasonably available;
              (b) Whether the proposed funding and staffing of the project appear adequate for its successful completion;
              (c) Whether the proposed level of funding for the project is consistent with the research and development expenditure levels for pollution control found in other industries;
              (d) The potential that the project may yield industrywide pollution control benefits;
              (e) Whether the project may also improve control of other pollutants of both occupational and environmental significance;
              (f) The potential effects of the project on energy conservation; and
              (g) Other non-air quality health and environmental considerations.
            
            
              § 57.604
              Evaluation of projects.
              The research and development proposal shall include a provision for the employment of a qualified independent engineering firm to prepare written reports at least annually which evaluate each completed significant stage of the research and development program, including all relevant information and data generated by the program. All reports required by this paragraph shall be submitted to EPA and also to the issuing agency if it is not EPA.
            
            
              § 57.605
              Consent.
              Each NSO shall incorporate by reference a binding written consent, signed by a corporate official empowered to do so, requiring the smelter owner to:
              (a) Carry out the approved research and development program;
              (b) Grant each issuing agency and EPA and their contractors access to any information or data employed or generated in the research and development program, including any process, emissions, or financial records which such agency determines are needed to evaluate the technical or economic merits of the program;
              (c) Grant physical access to representatives and contractors of each issuing agency to each facility at which such research is conducted;

              (d) Grant the representatives and contractors of EPA and the issuing agency reasonable access to the persons conducting the program on behalf of the smelter owner for discussions of progress, interpretation of data and results, and any other similar purposes as deemed necessary by EPA or any issuing agency.
            
            
              § 57.606
              Confidentiality.

            Subpart G—Compliance Schedule Requirements
            
              § 57.701
              General requirements.
              This section applies to all smelters applying for an NSO. Each NSO shall require the smelter owner to meet all of the requirements within the NSO as expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than the deadlines contained in this subpart or any other section of these regulations. For requirements not immediately effective, the NSO shall provide increments of progress and a schedule for compliance. Each schedule must reflect the extent to which any required equipment or systems are already in place and the extent to which any required reports or studies have already been completed. Requirements for smelters to submit compliance schedules and the procedures which they must follow are outlined below.
            
            
              § 57.702
              Compliance with constant control emission limitation.
              (a) This section applies to all smelters which receive an NSO, but only to the extent this section is compatible with any SIP compliance schedule required by §§ 57.201(d)(2) and 57.705.
              (b) Any NSO issued to a smelter not required to immediately comply with the requirements of subpart G under § 57.701 shall contain a schedule for compliance with those requirements as expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than 6 months from the effective date of the NSO, except as follows: Where a waiver is requested in accordance with subpart H, an NSO may be issued without a schedule for compliance with the requirements for which a waiver is being considered consistent with subpart H, pending a final decision on the request under subpart H. If a waiver is requested in accordance with subpart H, compliance with the requirements of subpart C which were deferred as a result of such request shall be achieved as expeditiously as practicable after, but in no case later than 6 months from a final decision by the issuing agency to deny a waiver under subpart H or disapproval by EPA of a waiver granted by the issuing agency. The time limits specified herein may be extended only if a smelter operator demonstrates that special circumstances warrant more time, in which case the compliance schedule shall require compliance as expeditiously as practicable. An NSO which does not contain a schedule for compliance with all the requirements of subpart C because a waiver has been requested in accordance with subpart H shall be amended in accordance with § 57.104 within three months after a final decision under subpart H so as to either grant a waiver of any remaining requirements of subpart C, or deny such a waiver and place the smelter on a compliance schedule for meeting those requirements. If the issuing agency grants a waiver and such waiver is disapproved by EPA, the issuing agency shall promptly amend the NSO so as to place the smelter on a compliance schedule meeting any remaining requirements of subpart C.
              (c) Any schedule required under this section shall contain the following information and increments of progress to the extent applicable:
              (1) Description of the overall design of the SO2 control system(s) to be installed;

              (2) Descriptions of specific process hardware to be used in achieving compliance with interim SO2 constant controls including gas capacity values;
              (3) The date by which contracts will be let or purchase orders issued to accomplish any necessary performance improvements;
              (4) The date for initiating on-site construction or installation of necessary equipment;

              (5) The date by which on-site construction or installation of equipment is to be completed; and
              
              (6) The date for achievement of final compliance with interim emission limitations.
            
            
              § 57.703
              Compliance with the supplementary control system requirements.
              This section applies to all nonferrous smelters applying for an NSO.
              (a) Schedules for smelters with existing SCS. Each NSO shall require immediately upon issuance of the NSO operation of any existing supplementary control system and immediately upon the effective date of the NSO the assumption of liability for all violations of the NAAQS detected by any monitor in the SCS system. Each NSO shall require that within six months of the effective date of the NSO the smelter complete any measures specified in the smelter's approved SCS development plan not implemented at the time the NSO is issued, and assume liability for all violations of the NAAQS detected anywhere in the DLA (except as provided in subpart D of these regulations). Other requirements of subpart D such as the requirements for submission of reports records, and for ongoing evaluation of the SCS shall be complied with at the times specified in subpart D and § 57.701.
              (b) Compliance schedule for smelters with no existing SCS system. Where a smelter has no SCS at the time of issuance of the NSO, the NSO shall require compliance with the requirements of subpart D according to the following schedule:
              (1) Within six months after the effective date of the NSO the smelter shall install all operating elements of the SCS system, begin operating the system, complete all other measures specified in its approved SCS development plan, begin compliance with the requirements of § 57.404, and assume liability for any violations of the NAAQS within its designated liability area (except as provided by subpart D), detected by the SCS monitors in place.
              (2) Within nine months thereafter the smelter shall submit the SCS Report, assume liability for all violations of the NAAQS detected anywhere within its designated liability area, and comply with all other requirements of subpart D, except for those which subpart D specifies are to be satisfied at or after the close of such nine-month period, including requirements for submission of studies, reports, and records, and the requirements for continued review and evaluation of the SCS.
            
            
              § 57.704
              Compliance with fugitive emission evaluation and control requirements.
              This section applies only to smelters not required to submit SIP Compliance Schedules under § 57.705. Each NSO shall require that smelters satisfy each of the requirements of subpart E as expeditiously as practicable, taking into account the extent to which those requirements have already been satisfied, and in any event, within any deadlines specified below.
              (a) Plan for fugitive emission control. The NSO shall provide that within a reasonable period after the submission of the report on the fugitive emission control study required by § 57.502, but within a period allowing sufficient time for compliance with the requirement of § 57.503 for amendment of the NSO, the smelter owner shall submit to the issuing agency for its approval a proposed fugitive emission control plan, including increments of progress, for compliance with the requirements of §§ 57.501 and 57.503.
              (b) SCS Report. If the fugitive emission control plan submitted under paragraph (a) of this section proposes to meet the requirements of §§ 57.501 and 57.503 through the additional use of a supplementary control system, the plan shall demonstrate that the use of supplementary controls at that smelter to prevent violations of the NAAQS resulting from fugitive emissions is practicable, adequate, reliable, and enforceable. The plan shall contain increments of progress providing for completion of the implementation of each additional measure, and for corresponding compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 57.404, within four months of approval of the plan by the issuing agency. The plan shall also provide that within three months after completion of implementation of those additional measures, the smelter shall fully comply with the requirements of §§ 57.401 and 57.501 (including the assumption of liability for violations of NAAQS within its designated liability area), and shall submit and additional SCS report for the approval of the issuing agency. This additional final report shall correspond to that submitted under § 57.405(b)(2), except that it need not contain the 3-month study described in § 57.405(b)(2)(iii).
              (c) NSO amendment. The amendments of the NSO required under § 57.503 shall be affected by the issuing agency as follows:
              (1) With respect to the additional use of SCS, upon approval or promulgation of the plan submitted under paragraph (a) of this section and upon approval or promulgation of the requirements for the system described in the additional SCS Report under paragraph (b) of this section;
              (2) With respect to the additional use of engineering techniques, upon approval or promulgation of the compliance schedule required by paragraph (a) of this section.

              Contents of SIP Compliance Schedule required by § 57.201(d) (2) and (3).
              This section applies to smelters which are required to submit a SIP Compliance Schedule as discussed below.
              (a) Each SIP Compliance Schedule required by § 57.201(d) (2) and (3) must contain the following elements:
              (1) Description of the overall design of the SO2 control system(s) to be installed;
              (2) Descriptions of specific process hardware to be used in achieving compliance with the SIP emission limitation including gas capacity values;
              (3) The date by which contracts will be let or purchase orders issued to accomplish any necessary performance improvements;
              (4) The date for initiating on-site construction or installation of necessary equipment;
              (5) The date by which on-site construction or installation of equipment is to be completed;
              (6) The date for achievement of final compliance with SIP emission limitations; and
              (7) Any other measures necessary to assure compliance with all SIP requirements as expeditiously as practicable.
              (b) Operations of SCS. Smelters to which § 57.705 is applicable must comply with all elements of § 57.703.
            
          
          
            Subpart H—Waiver of Interim Requirement for Use of Continuous Emission Reduction Technology
            
              § 57.801
              Purpose and scope.
              (a) This subpart shall govern all proceedings for the waiver of the interim requirement that each NSO provide for the use of constant controls.
              (b) In the absence of specific provisions in this subpart, and where appropriate, questions arising at any stage of the proceeding shall be resolved at the discretion of the Presiding Officer or the Administrator, as appropriate.
            
            
              § 57.802
              Request for waiver.
              (a) General. (1) Each smelter owner requesting a waiver shall complete, sign, and submit appendix A (Test for Eligibility for Interim Waiver). Copies of appendix A may be obtained from any EPA Regional Administrator, or from the Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. Claims of confidentiality shall be made as provided in § 57.203.
              (2) The smelter owner shall append to the completed and signed appendix A full copies of all documents, test results, studies, reports, scientific literature and assessments required by appendix A. To the extent that the material consists of generally available published material, the smelter owner may cite to the material in lieu of appending it to appendix A. The smelter owner shall specifically designate those portions of any documents relied upon and the facts or conclusions in appendix A to which they relate.
              (b) Effect of submitting incomplete application. (1) The Administrator, or a person designated by him to review applications for waivers, may advise the smelter owner in writing whenever he determines that additional information is needed in order to make the waiver eligibility determinations required by section 119(d)(2) of the Act. The smelter owner shall promptly supply such information. All additional information requested under this paragraph and filed in the manner required by paragraph (d) shall be deemed part of appendix A.
              (2) Failure to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section shall be grounds for denial of the requested waiver.
              (c) Time for requesting waivers. Any request for a waiver must be submitted to the Administrator by the smelter owner at the time of the application for an NSO from the State or the Administrator, as the case may be. Where a smelter was issued a second period NSO by a State before these regulations went into effect, a request for a waiver shall be made and a completed appendix A shall be submitted, within sixty days of the effective date of these regulations, unless an extension is granted by the Administrator, or his designee, for good cause.
              (d) Submission of request. A copy of appendix A (plus attachments) which has been completed for the purpose of requesting a waiver of constant control requirements shall be filed with the Administrator, addressed as follows: Director, Stationary Source Compliance Division (EN-341), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, Attn: Confidential Information Unit.
              (e) Eligibility. A smelter shall be eligible for consideration under this subpart only if it establishes that (1) its existing strong stream controls, if any, lack the capacity while in full operation to treat all strong stream sulfur dioxide emissions and (2) bypass of strong stream controls due to excess strong stream sulfur dioxide emissions cannot be avoided with improved operation and maintenance of existing strong stream controls and process equipment.
              (f) Criteria for decision. The Administrator shall grant or approve a waiver, whichever is appropriate, for any eligible smelter as to which he finds, in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in appendix A, that:
              (1) The higher of the two net present values of future cash flows completed under the two alternative sets of assumptions set forth in the instructions to schedule D.6 in appendix A in less than liquidation (salvage) value; or
              (2) The smelter's average variable costs at all relevant levels of production (after installation of interim constant control equipment) would exceed the weighted average price of smelter output for one year or more.
            
            
              § 57.803
              Issuance of tentative determination; notice.
              (a) Tentative determination. (1) The EPA staff shall formulate and prepare:
              (i) A “Staff Computational Analysis,” using the financial information submitted by the smelter owner under § 57.802 to evaluate the economic circumstances of the smelter for which the waiver is sought;
              (ii) A tentative determination as to whether an interim requirement for the use of constant controls would be so costly as to necessitate permanent or prolonged temporary cessation of operations at the smelter for which the waiver is requested. The tentative determination shall contain a “Proposed Report and Findings” summarizing the conclusions reached in the Staff Computational Analysis, discussing the estimated cost of interim controls, and assessing the effect upon the smelter of requiring those controls. The tentative determination shall also contain a proposed recommendation that the waiver be granted or denied, based upon the Proposed Report and Findings, and stating any additional considerations supporting the proposed recommendation. This tentative determination shall be a public document.

              (2) In preparing the Proposed Report and Findings, the EPA staff shall attempt to the maximum extent feasible to avoid revealing confidential information which, if revealed, might damage the legitimate business interests of the applicant. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, the tentative determination shall be accompanied by a listing of all materials considered by EPA staff in developing the tentative determination. Subject to the provisions of § 57.814(a), full copies of all such materials shall be included in the administrative record under § 57.814, except that, to the extent the material consists of published material which is generally available, full citations to that material may be given instead.
              (b) Public notice. Public notice of EPA's tentative determination to grant or deny an application for a waiver shall be given by:
              (1) Publication at least once in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the smelter is located; and
              (2) Posting in the principal office of the municipality in which the smelter is located.
              (c) Individual notice. Individual notice of EPA's tentative determination to grant or deny an application for a waiver shall be mailed to the smelter owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and to the air pollution control agency for the State in which the smelter is located.
              (d) Request for individual notice. EPA shall mail notice of its tentative determination to grant or deny an application for waiver to any person upon request. Each such request shall be submitted to the Administrator in writing, shall state that the request is for individual notice of tentative determination to grant or deny any application for a waiver under section 119(d) of the Clean Air Act, and shall describe the notice or types of notices desired (e.g., all notices, notices for a particular Region, notices for a particular State, notice for a particular city).
              (e) Form of notice. The notice of tentative determination required to be distributed under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall include, in addition to any other materials, the following:
              (1) A summary of the information contained in appendix A;
              (2) The tentative determination prepared under paragraph (a) of this section: Provided, that except in the case of the smelter owner, a summary of the basis for the grant or denial of the waiver may be provided in lieu of the formal determinations required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
              (3) A brief description of the procedures set forth in § 57.804 for requesting a public hearing on the waiver request, including a statement that such request must be filed within 30 days of the date of the notice;
              (4) A statement that written comments on the tentative determination submitted to EPA within 60 days of the date of the notice will be considered by EPA in making a final decision on the application; and
              (5) The location of the administrative record and the location at which interested persons may obtain further information on the tentative determination, including a copy of the index to the record, the tentative determination prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, and any other nonconfidential record materials.
            
            
              § 57.804
              Request for hearing; request to participate in hearing.
              (a) Request for hearing. Within 30 days of the date of publication or receipt of the notice required by § 57.803, any person may request the Administrator to hold a hearing on the tentative determination by submitting a written request containing the following:
              (1) Identification of the person requesting the hearing and his interest in the proceeding;
              (2) A statement of any objections to the tentative determination; and
              (3) A statement of the issues which such person proposes to raise for consideration at such hearing.
              (b) Grant or denial of hearing; notification. Whenever (1) the Administrator has received a written request satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section which presents genuine issues as to the effect on the smelter of the requirement for use of constant controls, or (2) the Administrator determines in his discretion that a hearing is necessary or appropriate the Administrator shall give written notice of his determination to each person requesting such hearing and the smelter owner, and shall provide public notice of his determination in accordance with § 57.803(b). If the Administrator determines that a request filed under paragraph (a) of this section does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) or does not present genuine issues, he shall be given written notice of his decision to deny a hearing to the person requesting the hearing.
              
              (c) Form of notice of hearing. Each notice of hearing disseminated under paragraph (b) of this section shall contain:
              (1) A statement of the time and place of the hearing;
              (2) A statement identifying the place at which the official record on the application for waiver is located, the hours during which it will be open for public inspection, and the documents contained in the record as of the date of the notice of hearing;
              (3) The due date for filing a written request to participate in the hearing under paragraph (d) of this section;

              (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person in the proceeding;
              (2) A brief outline of the points to be addressed;
              (3) An estimate of the time required; and
              (4) If the request is submitted by an organization, a nonbinding list of the persons to take part in the presentation. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than two weeks before the scheduled date of the hearing, the Hearing Clerk shall make available to the public and shall mail to each person who asked to participate in the hearing a hearing schedule.
              (e) Effect of denial of or absence of request for hearing. If no request for a hearing is made under this section, or if all such requests are denied under paragraph (b) of this section, the tentative determination issued under § 57.803 shall be treated procedurally as if it were a recommended decision issued under § 57.811(b)(2), except that for purposes of §§ 57.812 and 57.813 the term “hearing participant” shall be construed to mean the smelter owner and any person who submitted comments under § 57.803(e)(4).
            
            
              § 57.805
              Submission of written comments on tentative determination.
              (a) Main comments. Each person who has filed a request to participate in the hearing shall file with the Hearing Clerk no later than 30 days before the scheduled start of the hearing (or such other date as may be set forth in the notice of hearing) any comments which he has on the request for waiver and EPA's tentative determination, based on information which is or reasonably could have been available to that person at the time.
              (b) Reply comments. Not later than two weeks after a full transcript of the hearing becomes available (or such other date as may be set forth in the notice of hearing), each person who has filed a request to participate in the hearing shall file with the Hearing Clerk any comments he may have on:
              (1) Written comments submitted by other participants pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section;
              (2) Written comments submitted in response to the notice of hearing;
              (3) Material in the hearing record; and
              (4) Material which was not and could not reasonably have been available prior to the deadline for submission of main comments under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Form of comments. All comments should be submitted in quadruplicate and shall include any affidavits, studies, tests or other materials relied upon for making any factual statements in the comments.
              (d) Use of comments. (1) Written comments filed under this section shall constitute the bulk of the evidence submitted at the hearing. Oral statements at the hearing should be brief, and restricted either to points that could not have been made in written comments, or to emphasizing points which are made in the comments, but which the participant believes can be more forcefully urged in the hearing context.

              (2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, within two weeks prior to either deadline specified by paragraph (a) of this section for the filing of main comments, any person who has filed a request to participate in the hearing may file a request with the Presiding Officer to submit all or part of his main comments orally at the hearing in lieu of submitting written comments. The Presiding Officer shall, within one week, grant such request if he finds that such person will be prejudiced if he is required to submit such comments in written form.
            
            
              § 57.806
              Presiding Officer.
              (a) Assignment of Presiding Officer. (1) The Administrator shall, as soon as practicable after the granting of a request for hearing under § 57.803, request that the Chief Administrative Law Judge assign an Administrative Law Judge as Presiding Officer. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall thereupon make the assignment.
              (2) If the parties to the hearing waive their right to have the Agency or an Administrative Law Judge preside at the hearing, the Administrator shall appoint an EPA employee who is an attorney to serve as presiding officer.
              (b) Powers and duties of Presiding Officer. It shall be the duty of the Presiding Officer to conduct a fair and impartial hearing, assure that the facts are fully elicited, and avoid delay. The Presiding Officer shall have authority to:
              (1) Chair and conduct administrative hearings held under this subpart;
              (2) Administer oaths and affirmations;
              (3) Receive relevant evidence: Provided, that the administrative record, as defined in § 57.814, shall be received in evidence;
              (4) Consider and rule upon motions, dispose of procedural requests, and issue all necessary orders;
              (5) Hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues or the expediting of the proceedings; and
              (6) Do all other acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance of order and for the efficient, fair and impartial conduct of proceedings under this subpart.

              § 57.807
              Hearing.
              (a) Composition of hearing panel. The Presiding Officer shall preside at the hearing held under this subpart. An EPA panel shall also take part in the hearing. In general, the membership of the panel shall consist of EPA employees having special expertise in areas related to the issues to be addressed at the hearing, including economists and engineers. For this reason, the membership of the panel may change as different issues are presented for discussion.
              (b) Additional hearing participants. Either before or during the hearing, the Presiding Officer, after consultation with the panel, may request that a person not then scheduled to participate in the hearing (including an EPA employee or a person identified by any scheduled hearing participant as having knowledge concerning the issues raised for discussion at the hearing) make a presentation or make himself available for cross-examination at the hearing.
              (c) Questioning of hearing participants. The panel members may question any person participating in the hearing. Cross-examination by persons other than panel members shall not be permitted at this stage of the proceeding except where the Presiding Officer determines, after consultation with the panel, that circumstances compel such cross-examination. However, persons in the hearing audience, including other hearing participants, may submit written questions to the Presiding Officer for the Presiding Officer to ask the participants, and the Presiding Officer may, after consultation with the panel, and in his sole discretion, ask these questions.
              (d) Submission of additional material. Participants in the hearing shall submit for the hearing record such additional material as the hearing panel may request within 10 days following the close of the hearing, or such other period of time as is ordered by the Presiding Officer. Participants may also submit additional information for the hearing record on their own accord within 10 days after the close of the hearing.
              (e) Transcript. A verbatim transcript shall be made of the hearing.
            
            
              
              § 57.808
              Opportunity for cross-examination.
              (a) Request for cross-examination. After the close of the panel hearing conducted under this part, any participant in that hearing may submit a written request for cross-examination. The request shall be received by EPA within one week after a full transcript of the hearing becomes available and shall specify:
              (1) The disputed issue(s) of material fact as to which cross-examination is requested. This shall include an explanation of why the questions at issue are factual, rather than of an analytical or policy nature; the extent to which they are in dispute in the light of the record made thus far, and the extent to which and why they can reasonably be considered material to the decision on the application for a waiver; and
              (2) The person(s) the participant desires to cross-examine, and an estimate of the time necessary. This shall include a statement as to why the cross-examination requested can be expected to result in full and true disclosure resolving the issue of material fact involved.
              (b) Order granting or denying request for cross-examination. As expeditiously as practicable after receipt of all requests for cross-examination under paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer, after consultation with the hearing panel, shall issue an order either granting or denying each such request, which shall be disseminated to all persons requesting cross-examination and all persons to be cross-examined. If any request for cross-examination is granted, the order shall specify:
              (1) The issues as to which cross-examination is granted;
              (2) The persons to be cross-examined on each issue;
              (3) The persons allowed to conduct cross-examination;
              (4) Time limits for the examination of witnesses; and
              (5) The date, time and place of the supplementary hearing at which cross-examination shall take place. In issuing this ruling, the Presiding Officer may determine that one or more participants have the same or similar interests and that to prevent unduly repetitious cross-examination, they should be required to choose a single representative for purposes of cross-examination. In such a case, the order shall simply assign time for cross-examination by that single representative without identifying the representative further.
              (c) Supplementary hearing. The Presiding Officer and at least one member of the original hearing panel shall preside at the supplementary hearing. During the course of the hearing, the Presiding Officer shall have authority to modify any order issued under paragraph (b) of this section. A verbatim transcript shall be made of this hearing.
              (d) Alternatives to cross-examination. (1) No later than the time set for requesting cross-examination, a hearing participant may request that alternative methods of clarifying the record (such as the submittal of additional written information) be used in lieu of or in addition to cross-examination. The Presiding Officer shall issue an order granting or denying such request at the time he issues (or would have issued) an order under paragraph (b) of this section. If the request is granted, the order shall specify the alternative provided and any other relevant information (e.g., the due date for submitting written information).
              (2) In passing on any request for cross-examination submitted under paragraph (a) of this section, the Presiding Officer may, as a precondition to ruling on the merits of such request, require that alternative means of clarifying the record be used whether or not a request to do so has been made under the preceding paragraph. The person requesting cross-examination shall have one week to comment on the results of utilizing such alternative means, following which the Presiding Officer, as soon as practicable, shall issue an order granting or denying such person's request for cross-examination.
            
            
              § 57.809
              
                Ex parte communications.
              (a) General. (1) No interested person outside the Agency or member of the Agency trial staff shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any member of the decisional body an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceedings.

              (2) No member of the decisional body shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested person outside the Agency or member of the Agency trial staff an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceedings.
              (b) Effect of receipt of ex parte communication. (1) A member of the decisional body who receives or who makes or knowingly causes to be made a communication prohibited by this subsection shall place in the record all written communications or memoranda stating the substance of all oral communications together with all written responses and memoranda stating the substance of all responses.

              (2) Upon receipt by any member of the decisionmaking body of an ex parte communication knowingly made or knowingly caused to be made by a party or representative of a party in violation of this section, the person presiding at the stage of the hearing then in progress may, to the extent consistent with justice and the policy of the Clean Air Act, require the party to show cause why its claim or interest in the proceedings should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation.
              (c) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
              (1) Agency trial staff means those Agency employees, whether temporary or permanent, who have been designated by the Agency as available to investigate, litigate, and present the evidence arguments and position of the Agency in the evidentiary hearing or non-adversary panel hearing. Appearance as a witness does not necessarily require a person to be designated as a member of the Agency trial staff;
              (2) Decisional body means any Agency employee who is or may be reasonably expected to be involved in the decisional process of the proceeding including the Administrator, Presiding Officer, the Regional Administrator (if he does not designate himself as a member of the Agency trial staff), and any of their staff participating in the decisional process. In the case of a non-adversary panel hearing, the decisional body shall also include the panel members whether or not permanently employed by the Agency;
              (3) Ex parte communication means any communication, written or oral, relating to the merits of the proceeding between the decisional body and an interested person outside the Agency or the Agency trial staff which was not originally filed or stated in the administrative record or in the hearing. Ex parte communications do not include:
              (i) Communications between Agency employees other than between the Agency trial staff and the member of the decisional body;
              (ii) Discussions between the decisional body and either:
              (A) Interested persons outside the Agency, or;
              (B) The Agency trial staff if all parties have received prior written notice of such proposed communications and have been given the opportunity to be present and participate therein.
              (4) Interested person outside the Agency includes the smelter owner, any person who filed written comments in the proceeding, any person who requested the hearing, any person who requested to participate or intervene in the hearing, any participant or party in the hearing and any other interested person not employed by the Agency at the time of the communications, and the attorney of record for such persons.

              § 57.810
              Filing of briefs, proposed findings, and proposed recommendations.

              Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer, each hearing participant may, within 20 days after reply comments are submitted under § 57.805(b), or if a supplementary hearing for the purpose of cross-examination has been held under § 57.808(c), within 20 days after the transcript of such supplemental hearing becomes available or if alternative methods of clarifying the record have been used under § 57.808(d), within 20 days after the alternative methods have been employed, file with the Hearing Clerk and serve upon all other hearing participants proposed findings and proposed recommendations to replace in whole or in part the findings and recommendations contained in the tentative determination. Any such person may also file, at the same time, a brief in support of his proposals, together with references to relevant pages of transcript and to relevant exhibits. Within 10 days thereafter each participant may file a reply brief concerning alternative proposals. Oral argument may be held at the discretion of the Presiding Officer on motion of any hearing participant or sua sponte.
            
            
              § 57.811
              Recommended decision.
              As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the hearing, one or more responsible employees of the Agency shall evaluate the record for preparation of a recommended decision and shall prepare and file a recommended decision with the Hearing Clerk. The employee(s) preparing the decision will generally be members of the hearing panel and may include the Presiding Officer. Such employee(s) may consult with and receive assistance from any member of the hearing panel in drafting a recommended decision and may also delegate the preparation of the recommended decision to the panel or to any member or members of it. This decision shall contain the same elements as the tentative determination. After the recommended decision has been filed, the Hearing Clerk shall serve a copy of such decision on each hearing participant and upon the Administrator.
            
            
              § 57.812
              Appeal from or review of recommended decision.
              (a) Exceptions. (1) Within 20 days after service of the recommended decision, any hearing participant may take exception to any matter set forth in such decision or to any adverse order or ruling of the Presiding Officer prior to or during the hearing to which such participant objected, and may appeal such exceptions to the Administrator by filing them in writing with the Hearing Clerk. Such exceptions shall contain alternative findings and recommendations, together with references to the relevant pages of the record and recommended decision. A copy of each document taking exception to the recommended decision shall be served upon every other hearing participant. Within the same period of time each party filing exceptions shall file with the Administrator and shall serve upon all hearing participants a brief concerning each of the exceptions being appealed. Each brief shall include page references to the relevant portions of the record and to the recommended decision.
              (2) Within 10 days of the service of exceptions and briefs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any hearing participant may file and serve a reply brief responding to exceptions or arguments raised by any other hearing participant together with references to the relevant portions of the record, recommended decision, or opposing brief. Reply briefs shall not, however, raise additional exceptions.
              (b) Sua sponte review by the Administrator. Whenever the Administrator determines sua sponte to review a recommended decision, notice of such intention shall be served upon the parties by the Hearing Clerk within 30 days after the date of service of the recommended decision. Such notice shall include a statement of issues to be briefed by the hearing participants and a time schedule for the service and filing of briefs.
              (c) Scope of appeal or review. The appeal of the recommended decision shall be limited to the issues raised by the appellant, except when the Administrator determines that additional issues should be briefed or argued. If the Administrator determines that briefing or argument of additional issues is warranted, all hearing participants shall be given reasonable written notice of such determination to permit preparation of adequate argument.
              (d) Argument before the Administrator. The Administrator may, upon request by a party or sua sponte, set a matter for oral argument. The time and place for such oral argument shall be assigned after giving consideration to the convenience of the parties.
            
            
              § 57.813
              Final decision.
              (a) After review. As soon as practicable after all appeal or other review proceedings have been completed, the Administrator shall issue his final decision. Such a final decision shall include the same elements as the recommended decision, as well as any additional reasons supporting his decisions on exceptions filed by hearing participants. The final decision may accept or reject all or part of the recommended decision. The Administrator may consult with the Presiding Officer, members of the hearing panel or any other EPA employee in preparing his final decision. The Hearing Clerk shall file a copy of the decision on all hearing participants.
              (b) In the absence of review. If no party appeals a recommended decision to the Administrator and if the Administrator does not review it sua sponte, he shall be deemed to have adopted the recommended decision as the final decision of the Agency upon the expiration of the time for filing any exceptions under § 57.812(a).
              (c) Timing of judicial review. For purposes of judicial review, final Agency action on a request for a waiver of the interim requirement that each NSO provide for the use of constant controls shall not occur until EPA approves or disapproves the issuance of an NSO to the source requesting such a waiver.
            
            
              § 57.814
              Administrative record.
              (a) Establishment of record. (1) Upon receipt of request for a waiver, an administrative record for that request shall be established, and a Record and Hearing Clerk appointed to supervise the filing of documents in the record and to carry out all other duties assigned to him under this subpart.
              (2) All material required to be included in the record shall be added to the record as soon as feasible after its receipt by EPA. All material in the record shall be appropriately indexed. The Hearing Clerk shall make appropriate arrangements to allow members of the public to copy all nonconfidential record materials during normal EPA business hours.
              (3) Confidential record material shall be indexed under paragraph (a)(2). Confidential record material shall, however, be physically maintained in a separate location from public record material.
              (4) Confidential record material shall consist of the following:
              (i) Any material submitted pursuant to § 57.802 for which a proper claim of confidentiality has been made under section 114(c) of the Act and 40 CFR part 2; and
              (ii) The Staff Computational Anaylsis prepared under § 57.803
              (b) Record for issuing tentative determination. The administrative record for issuing the tentative determination required by § 57.803 shall consist of the material submitted under § 57.802 and any additional materials supporting the tentative determination.
              (c) Record for acting on requests for cross-examination. The administrative record for acting on requests for cross-examination under § 57.808 shall consist of the record for issuing the tentative determination, all comments timely submitted under §§ 57.803(e)(4) and 57.805, the transcript of the hearing, and any additional material timely submitted under § 57.807(d).
              (d) Record for preparation of recommended decision. The administrative record for preparation of the recommended decision required by § 57.811 shall consist of the record for acting on request for cross-examination, the transcript of any supplementary hearing held under § 57.808(c), any materials timely submitted in lieu of or in addition to cross-examination under § 57.808(d), and all briefs, proposed findings of fact and proposed recommendations timely submitted under § 57.810.
              (e) Record for issuance of final decision. (1) Where no hearing has been held, the administrative record for issuance of the Administrator's final decision shall consist of the record for issuing the tentative determination, any comments timely submitted under § 57.803(e)(4), any briefs or reply briefs timely submitted under § 57.812 (a) through (c), and the transcript of any oral argument granted under § 57.812(d).
              (2) Where a hearing has been held, the administrative record for issuance of the Administrator's final decision shall consist of the record of preparation of the recommended decision, any briefs or reply briefs submitted under § 57.812 (a) through (c), and the transcript of any oral argument granted under § 57.812(d).
            
            
              
              § 57.815
              State notification.
              The Administrator shall give notice of the final decision in writing to the air pollution control agency of the State in which the smelter is located.
            
            
              § 57.816
              Effect of negative recommendation.
              No waiver of the interim requirement for the use of constant controls shall be granted by the Administrator or a State unless the Administrator or a State first takes into account the Administrator's report, findings, and recommendations as to whether the use of constant controls would be so costly as to necessitate permanent or prolonged temporary cessations of operation of the smelter.

              1. General Instructions
              1.1 Purpose of the application. This application provides financial reporting schedules and the accompanying instructions for EPA's determination of eligibility for a nonferrous smelter order (NSO), and for a waiver of the interim constant controls requirement of an NSO. Although the determination of eligibility for an NSO is prerequisite for the determination of a waiver, appendix A, as a matter of convenience to applicants, includes both the NSO and waiver tests and reporting schedules.
              In order to support an NSO eligibility determination, the applicant must submit operating and financial data as specified by the schedules included in this application. Specific instructions for completing each schedule are provided in subsequent sections of the instructions. In general, applicants must provide:
              (a) Annual income statements, balance sheets and supporting data covering the five most recent fiscal years for the smelter for which the NSO requested.
              (b) Forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, net income from operations and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations subject to this application, on the basis of anticipated smelter operations without any sulfur dioxide air pollution control facilities that have not been installed as of the NSO application date.
              (c) Forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, net income from operations and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations subject to this application, on the basis of anticipated smelter operations with expected additional sulfur dioxide control facilities required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation.

              (d) For smelters applying for a waiver of interim constant controls, forecasts of operating revenues, operating costs, and capital investments for the firm's smelter operations prepared on the basis of two alternative assumptions: (1) Installation of additional pollution control facilities required to comply with interim constant control requirements, no installation of any additional SO2 controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and closure of the smelter after January 1, 1988; and (2) installation of additional pollution control facilities required to comply with interim constant control requirements, installation of any additional SO2 controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, and continued operation of the smelter after January 1, 1988.
              1.2 NSO financial tests. EPA will use separate tests to determine eligibility for an NSO and to evaluate applications for a waiver of the interim constant control requirement. The two tests for NSO eligibility employ a present value approach for determining the reasonable availability of constant control technology that will enable an applicant to achieve full compliance with its SIP sulfur dioxide emission limitation. The tests for the waiver of the interim constant control requirements employ variable costing and discounted cash flow standards for evaluating an applicant's economic capability to implement those requirements.
              1.2.1 NSO Eligibility Tests. Each applicant must establish that the system of production and/or constant control technology that will enable the smelter to achieve full compliance with its SIP SO2 emission limitation standard is not reasonably available. An applicant will determine financial eligibility for an NSO by passing at least one of the following two tests.
              (a) Profit Protection Test. The smelter will experience a reduction in pre-tax profits of 50 percent or more after undertaking the required installation of constant controls.
              (b) Rate of Return Test. The smelter will earn a rate of return on historical net investment, expressed in constant dollars, below the industry average cost of capital after undertaking the required installation of constant controls.
              1.2.2 Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls. Applicants that do not have an existing constant control system or whose constant controls are not sufficient when in operation and optimally maintained to treat all strong streams in accordance with subpart C, may apply for a waiver of the requirements of subpart C with respect to any interim constant controls not already installed. Applicants will be eligible for a temporary waiver of the requirement for interim constant controls not already installed, if they can establish pursuant to the procedures in this application that the imposition of such control requirements would economically necessitate closure of the smelter facility for a period of one year or longer. The economic justification for a non-permanent closure under this temporary waiver test is defined as a situation in which the smelter's projected operating revenues for one or more years during which the NSO is in effect are inadequate to cover variable operating costs anticipated after installing the required interim control technology. Temporary waivers will be granted for only the period of time over which applicants can establish an inability by the firm to cover its variable operating costs. Interim control waiver requests based on the smelter's projected inability to earn adequate income after installation of interim pollution control equipment will be subject to the permanent waiver test.
              1.2.3 Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls. Applicants that do not have an existing constant control system or whose constant controls are not sufficient when in operation and optimally maintained to treat all strong streams in accordance with subpart C, may apply for a waiver of the requirements of subpart C with respect to any interim constant controls not already installed. Applicants will be eligible for a permanent waiver of the requirement for interim constant controls not already installed, if they can establish pursuant to the procedures in this application that an imposition of such control requirements would necessitate permanent closure of the smelter. Economic justification for a permanent closure is defined as a situation in which the present value of future cash flows anticipated from the smelter after installing the required interim control technology is less than the smelter's current salvage value under an orderly plan of liquidation. Future cash flows are determined under two alternative assumptions. The higher present value of cash flows computed under these assumptions is then compared to salvage value.
              1.2.4 EPA Contact for NSO Inquiries. Inquiries concerning this portion of the requirements for NSO application should be addressed to Laxmi M. Kesari, Environmental Protection Agency, EN 341, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.
              1.2.5 Certification. The NSO Certification Statement must be signed by an authorized officer of the applicant firm.

              1.3 Confidentiality. Applicants may request that information contained in this application be treated as confidential. Agency regulations concerning claims of confidentiality of business information are contained in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B (41 FR 36902 et seq., September 1, 1976, as amended by 43 FR 39997 et seq., September 8, 1978). The regulations provide that a business may, if it desires, assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information furnished to EPA. The claim must be made at the same time the applicable information is submitted. The manner of asserting such claims is specified in 40 CFR 2.203(b). Information covered by such a claim will be handled by the Agency in accordance with procedures set forth in the subpart B regulations. EPA will not disclose information on a business that has made a claim of confidentiality, except to the extent of and in accordance with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. However, if no claim of confidentiality is made when information is furnished to EPA, the information may be made available to the public without notice to the business.
              2. NSO Financial Reporting Overview
              2.1 Revenue and Cost Assignment. The amounts assigned to operations of the smelter subject to this NSO application should include (1) revenues and costs directly attributable to the smelter's operating activities and (2) indirect operating costs shared with other segments of the firm to the extent that a specific causal and beneficial relationship can be identified for the allocation of such costs to the smelter. Do not allocate revenues and costs associated with central administrative activities for which specific causal and beneficial relationships to the activities of the smelter cannot be established. Nonallocable items include, but are not restricted to, amounts such as dividend and interest income on centrally administered portfolio investments, central corporate administrative office expenses and, except for schedules supporting the Profit Protection Test, interest on long-term debt financing arrangements. Provide a detailed explanation of amounts classified as nontraceable on a separate schedule and attach as part of Exhibit B.
              2.2 Transfer Prices on Affiliated Part Transactions. Certain transactions by the smelter subject to an NSO application may reflect sales to or purchases from “affiliated” customers or suppliers with whom the smelter has a common bond of ownership and/or managerial control. In preparing this application, affiliated party transactions shall be defined as transactions with any entity that the firm, or its owners, controls directly or indirectly either through an ownership of 10 percent or more of the entity's voting interests or through an exercise of managerial responsibility. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B supporting schedules explaining the pricing policies established on affiliated party transactions incorporated in the financial reporting schedules.
              Prices on inter-segment material and product transfers within a firm, or on external purchases from and sales to other affiliated suppliers and customers, may differ from the prices on comparable transactions with unaffiliated suppliers and customers. In this event, applicants also must present in the Exhibit B supporting schedules and incorporate in the NSO financial reporting schedules appropriate adjustments for restating affiliated party transactions. Affiliated party transactions must be restated at either (a) equivalent prices on comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties if such price quotations can be obtained or (b) prices that provide the selling entity with a normal profit margin above its cost of sales if a meaningful comparison with unaffiliated transaction prices cannot be established.

              A “normal” profit margin is defined as the gross operating profit per dollar of operating revenue that will provide an average after-tax rate of return on permanent capital (total assets less current liabilities). This average rate of return is defined differently for the historical and forecast periods. The applicant must use a rate of return of 8.0 percent for the historical period. This figure is based on a historical average earned rate of return for the nonferrous metals industry. 1

                 EPA may update this figure periodically. The updates will be available in the rulemaking docket or from the INFORMATION CONTACT noted in the Federal Register. For the forecast period, the applicant must use a rate of return equal to the current weighted average cost of capital for the nonferrous metals industry, as computed in Section 2.6.
              
                
                  1 The derivation of this figure is explained in two memoranda to EPA (Item Nos. II-A-1 and IV-A-6a in EPA Docket No. A-82-35).
              
              Forecast smelting charges for integrated smelters can be computed from forecast market smelting charges. Integrated copper smelters may use as the basis of their forecast revenues the forecast copper smelting charges provided by EPA, adjusted as described in Section 2.4.1. An applicant may submit other forecasts, providing the forecast methodology is in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 and fully documented as part of Exhibit B.
              2.3 Forecasting Requirements. NSO applicants must provide the Agency with financial forecasts in Schedules B.1 through B.6 and C.1 through C.2. Applicants requesting either a temporary or permanent waiver from interim constant control requirements also must provide an additional set of financial forecasts in Schedules D.1 through D.4.
              2.3.1 Forecast Period. The forecast period must include at least two full years following completion and startup of the required pollution control system. The forecast period shall be from 1984 through 1990 for an NSO application filed in 1984. If an application is filed in a later year, the 1984 through 1990 period should be adjusted accordingly. All references in this appendix to the period 1984 through 1990 should be interpreted accordingly.

              2.3.2 Forecast Adjustment by Control Case. Some line items that have the same title in several schedules may contain different information because they are based on different assumptions regarding pollution controls. Production interruptions or curtailments due to the installation of pollution control facilities may require adjustments to certain revenue and cost estimates in the respective control cases. For example, production curtailments associated with supplementary control systems may be the basis for the pre-control case, yet are eliminated when constant controls replace supplementary control systems in the constant controls case. The application of pollution control techniques that involve process changes in the smelter's operations (e.g., conversion to flash smelting) also may require specific forecasts by applications of associated impacts on incremental operating revenues and costs.
              2.3.3 Nominal Dollar Basis. Applicants must make their financial forecasts in terms of nominal dollars. Forecasts of selected parameters provided by EPA will furnish guidelines to an applicant in preparing the required cost and revenue estimates. In particular, copper smelting charges provided in nominal-dollar terms must be used directly by the applicant as given; i.e., the stipulated charge estimates should not be inflated.
              2.3.4 Tolling Service Equivalent Basis. Applicants must express all revenue forecasts on a tolling service equivalent basis. Thus, forecast revenues are computed as the product of the forecast quantity of processed concentrate, the forecast average product grade of the concentrate (the percent of metal in the concentrate), and the forecast smelting charge. Smelters that are not tolling smelters and that do not use the copper smelting charges provided by EPA (as described in Section 2.4.1) can forecast a smelting charge from forecast product grade of the concentrate, percent recovery, and product and concentrate prices. The forecast prices and derivation of the smelting charge must be in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5, and the methodology must be fully documented in Exhibit B.
              2.4 EPA Furnished Forecast Data. In making projection for the period 1984 through 1990, applicants must, except as noted below, use the indices provided by EPA. The table below presents yearly values for each index (expressed as annual percentage rates of change) to be used by smelters applying for an NSO before January 1, 1985. If forecasts are needed for 1991 and EPA has not provided new forecasts, applicants should use the Data Resources, Inc. forecasts for 1991 (Docket Item No. IV-A-6c) and the average of CRU's forecasts for 1989 and 1990 (expressed in 1991 dollars).

              2.4.1 Copper smelting charge. EPA will supply a forecast of reference copper smelting charges. These charges, which are f.o.b. U.S. mine, are based on an estimate of export smelting charges and on the differential value of copper in the U.S. and the world market. They must be used in forecasting unaffiliated party revenues for the period following the expiration of existing contracts and in forecasting affiliated party revenues for the entire forecast period. The applicant may submit its own smelting charge forecast for the post-contract period, provided that such forecast is in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 and fully documented and substantiated as part of Exhibit B.
              The EPA forecast export charge represents the world market copper smelting charge with copper valued at the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper price. This charge serves as the reference charge for the applicant copper smelter in calculating its smelting charges. Applicant copper smelters must derive their smelting charges from this world market charge as described in paragraph (a) below.
              The applicant may adjust the derived smelter-specific smelting charge to account for other factors, provided the adjustments are fully documented as part of Exhibit B. An example of such a factor is the unit deduction for metallurgical losses in smelting. Adjustment for this factor is discussed in paragraph (b) below.

              (a) The derivation of a smelter-specific smelting charge from the world market charge is based on assumptions regarding transportation costs and the U.S. producer-world copper price differential. The EPA forecast export charge is the forecast smelting charge available at a Japanese smelter, with copper valued at the London Metal Exchange copper price. The charge includes no freight costs, which must be paid by the mine. A U.S. smelter determines its smelting charge to a mine by meeting the combined world market smelting charge, adjusted to reflect copper valued at the U.S. producer price, and the transportation charge from the mine to the Japanese smelter. This combined price is the highest that a mine is willing to pay for smelting.
              The smelter's net smelting charge is equal to the combined world smelting charge, adjusted to the U.S. producer price for copper (i.e., the export forecast charge plus the U.S. producer price premium), and the transportation cost between the mine and a Far East smelter, minus the cost of transporting the concentrate between the mine and the applicant smelter.
              The applicant smelter's net smelting charge for concentrate from an individual mine is computed by first adding the U.S. producer Price-LME world price differential to the EPA-supplied forecast. The cost of transporting copper from the U.S. mine to the Far East is then added to this figure. The net smelting charge is obtained by subtracting from this total the cost of transporting copper from the mine to the applicant smelter. In making these calculations, an applicant must supply (and fully document in Exhibit B), the freight cost between the mine and the Far East and between the mine and the smelter. This freight cost must be converted to nominal dollars of the respective forecast years by applying the GNP percentage price change forecasts supplied by EPA or smelter-provided forecasts of transportation price changes. The smelter-provided forecasts of transportation price changes must comply with guidelines regarding such forecasts in Section 2.5.

              An applicant must use a 3 cent per pound U.S. producer price premium (relative to the LME price) in calculating the smelter's net smelting charge. The applicant may substitute its own forecasts of the U.S. producer price premium if it can substantiate such forecasts in accordance with the guidelines in Section 2.5 regarding applicant-provided smelting charge forecasts of principal products. All supporting documentation for such applicant-supplied forecasts must be supplied in Exhibit B. Any updates of the producer price premium will be available in the rulemaking docket or from the INFORMATION CONTACT noted in the Federal Register.
              
              The following two representative examples illustrate this methodology for making the transportation and U. S. producer price premium adjustment.
              (1) The applicant smelter, located in Arizona, obtains concentrate from an adjacent mine. The freight charge from mine to smelter is zero. The mine is willing to pay the applicant smelter an amount no higher than the sum of the world market smelting charge (adjusted for the copper value differential) and the transportation cost of shipping copper from the mine to the Far East. This combined cost is the net charge received by the applicant smelter. If the export smelting charge is 12 cents per pound and the freight cost between the mine and the Far East is 13 cents per pound, the applicant smelter would calculate a net smelting charge equal to 28 cents: 12 cents plus 3 cents (for the U.S. producer price premium) plus 13 cents (for the freight cost between the mine and the Far East).
              (2) The applicant smelter obtains concentrate from a nonadjacent mine. The mine will pay a charge no higher than the total market smelting charge, valued at the U.S. producer price, and the transportation costs between the mine and a Far East smelter. The applicant's net smelting charge is equal to this combined cost minus the transportation costs for shipping the concentrate between mine and applicant smelter.
              Suppose that the mine to Far East freight charge is 13 cents per pound and the mine to applicant smelter freight charge is 4 cents per pound. If the export smelting charge is 12 cents per pound, the net smelting charge is equal to 24 cents per pound: 12 cents plus 3 cents (for the U.S. producer price premium) plus 13 cents (for the freight cost to the Far East) minus 4 cents (for the freight cost to the applicant smelter).
              (b) The EPA forecast charges are based on a one unit deduction for metallurgical losses. This means that if a concentrate grades 25 percent copper, the mine is only credited with 24 percent for metal return. The one unit deduction on 25 percent concentrate is equivalent to a 96 percent payment for contained copper. Should a smelter recover less than 96 percent, its revenue would be less than the EPA forecast smelting charge. Should a smelter recover more than 96 percent, its revenue would be greater than the EPA forecast smelting charge.

              2.4.2 Indices (Annual Percentage Changes). These indices, which are expressed as annual percentage rate changes in price (wages, energy prices, and GNP price deflator) must be used only for estimating the rate of price increases for the forecast period following the expiration of the applicant's current contracts. The applicant may use alternative forecasts of annual percentage changes for the forecast period following the expiration of current contracts, if justification is provided. Any such alternative forecasts must be prepared by a widely-recognized forecasting authority with expertise comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA. In addition, the documentation of these forecasts must be comparable to that provided by EPA's forecaster.
              The wage indices are to be applied to wage paid to manufacturing labor. The energy price indices are to be applied to prices of the respective energy products. The GNP price deflators are to be applied to prices for non-metal, non-labor, and non-energy inputs.
              2.5 Applicant Generated Forecasts. Within the specified limitations, applicants may submit a method of forecasting smelting charges and by-product, co-product and other prices. The method selected must be explained and unit prices or costs provided where applicable. The forecast elements must be compatible with an applicant's historical cost and revenue elements to permit direct comparisons of historical and forecast data. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B appropriate schedules explaining variances between forecast and historical unit costs for the smelter.
              Forecasts of the smelting charges of the smelter's principal product (i.e., copper, lead, zinc, etc.) may be prepared either by an independent forecasting authority or by the smelter's in-house personnel. If the forecasts are prepared by an independent forecasting authority, the following conditions must be satisfied: (1) The forecasting authority must have expertise comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA. (2) As much documentation of the forecasting methodology as can reasonably be obtained must be made available to EPA. Such documentation must, at a minimum, be comparable to the documentation supporting EPA smelting charge forecasts. 2
                
              
              
                
                  2 Documentation of the EPA forecasts is provided as part of Item NO. IV-A-2 in EPA Docket No. A-82-35.
              
              If the smelting charge forecasts are prepared by in-house personnel, the following conditions must be met: (1) The in-house forecasts must be certified as being based on sound methodology by an independent forecasting authority with expertise comparable to that of the forecaster who prepared the EPA-supplied smelting charges. The independent forecasting authority shall also provide a brief explanation of the basis for the conclusion reached in the certification. (2) The smelter owner shall provide EPA with the documentation of the forecasting methodology employed, which must at a minimum be comparable to the extent of documentation supporting EPA's smelting charge forecasts. The smelter owner shall also make available upon request by EPA such additional documentation of the methodology and underlying data as EPA considers appropriate for evaluation of the forecasts.
              Forecasts of freight cost changes, which are applied to the freight costs used in calculating a smelter's net smelting charges, must be prepared by a widely-recognized forecasting authority. The forecaster's expertise must be comparable to that of the forecaster relied upon by EPA in forecasting the annual percentage changes in wages, energy prices, and GNP. The documentation of these forecasts must be comparable to that provided by EPA's forecaster.
              To the maximum extent practicable, by-product, co-product and (when applicable) unaffiliated smelting charges must be stated at market prices adjusted to f.o.b. smelter. Adjustments of these pricing bases must be made to reflect differences in grades and types of production. All adjustments must be consistent with expected sales, grades and types of concentrate processed. Applicants must attach as part of Exhibit B schedules describing and explaining the methods used to forecast these revenue items and the adjustments required for these revenue forecasts.
              Applicants must explain fully any changes from the historical data that are required to forecast labor productivity, ore-concentrate grade and composition, materials and energy consumption per unit of output, yield rates and other physical input/output relationships.
              Existing contractual terms must be used in forecasting those sales or input costs or prices to which the applicant is committed by contracts. The use of contract-dictated prices must be disclosed and supported by attaching as part of Exhibit B the terms and duration of labor and other supplier arrangements.
              Cost of compliance estimates need not be to the accuracy of final design/bid estimates; feasibility grade estimates will be acceptable. Updated cost of compliance estimates used in internal five year plans or specially prepared estimates of costs of compliance will generally be satisfactory.
              2.6 Weighted Average Cost of Capital for Nonferrous Metal Producers. The industry average cost of capital is a weighted average of the rates of return for equity and debt. Its components are the interest rate and the return on equity specific to the nonferrous metals industry.
              2.6.1 Computation. 3
                 The applicant must compute the cost of capital according to the following formula:
              
                
                  3 The derivation of the formula and the basis of the parameters are explained in two memoranda to EPA (Item Nos. II-A-1 and IV-A-6a in EPA Docket No. A-82-35).
              
              
              R = (0.65 × E) + (0.182 × I)
              
              where
              
              R = weighted average cost of capital
              E = return on equity
              I = interest rate.
              
              
              The components are calculated as follows.
              (a) Return on equity for the nonferrous metals industry. The 20 year Treasury bond yield to maturity plus a risk premium of 8.6 percent.
              (b) Interest Rate. The 20 year Treasury bond yield to maturity plus a risk premium of 3.0 percent.
              (c) Source of the 20 Year Treasury bond yield. Federal Reserve Bulletin, most recent monthly issue. Use the average yield for the most recent full month.
              2.6.2 Discount Factor. The discount factor corresponding to the weighted average cost of capital for any forecast year is computed according to the following equation:
              
                ec09no91.029
              
              where
              
              DF = discount factor
              R = weighted average cost of capital
              N = the number of years in the future (e.g., for the applicant applying in 1984, N = for the forecast year 1985).
              
              The horizon value, which is described in Section 2.7, is computed as of 1990, the end of the detailed forecast period. The discount factor to be applied to the horizon value is the same as for any other 1990 figure. For example, if the application is made in 1984, the value of N is 7.
              2.7 Horizon Value. The horizon value is the present value of a stream of cash flows or net income for 15 years beyond the last forecast year. Applicants must compute the horizon value by capitalizing the average forecast value of the last two forecast years using the current real weighted cost of capital. The line item instructions for schedules having a horizon value entry will specify the values to be capitalized.

              The applicant averages the values of the last two years after expressing both values in terms of the last year's dollars. The two-year average value is then multiplied by 9.6. This is the factor associated with capitalizing a 15 year value stream at the current real weighted cost of capital of 6.2 percent.
              Applicants must use a separate schedule to calculate the horizon value for the Rate of Return Test and the Interim Controls Test (Schedule C.5 and D.7, respectively). These separate schedules adjust for potential overstatements in the horizon value cash flows that may be caused by control equipment depreciation reported for tax purposes.
              2.8 Data Entry
              2.8.1 Rounding. All amounts (including both dollar values and physical units) reported in the schedules and exhibits accompanying this application must be rounded to the nearest thousand and expressed in thousands of dollars or units unless otherwise indicated in the instructions.
              2.8.2 Estimates. Where an applicant's records cannot produce the specific data required by this application, the use of estimates will be allowed if a meaningful estimate can be made without significant distortion of the reported results. Data estimates must be supported by attaching on a separate sheet of paper as a part of Exhibit B an explanation identifying where such estimates are used and showing explicitly how the estimates were made.
              2.8.3 Missing Data. Applicants must provide, where applicable, all operating and financial data requested by this application. Only substantially complete applications can be accepted for processing by the Agency. Questions concerning data entries for which information is not provided by or cannot reasonably be estimated from the applicant's existing accounting records should be addressed to the EPA Contact for NSO Inquiries.
              2.8.4 Historical Period. The annual data requested in the historical schedules, Schedules A.1 through A.4, must be reported for each of the five fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which this application is filed. The historical period shall be from fiscal years 1979 through 1983 for an NSO application filed in 1984. If an application is filed in a later year, the references in this appendix to the period 1979 through 1983 should be interpreted accordingly.
              2.9 Use of schedules. All applicants must complete Schedules A.1 through A.4, which record historical revenues, cost, and capital investment data. These schedules will be used by EPA to assist in evaluating forecast data. Completion of the remaining schedules depends on the test required of the applicant.
              2.9.1 NSO Eligibility. An NSO applicant must pass one of the following two tests and complete the corresponding schedules.
              (a) Profit Protection Test. The applicant must complete Schedules B.1 through B.7 to determine eligibility under the Profit Protection Test. Schedules B.1 and B.2 report the base case (without constant controls) revenue and cost forecast, respectively, and Schedule B.3 summarizes Schedules B.1 and B.2. Base case production forecasts should reflect any production curtailments associated with interim controls currently (preforecast) installed on smelters. Schedules B.4 and B.5 report the revenue and cost forecast, respectively, for the constant controls case, and Schedule B.6 summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the Profit Protection Test.

              Schedule B.7 presents the calculations for the Profit Protection Test. The applicant enters the forecast profits from Schedules B.3 and B.6. The present value of the forecast profits is then computed for each case. If the present value of forecast pre-tax profits with constant controls is less than 50 percent of the present value of forecast pre-tax profits without controls (base case) the smelter passes the test and is eligible for an NSO. The smelter also passes the test if the present value of forecast pre-tax profits without controls (base case) is negative.
              (b) Rate of Return Test. The applicant must complete Schedules B.4, B.5, and C.1 through C.5 to determine eligibility under the Rate of Return Test. Schedules B.4 and B.5 report the revenue and cost forecast, respectively, for the constant controls case, and Schedule C.1 summarizes Schedules B.4 and B.5 for the Rate of Return Test. Schedule C.2 reports forecast sustaining capital investment for the constant controls case. Schedule C.3 reports historical net investment for the most recent fiscal year expressed in constant dollars, i.e., dollars of the year in which the application is made.
              Schedule C.4 presents the calculations for the Rate of Return Test. The applicant reports in Schedule C.4 the forecast cash flows from Schedules C.1 and C.2 and the horizon value from Schedule C.5, computes their present value, and subtracts the value of invested capital in constant dollars (taken from Schedule C.3) to yield net present value. If the net present value is less than zero, the smelter passes the test and is eligible to receive an NSO. This result indicates that the smelter is expected to earn a rate of return less than the industry average cost of capital.
              2.9.2 Interim Control Waivers. An applicant for a waiver from interim controls must complete either a portion or all of Schedules D.1 through D.7, depending on whether the application is for a temporary or permanent waiver.
              (a) Temporary Waiver from Interim Controls Test. The applicant must complete Schedules D.1 through D.3 to establish eligibility for a temporary waiver from interim controls. Schedules D.1 and D.2 report forecast revenue and cost data under the assumption of installation of interim constant control equipment and no installation of any additional SO2 controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of the NSO. Schedule D.3 summarizes Schedules D.1 and D.2 and calculates gross operating profit. If gross operating profit is negative for any year during which the NSO is in effect, the applicant is eligible for a temporary waiver.
              (b) Permanent Waiver from Interim Controls Test. The applicant must complete Schedules D.1 through D.7. All schedules except for Schedule D.5 must be completed twice, based on two alternative assumptions: (1) installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of any additional SO2 controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of the NSO, and closure of the smelter after January 1, 1988; and (2) installation of interim constant control equipment, installation of any additional SO2 controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, and continued operation of the smelter after January 1, 1988.
              Schedules D.1 and D.2 report forecast revenue and cost data under each assumption. Schedule D.3 summarizes Schedules D.1 and D.2, and Schedule D.4 reports forecast sustaining capital under each assumption. Schedule D.5 reports cash proceeds from liquidation.
              Schedule D.6 presents the calculations for the permanent waiver test. In Schedule D.6, the applicant reports cash flow projections from Schedules D.3 and D.4 and the horizon value from Schedule D.7, computes their present value and subtracts the current salvage value (taken from Schedule D.5) to yield net present value. The higher of the two net present value figures computed under the two alternative assumptions must be used in the test. If the higher net present value figure is negative, the applicant is eligible for a permanent waiver.
              2.10 Use of exhibits. In addition to data required by the schedules included in this application, the following information must be attached as exhibits.

              Schedule C.5—Horizon Value of Cash Flows for the Rate of Return Test
              
                General. The applicant should use Schedule C.5 to calculate the horizon value of net cash flow projections for the Rate of Return Test. This horizon value is used in Schedule C.4. The computation of the horizon value is different for this test than for the Profit Protection Test because this test requires the reporting of depreciation for tax purposes.
              In Schedule C.5, the applicant removes the tax savings of constant controls depreciation from the cash flows for the last two forecast years. A depreciation-free horizon value is then calculated from these depreciation-free cash flows. The tax savings of constant controls depreciation during the horizon years are then calculated separately. The final horizon value is equal to the sum of the depreciation-free horizon value and the tax savings from depreciation of constant controls accruing over the horizon years. The line items in Schedule C.5 are explained in the following instructions.
              
                Line 01—Net Cash Flow Projections. Enter for each of the final two forecast years the values in Schedule C.4, Line 08, for the corresponding years.

                Line 04—Tax Savings. Enter for each of the final two forecast years the product of Lines 02 and 03.
              
                Line 05—Nominal Dollar Values. Enter for each of the final two forecast years the difference between Lines 01 and 04.
              
                Line 06—1990 Dollar Values. For each of the final two forecast years the nominal dollar values must be expressed in the last forecast year's dollars (1990 dollars). Transfer the 1990 amount in Line 05 directly to Line 06. Inflate the 1989 amount to 1990 dollars using the forecast GNP price deflator.
              
                Line 07—Average. Enter under the Total column the average of the two values in Line 06.
              
                Line 08—Horizon Factor. Enter under the Total column the horizon factor provided in Section 2.7.
              
                Line 09—Depreciation-free Horizon Value. Enter under the Total column the product of Lines 07 and 08.
              
                Line 10—Depreciation and Amortization.

These investments should include those actually made and those required to be made by the end of the forecast period. Reported charges should be computed in accordance with depreciation and amortization methods adopted for tax reporting purposes by the firm. Attach as part of Exhibit B supporting schedules consistent with those supporting Line 17 in Schedule C.1.
              
                Line 11—Marginal Tax Rate. Enter for each year of the horizon period the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.
              
                Line 12—Tax Savings. Enter for each year of the horizon period the product of Lines 10 and 11.
              
                Line 13—Discount Factors. Enter the discount factor for each year of the horizon period. This shall be computed according to the instructions under Section 2.6, except that the variable N found in the discount factor formula represents the number of years in the future, counting from the last forecast year.

              Schedule D.1—Interim Controls Revenue Forecast
              
                General. Use Schedule D.1 to report annual forecasts of operating revenues anticipated during the years 1984 through 1990 from operation of the smelter applying for an interim controls waiver. The applicant applying for a permanent waiver should complete Schedule D.1 twice, with revenue and production projections based on two alternative assumptions: (1) Installation of interim constant control equipment, no installation of any additional SO2 controls that the smelter would otherwise be required to install but for the issuance of an NSO, and closure after January 1, 1988, and (2) installation of interim constant control equipment and any additional SO2 controls required to comply with the smelter's SIP emission limitation by January 2, 1988, so that the smelter will remain open through the horizon period. The applicant applying for a temporary waiver should use only the first assumption. For a smelter that has no continuous emission controls, the assumed interim control investment program should be based on the installation and operation of a well-designed sulfuric acid plant to treat all strong gas streams. For a smelter that already has some continuous emission controls, the assumed interim constant control investment should be based on the installation and operation of any additional acid plant capacity that would be necessary for treatment of all strong streams with interim constant controls. The interim controls projections should account for other regulatory requirements on the same basis as provided for in the NSO eligibility tests.
              Forecast smelter revenues should be expressed on a tolling service equivalent basis as described in Section 2.3.4.

For purposes of allocating costs of the additional SO2 controls under the second set of assumptions, applicants must provide information establishing the period over which capital outlays for such controls would be made if installation of the controls begins the latest date that would still allow compliance to be achieved by January 2, 1988. Changes in working capital investment due to investment in control facilities may be added to the capital investment estimates shown in the corresponding supporting schedules for Schedule D.3.

                Line 12—Horizon Value. Enter under the Total column the estimated horizon value of the smelter reported in Schedule D.7, Line 16.
              
                Line 13—Discount Factor. Enter under the Total column the appropriate discount factor, computed as described in the instructions under Section 2.6.
              
                Line 14—Present Value of Horizon Value. Enter under the Total column the product of Lines 11 and 12.
              
                Line 15—Present Value of Future Cash Flows. Enter under the Total column the sum of amounts previously reported on Line 10 for 1984 through 1990.
              
                Line 16—Total Present Value. Enter the sum of Lines 13 and 14.
              
                Line 17—Current Salvage Value. Enter the amount reported in Schedule D.5, Line 17, if the value is greater than zero. If the value is zero or less, enter zero.
              
                Line 18—Net Present Value. Enter the difference between Lines 16 and 17. In determining eligibility for a permanent waiver from interim control requirements, an applicant must use the higher of the two net present value figures computed under the two alternative assumptions. Applicants reporting a negative value for the higher net present value figure will be eligible for a permanent waiver from interim use of a constant control system for sulfur dioxide emissions.
              Schedule D.7—Horizon Value of Cash Flows for the Interim Controls Test
              
                General. Use Schedule D.7 to calculate the horizon value of net cash flow projections for the Interim Controls Test. This horizon value is used in Schedule D.6. The computation of the horizon value is different for this test than for the Profit Protection Test because this test requires the reporting of depreciation for tax purposes.
              In Schedule D.7, the applicant removes the tax savings of control equipment depreciation from the cash flows for the last two forecast years. A depreciation-free horizon value is then calculated from these depreciation-free cash flows. The tax savings of constant controls depreciation during the horizon years are then calculated separately. The final horizon value is equal to the sum of the depreciation-free horizon value and the tax savings from depreciation of constant controls accruing over the horizon years. The line items in Schedule D.7 are explained in the following instruction.
              
                Line 01—Net Cash Flow Projections. Enter for each of the final two forecast years the values in Schedule D.6, Line 09, for the corresponding years.
              
                Line 02—Depreciation and Amortization. Enter for each of the final two forecast years the value in Schedule D.6, Line 03, for the corresponding years.
              
                Line 03—Marginal Tax Rate. Enter for each of the final two forecast years the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.
              
                Line 04—Tax Savings. Enter for each of the final two forecast years the product of Lines 02 and 03.
              
                Line 05—Nominal Dollar Values. Enter for each of the final two forecast years the difference between Lines 01 and 04.
              
                Line 06—1990 Dollar Values. For each of the final two forecast years the nominal dollar values must be expressed in the last forecast year's dollars (1990 dollars). Transfer the 1990 amount in Line 05 directly to Line 06. Inflate the 1989 amount to 1990 dollars using the forecast GNP price deflator.
              
                Line 07—Average. Enter under the Total column the average of the two values in Line 06.
              
                Line 08—Horizon Factor. Enter under the Total column the horizon factor provided in Section 2.7.
              
                Line 09—Depreciation-free Horizon Value. Enter under the Total column the product of Lines 07 and 08.
              
                Line 10—Depreciation and Amortization. Enter for each year of the horizon period depreciation charges associated with the smelter's investment in equipment and facilities related to pollution controls. These investments should include those actually made and those forecast to be made by the end of the forecast period. Reported charges should be computed in accordance with depreciation and amortization methods adopted for tax reporting purposes by the firm. Attach as part of exhibit B supporting schedules consistent with those supporting Line 17 in Schedule D.3.
              
                Line 11—Marginal Tax Rate. Enter for each year of the horizon period the marginal income tax rate applicable to the smelter. This rate should incorporate both Federal and State tax liability.
              
                Line 12—Tax Savings. Enter for each year of the horizon period the product of Lines 10 and 11.
              
                Line 13—Discount Factors. Enter the discount factor for each year of the horizon period. This shall be computed according to the instructions under Section 2.6, except that the variable N found in the discount factor formula represents the number of years in the future, counting from the last forecast year. For example, N = 1 for the first year of the horizon period.
              
                Line 14—Present Value of Tax Savings. Enter for each year of the horizon period the product of Lines 12 and 13.
              
                Line 15—Total Present Value of Tax Savings. Enter under the Total column the sum of values on Line 14 for the horizon years.
              
              
                Line 16—Horizon Value. Enter under the Total column the sum of Lines 09 and 15.

In the case of very large cities where two or more CBSAs are combined, these larger areas are referred to as combined statistical areas (CSAs)
              
                Corrected concentration pertains to the result of an accuracy or precision assessment test of an open path analyzer in which a high-concentration test or audit standard gas contained in a short test cell is inserted into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. When the pollutant concentration measured by the analyzer in such a test includes both the pollutant concentration in the test cell and the concentration in the atmosphere, the atmospheric pollutant concentration must be subtracted from the test measurement to obtain the corrected concentration test result. The corrected concentration is equal to the measured concentration minus the average of the atmospheric pollutant concentrations measured (without the test cell) immediately before and immediately after the test.
              
                Design value means the calculated concentration according to the applicable appendix of part 50 of this chapter for the highest site in an attainment or nonattainment area.
              
                EDO means environmental data operations.
              
                Effective concentration pertains to testing an open path analyzer with a high-concentration calibration or audit standard gas contained in a short test cell inserted into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. Effective concentration is the equivalent ambient-level concentration that would produce the same spectral absorbance over the actual atmospheric monitoring path length as produced by the high-concentration gas in the short test cell. Quantitatively, effective concentration is equal to the actual concentration of the gas standard in the test cell multiplied by the ratio of the path length of the test cell to the actual atmospheric monitoring path length.
              
                Federal equivalent method (FEM) means a method for measuring the concentration of an air pollutant in the ambient air that has been designated as an equivalent method in accordance with part 53 of this chapter; it does not include a method for which an equivalent method designation has been canceled in accordance with § 53.11 or § 53.16.
              
                Federal reference method (FRM) means a method of sampling and analyzing the ambient air for an air pollutant that is specified as a reference method in an appendix to part 50 of this chapter, or a method that has been designated as a reference method in accordance with this part; it does not include a method for which a reference method designation has been canceled in accordance with § 53.11 or § 53.16 of this chapter.

                Meteorological measurements means measurements of wind speed, wind direction, barometric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, ultraviolet radiation, and/or precipitation that occur at SLAMS stations including the NCore and PAMS networks.
              
                Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) means a CBSA associated with at least one urbanized area of 50,000 population or greater. The central-county, plus adjacent counties with a high degree of integration, comprise the area.
              
                Monitor means an instrument, sampler, analyzer, or other device that measures or assists in the measurement of atmospheric air pollutants and which is acceptable for use in ambient air surveillance under the applicable provisions of appendix C to this part.
              
                Monitoring agency means a state, local or tribal agency responsible for meeting the requirements of this part.
              
                Monitoring organization means a monitoring agency responsible for operating a monitoring site for which the quality assurance regulations apply.
              
                Monitoring path for an open path analyzer means the actual path in space between two geographical locations over which the pollutant concentration is measured and averaged.
              
                Monitoring path length of an open path analyzer means the length of the monitoring path in the atmosphere over which the average pollutant concentration measurement (path-averaged concentration) is determined. See also, optical measurement path length.
              
              
                Monitoring planning area (MPA) means a contiguous geographic area with established, well-defined boundaries, such as a CBSA, county or state, having a common area that is used for planning monitoring locations for PM2.5. A MPA may cross state boundaries, such as the Philadelphia PA-NJ MSA, and be further subdivided into community monitoring zones. The MPAs are generally oriented toward CBSAs or CSAs with populations greater than 200,000, but for convenience, those portions of a state that are not associated with CBSAs can be considered as a single MPA.
              
                NATTS means the national air toxics trends stations. This network provides hazardous air pollution ambient data.

Changes in SPM stations do not require approvals, but a change in the designation of a monitoring site from SLAMS to SPM requires approval of the Regional Administrator.
              (d) State and local governments must follow the criteria contained in appendix E to this part for siting monitor inlets, paths or probes at SLAMS stations. Appendix E adherence is optional for SPM stations.

              (e) State and local governments must assess data from Class III PM 2.5 FEM and ARM monitors operated within their network using the performance criteria described in table C-4 to subpart C of part 53 of this chapter, for cases where the data are identified as not of sufficient comparability to a collocated FRM, and the monitoring agency requests that the FEM or ARM data should not be used in comparison to the NAAQS. These assessments are required in the monitoring agency's annual monitoring network plan described in § 58.10(b) for cases where the FEM or ARM is identified as not of sufficient comparability to a collocated FRM. For these collocated PM 2.5 monitors the performance criteria apply with the following additional provisions:
              (1) The acceptable concentration range (Rj), µg/m3 may include values down to 0 µg/m3.
              (2) The minimum number of test sites shall be at least one; however, the number of test sites will generally include all locations within an agency's network with collocated FRMs and FEMs or ARMs.
              (3) The minimum number of methods shall include at least one FRM and at least one FEM or ARM.
              (4) Since multiple FRMs and FEMs may not be present at each site; the precision statistic requirement does not apply, even if precision data are available.
              (5) All seasons must be covered with no more than thirty-six consecutive months of data in total aggregated together.

              (6) The key statistical metric to include in an assessment is the bias (both additive and multiplicative) of the PM 2.5 continuous FEM(s) compared to a collocated FRM(s). Correlation is required to be reported in the assessment, but failure to meet the correlation criteria, by itself, is not cause to exclude data from a continuous FEM monitor.

              § 58.12
              Operating schedules.
              State and local governments shall collect ambient air quality data at any SLAMS station on the following operational schedules:
              (a) For continuous analyzers, consecutive hourly averages must be collected except during:
              (1) Periods of routine maintenance,
              (2) Periods of instrument calibration, or
              (3) Periods or monitoring seasons exempted by the Regional Administrator.
              (b) For Pb manual methods, at least one 24-hour sample must be collected every 6 days except during periods or seasons exempted by the Regional Administrator.
              (c) For PAMS VOC samplers, samples must be collected as specified in section 5 of appendix D to this part. Area-specific PAMS operating schedules must be included as part of the PAMS network description and must be approved by the Regional Administrator.
              (d) For manual PM 2.5 samplers:
              (1)(i) Manual PM2.5 samplers at required SLAMS stations without a collocated continuously operating PM2.5 monitor must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day schedule unless a waiver for an alternative schedule has been approved per paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) For SLAMS PM2.5 sites with both manual and continuous PM2.5 monitors operating, the monitoring agency may request approval for a reduction to 1-in-6 day PM2.5 sampling or for seasonal sampling from the EPA Regional Administrator. Other requests for a reduction to 1-in-6 day PM2.5 sampling or for seasonal sampling may be approved on a case-by-case basis. The EPA Regional Administrator may grant sampling frequency reductions after consideration of factors (including but not limited to the historical PM2.5 data quality assessments, the location of current PM2.5 design value sites, and their regulatory data needs) if the Regional Administrator determines that the reduction in sampling frequency will not compromise data needed for implementation of the NAAQS. Required SLAMS stations whose measurements determine the design value for their area and that are within ±10 percent of the annual NAAQS, and all required sites where one or more 24-hour values have exceeded the 24-hour NAAQS each year for a consecutive period of at least 3 years are required to maintain at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency until the design value no longer meets these criteria for 3 consecutive years. A continuously operating FEM or ARM PM2.5 monitor satisfies this requirement unless it is identified in the monitoring agency's annual monitoring network plan as not appropriate for comparison to the NAAQS and the EPA Regional Administrator has approved that the data from that monitor may be excluded from comparison to the NAAQS.

              (iii) Required SLAMS stations whose measurements determine the 24-hour design value for their area and whose data are within ±5 percent of the level of the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS must have an FRM or FEM operate on a daily schedule if that area's design value for the annual NAAQS is less than the level of the annual PM2.5 standard. A continuously operating FEM or ARM PM2.5 monitor satisfies this requirement unless it is identified in the monitoring agency's annual monitoring network plan as not appropriate for comparison to the NAAQS and the EPA Regional Administrator has approved that the data from that monitor may be excluded from comparison to the NAAQS. The daily schedule must be maintained until the referenced design value no longer meets these criteria for 3 consecutive years.
              (iv) Changes in sampling frequency attributable to changes in design values shall be implemented no later than January 1 of the calendar year following the certification of such data as described in § 58.15.
              (2) Manual PM 2.5 samplers at NCore stations and required regional background and regional transport sites must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency.
              (3) Manual PM2.5 speciation samplers at STN stations must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day sampling frequency unless a reduction in sampling frequency has been approved by the EPA Administrator based on factors such as area's design value, the role of the particular site in national health studies, the correlation of the site's species data with nearby sites, and presence of other leveraged measurements.
              (e) For PM 10 samplers, a 24-hour sample must be taken from midnight to midnight (local standard time) to ensure national consistency. The minimum monitoring schedule for the site in the area of expected maximum concentration shall be based on the relative level of that monitoring site concentration with respect to the 24-hour standard as illustrated in Figure 1. If the operating agency demonstrates by monitoring data that during certain periods of the year conditions preclude violation of the PM 10 24-hour standard, the increased sampling frequency for those periods or seasons may be exempted by the Regional Administrator and permitted to revert back to once in six days. The minimum sampling schedule for all other sites in the area remains once every six days. No less frequently than as part of each 5-year network assessment, the most recent year of data must be considered to estimate the air quality status at the site near the area of maximum concentration. Statistical models such as analysis of concentration frequency distributions as described in “Guideline for the Interpretation of Ozone Air Quality Standards,” EPA-450/479-003, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, January 1979, should be used. Adjustments to the monitoring schedule must be made on the basis of the 5-year network assessment. The site having the highest concentration in the most current year must be given first consideration when selecting the site for the more frequent sampling schedule. Other factors such as major change in sources of PM 10 emissions or in sampling site characteristics could influence the location of the expected maximum concentration site. Also, the use of the most recent 3 years of data might, in some cases, be justified in order to provide a more representative database from which to estimate current air quality status and to provide stability to the network. This multiyear consideration reduces the possibility of an anomalous year biasing a site selected for accelerated sampling. If the maximum concentration site based on the most current year is not selected for the more frequent operating schedule, documentation of the justification for selection of an alternative site must be submitted to the Regional Office for approval during the 5-year network assessment process. Minimum data completeness criteria, number of years of data and sampling frequency for judging attainment of the NAAQS are discussed in appendix K of part 50 of this chapter.

              (f) For manual PM 10-2.5 samplers:
              (1) Manual PM 10-2.5 samplers at NCore stations must operate on at least a 1-in-3 day schedule at sites without a collocated continuously operating federal equivalent PM 10-2.5 method that has been designated in accordance with part 53 of this chapter.

              § 58.14
              System modification.

              (a) The state, or where appropriate local, agency shall develop a network modification plan and schedule to modify the ambient air quality monitoring network that addresses the findings of the network assessment required every 5 years by § 58.10(d). The network modification plan shall be submitted as part of the Annual Monitoring Network Plan that is due no later than the year after submittal of the network assessment.
              (b) Nothing in this section shall preclude the State, or where appropriate local, agency from making modifications to the SLAMS network for reasons other than those resulting from the periodic network assessments. These modifications must be reviewed and approved by the Regional Administrator. Each monitoring network may make or be required to make changes between the 5-year assessment periods, including for example, site relocations or the addition of PAMS networks in bumped-up ozone nonattainment areas. These modifications must address changes invoked by a new census and changes due to changing air quality levels. The State, or where appropriate local, agency shall provide written communication describing the network changes to the Regional Administrator for review and approval as these changes are identified.
              (c) State, or where appropriate, local agency requests for SLAMS monitor station discontinuation, subject to the review of the Regional Administrator, will be approved if any of the following criteria are met and if the requirements of appendix D to this part, if any, continue to be met. Other requests for discontinuation may also be approved on a case-by-case basis if discontinuance does not compromise data collection needed for implementation of a NAAQS and if the requirements of appendix D to this part, if any, continue to be met.
              (1) Any PM 2.5, O3, CO, PM 10, SO2, Pb, or NO2 SLAMS monitor which has shown attainment during the previous five years, that has a probability of less than 10 percent of exceeding 80 percent of the applicable NAAQS during the next three years based on the levels, trends, and variability observed in the past, and which is not specifically required by an attainment plan or maintenance plan. In a nonattainment or maintenance area, if the most recent attainment or maintenance plan adopted by the State and approved by EPA contains a contingency measure to be triggered by an air quality concentration and the monitor to be discontinued is the only SLAMS monitor operating in the nonattainment or maintenance area, the monitor may not be discontinued.
              (2) Any SLAMS monitor for CO, PM 10, SO2, or NO2 which has consistently measured lower concentrations than another monitor for the same pollutant in the same county (or portion of a county within a distinct attainment area, nonattainment area, or maintenance area, as applicable) during the previous five years, and which is not specifically required by an attainment plan or maintenance plan, if control measures scheduled to be implemented or discontinued during the next five years would apply to the areas around both monitors and have similar effects on measured concentrations, such that the retained monitor would remain the higher reading of the two monitors being compared.
              (3) For any pollutant, any SLAMS monitor in a county (or portion of a county within a distinct attainment, nonattainment, or maintenance area, as applicable) provided the monitor has not measured violations of the applicable NAAQS in the previous five years, and the approved SIP provides for a specific, reproducible approach to representing the air quality of the affected county in the absence of actual monitoring data.
              (4) A PM 2.5 SLAMS monitor which EPA has determined cannot be compared to the relevant NAAQS because of the siting of the monitor, in accordance with § 58.30.
              (5) A SLAMS monitor that is designed to measure concentrations upwind of an urban area for purposes of characterizing transport into the area and that has not recorded violations of the relevant NAAQS in the previous five years, if discontinuation of the monitor is tied to start-up of another station also characterizing transport.

              (6) A SLAMS monitor not eligible for removal under any of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section may be moved to a nearby location with the same scale of representation if logistical problems beyond the State's control make it impossible to continue operation at its current site.

              Annual air monitoring data certification.
              (a) The state, or where appropriate local, agency shall submit to the EPA Regional Administrator an annual air monitoring data certification letter to certify data collected by FRM, FEM, and ARM monitors at SLAMS and SPM sites that meet criteria in appendix A to this part from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year. The head official in each monitoring agency, or his or her designee, shall certify that the previous year of ambient concentration and quality assurance data are completely submitted to AQS and that the ambient concentration data are accurate to the best of her or his knowledge, taking into consideration the quality assurance findings. The annual data certification letter is due by May 1 of each year.
              (b) Along with each certification letter, the state shall submit to the Regional Administrator an annual summary report of all the ambient air quality data collected by FRM, FEM, and ARM monitors at SLAMS and SPM sites. The annual report(s) shall be submitted for data collected from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year. The annual summary serves as the record of the specific data that is the object of the certification letter.
              (c) Along with each certification letter, the state shall submit to the Regional Administrator a summary of the precision and accuracy data for all ambient air quality data collected by FRM, FEM, and ARM monitors at SLAMS and SPM sites. The summary of precision and accuracy shall be submitted for data collected from January 1 to December 31 of the previous year.

Air quality data and information must be submitted directly to the AQS via electronic transmission on the specified schedule described in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.
              (b) The specific quarterly reporting periods are January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31. The data and information reported for each reporting period must contain all data and information gathered during the reporting period, and be received in the AQS within 90 days after the end of the quarterly reporting period. For example, the data for the reporting period January 1-March 31 are due on or before June 30 of that year.
              (c) Air quality data submitted for each reporting period must be edited, validated, and entered into the AQS (within the time limits specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section) pursuant to appropriate AQS procedures. The procedures for editing and validating data are described in the AQS Data Coding Manual and in each monitoring agency's quality assurance project plan.

              (d) The state shall report VOC and if collected, carbonyl, NH3, and HNO3 data from PAMS sites, and chemically speciated PM2.5 mass concentration data to AQS within 6 months following the end of each quarterly reporting period listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (e) The State shall also submit any portion or all of the SLAMS and SPM data to the appropriate Regional Administrator upon request.

              (f) The state, or where applicable, local agency shall archive all PM 2.5, PM 10, and PM 10-2.5 filters from manual low-volume samplers (samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/minute) from all SLAMS sites for a minimum period of 5 years after collection. These filters shall be made available for supplemental analyses, including destructive analyses if necessary, at the request of EPA or to provide information to state and local agencies on particulate matter composition. Other Federal agencies may request access to filters for purposes of supporting air quality management or community health—such as biological assay—through the applicable EPA Regional Administrator. The filters shall be archived according to procedures approved by the Administrator, which shall include cold storage of filters after post-sampling laboratory analyses for at least 12 months following field sampling. The EPA recommends that particulate matter filters be archived for longer periods, especially for key sites in making NAAQS-related decisions or for supporting health-related air pollution studies.

              § 58.20
              Special purpose monitors (SPM).
              (a) An SPM is defined as any monitor included in an agency's monitoring network that the agency has designated as a special purpose monitor in its annual monitoring network plan and in AQS, and which the agency does not count when showing compliance with the minimum requirements of this subpart for the number and siting of monitors of various types. Any SPM operated by an air monitoring agency must be included in the periodic assessments and annual monitoring network plan required by § 58.10. The plan shall include a statement of purposes for each SPM monitor and evidence that operation of each monitor meets the requirements of appendix A or an approved alternative as provided by § 58.11(a)(2) where applicable. The monitoring agency may designate a monitor as an SPM after January 1, 2007 only if it is a new monitor, i.e., a SLAMS monitor that is not included in the currently applicable monitoring plan or, for a monitor included in the monitoring plan prior to January 1, 2007, if the Regional Administrator has approved the discontinuation of the monitor as a SLAMS site.
              (b) Any SPM data collected by an air monitoring agency using a Federal reference method (FRM), Federal equivalent method (FEM), or approved regional method (ARM) must meet the requirements of § 58.11, § 58.12, and appendix A to this part or an approved alternative to appendix A to this part. Compliance with appendix E to this part is optional but encouraged except when the monitoring agency's data objectives are inconsistent with those requirements. Data collected at an SPM using a FRM, FEM, or ARM meeting the requirements of appendix A must be submitted to AQS according to the requirements of § 58.16. Data collected by other SPMs may be submitted. The monitoring agency must also submit to AQS an indication of whether each SPM reporting data to AQS monitor meets the requirements of appendices A and E to this part.
              (c) All data from an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM which has operated for more than 24 months are eligible for comparison to the relevant NAAQS, subject to the conditions of §§ 58.11(e) and 58.30, unless the air monitoring agency demonstrates that the data came from a particular period during which the requirements of appendix A, appendix C, or appendix E to this part were not met, subject to review and EPA Regional Office approval as part of t, App. he annual monitoring network plan described in § 58.10.

              (d) If an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM is discontinued within 24 months of start-up, the Administrator will not base a NAAQS violation determination for the PM 2.5 or ozone NAAQS solely on data from the SPM.

              (e) If an SPM using an FRM, FEM, or ARM is discontinued within 24 months of start-up, the Administrator will not designate an area as nonattainment for the CO, SO2, NO2, or 24-hour PM 10 NAAQS solely on the basis of data from the SPM. Such data are eligible for use in determinations of whether a nonattainment area has attained one of these NAAQS.
              (f) Prior approval from EPA is not required for discontinuance of an SPM.

              § 58.30
              Special considerations for data comparisons to the NAAQS.
              (a) Comparability of PM 2.5
                data. The primary and secondary annual and 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS are described in part 50 of this chapter. Monitors that follow the network technical requirements specified in § 58.11 are eligible for comparison to the NAAQS subject to the additional requirements of this section. PM 2.5 measurement data from all eligible monitors are comparable to the 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. PM 2.5 measurement data from all eligible monitors that are representative of area-wide air quality are comparable to the annual PM 2.5 NAAQS. Consistent with appendix D to this part, section 4.7.1, when micro- or middle-scale PM 2.5 monitoring sites collectively identify a larger region of localized high ambient PM 2.5 concentrations, such sites would be considered representative of an area-wide location and, therefore, eligible for comparison to the annual PM 2.5 NAAQS. PM 2.5 measurement data from monitors that are not representative of area-wide air quality but rather of relatively unique micro-scale, or localized hot spot, or unique middle-scale impact sites are not eligible for comparison to the annual PM 2.5 NAAQS. PM 2.5 measurement data from these monitors are eligible for comparison to the 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. For example, if a micro- or middle-scale PM 2.5 monitoring site is adjacent to a unique dominating local PM 2.5 source, then the PM 2.5 measurement data from such a site would only be eligible for comparison to the 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. Approval of sites that are suitable and sites that are not suitable for comparison with the annual PM 2.5 NAAQS is provided for as part of the annual monitoring network plan described in § 58.10.

              2. Quality System Requirements
              3. Measurement Quality Check Requirements
              4. Calculations for Data Quality Assessments

              6. References
              1. General Information
              1.1 Applicability. (a) This appendix specifies the minimum quality system requirements applicable to SLAMS and other monitor types whose data are intended to be used to determine compliance with the NAAQS (e.g., SPMs, tribal, CASTNET, NCore, industrial, etc.), unless the EPA Regional Administrator has reviewed and approved the monitor for exclusion from NAAQS use and these quality assurance requirements.
              (b) Primary quality assurance organizations are encouraged to develop and maintain quality systems more extensive than the required minimums. Additional guidance for the requirements reflected in this appendix can be found in the “Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems,” Volume II (see reference 10 of this appendix) and at a national level in references 1, 2, and 3 of this appendix.
              1.2 Primary Quality Assurance Organization (PQAO). A PQAO is defined as a monitoring organization or a group of monitoring organizations or other organization that is responsible for a set of stations that monitors the same pollutant and for which data quality assessments will be pooled. Each criteria pollutant sampler/monitor must be associated with only one PQAO. In some cases, data quality is assessed at the PQAO level.
              1.2.1 Each PQAO shall be defined such that measurement uncertainty among all stations in the organization can be expected to be reasonably homogeneous as a result of common factors. Common factors that should be considered in defining PQAOs include:
              (a) Operation by a common team of field operators according to a common set of procedures;
              (b) Use of a common quality assurance project plan (QAPP) or standard operating procedures;
              (c) Common calibration facilities and standards;
              (d) Oversight by a common quality assurance organization; and
              (e) Support by a common management organization (i.e., state agency) or laboratory.
              Since data quality assessments are made and data certified at the PQAO level, the monitoring organization identified as the PQAO will be responsible for the oversight of the quality of data of all monitoring organizations within the PQAO.
              1.2.2 Monitoring organizations having difficulty describing its PQAO or in assigning specific monitors to primary quality assurance organizations should consult with the appropriate EPA Regional Office. Any consolidation of monitoring organizations to PQAOs shall be subject to final approval by the appropriate EPA Regional Office.
              1.2.3 Each PQAO is required to implement a quality system that provides sufficient information to assess the quality of the monitoring data. The quality system must, at a minimum, include the specific requirements described in this appendix. Failure to conduct or pass a required check or procedure, or a series of required checks or procedures, does not by itself invalidate data for regulatory decision making. Rather, PQAOs and the EPA shall use the checks and procedures required in this appendix in combination with other data quality information, reports, and similar documentation that demonstrate overall compliance with Part 58. Accordingly, the EPA and PQAOs shall use a “weight of evidence” approach when determining the suitability of data for regulatory decisions. The EPA reserves the authority to use or not use monitoring data submitted by a monitoring organization when making regulatory decisions based on the EPA's assessment of the quality of the data. Consensus built validation templates or validation criteria already approved in QAPPs should be used as the basis for the weight of evidence approach.
              1.3 Definitions.
              
              (a) Measurement Uncertainty. A term used to describe deviations from a true concentration or estimate that are related to the measurement process and not to spatial or temporal population attributes of the air being measured.
              
              (b) Precision. A measurement of mutual agreement among individual measurements of the same property usually under prescribed similar conditions, expressed generally in terms of the standard deviation.
              (c) Bias. The systematic or persistent distortion of a measurement process which causes errors in one direction.
              (d) Accuracy. The degree of agreement between an observed value and an accepted reference value. Accuracy includes a combination of random error (imprecision) and systematic error (bias) components which are due to sampling and analytical operations.
              (e) Completeness. A measure of the amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under correct, normal conditions.
              (f) Detection Limit. The lowest concentration or amount of target analyte that can be determined to be different from zero by a single measurement at a stated level of probability.
              1.4 Measurement Quality Checks. The measurement quality checks described in section 3 of this appendix shall be reported to AQS and are included in the data required for certification.
              1.5 Assessments and Reports. Periodic assessments and documentation of data quality are required to be reported to the EPA. To provide national uniformity in this assessment and reporting of data quality for all networks, specific assessment and reporting procedures are prescribed in detail in sections 3, 4, and 5 of this appendix. On the other hand, the selection and extent of the quality assurance and quality control activities used by a monitoring organization depend on a number of local factors such as field and laboratory conditions, the objectives for monitoring, the level of data quality needed, the expertise of assigned personnel, the cost of control procedures, pollutant concentration levels, etc. Therefore, quality system requirements in section 2 of this appendix are specified in general terms to allow each monitoring organization to develop a quality system that is most efficient and effective for its own circumstances while achieving the data quality objectives described in this appendix.
              2. Quality System Requirements
              A quality system (reference 1 of this appendix) is the means by which an organization manages the quality of the monitoring information it produces in a systematic, organized manner. It provides a framework for planning, implementing, assessing and reporting work performed by an organization and for carrying out required quality assurance and quality control activities.
              2.1 Quality Management Plans and Quality Assurance Project Plans. All PQAOs must develop a quality system that is described and approved in quality management plans (QMP) and QAPPs to ensure that the monitoring results:
              (a) Meet a well-defined need, use, or purpose (reference 5 of this appendix);
              (b) Provide data of adequate quality for the intended monitoring objectives;
              (c) Satisfy stakeholder expectations;
              (d) Comply with applicable standards specifications;
              (e) Comply with statutory (and other legal) requirements; and
              (f) Reflect consideration of cost and economics.
              2.1.1 The QMP describes the quality system in terms of the organizational structure, functional responsibilities of management and staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, implementing, assessing and reporting activities involving environmental data operations (EDO). The QMP must be suitably documented in accordance with EPA requirements (reference 2 of this appendix), and approved by the appropriate Regional Administrator, or his or her representative. The quality system described in the QMP will be reviewed during the systems audits described in section 2.5 of this appendix. Organizations that implement long-term monitoring programs with EPA funds should have a separate QMP document. Smaller organizations, organizations that do infrequent work with the EPA or have monitoring programs of limited size or scope may combine the QMP with the QAPP if approved by, and subject to any conditions of the EPA. Additional guidance on this process can be found in reference 10 of this appendix. Approval of the recipient's QMP by the appropriate Regional Administrator or his or her representative may allow delegation of authority to the PQAOs independent quality assurance function to review and approve environmental data collection activities adequately described and covered under the scope of the QMP and documented in appropriate planning documents (QAPP). Where a PQAO or monitoring organization has been delegated authority to review and approve their QAPP, an electronic copy must be submitted to the EPA region at the time it is submitted to the PQAO/monitoring organization's QAPP approving authority. The QAPP will be reviewed by the EPA during systems audits or circumstances related to data quality. The QMP submission and approval dates for PQAOs/monitoring organizations must be reported to AQS either by the monitoring organization or the EPA Region.

              2.1.2 The QAPP is a formal document describing, in sufficient detail, the quality system that must be implemented to ensure that the results of work performed will satisfy the stated objectives. PQAOs must develop QAPPs that describe how the organization intends to control measurement uncertainty to an appropriate level in order to achieve the data quality objectives for the EDO. The quality assurance policy of the EPA requires every EDO to have a written and approved QAPP prior to the start of the EDO. It is the responsibility of the PQAO/monitoring organization to adhere to this policy. The QAPP must be suitably documented in accordance with EPA requirements (reference 3 of this appendix) and include standard operating procedures for all EDOs either within the document or by appropriate reference. The QAPP must identify each PQAO operating monitors under the QAPP as well as generally identify the sites and monitors to which it is applicable either within the document or by appropriate reference. The QAPP submission and approval dates must be reported to AQS either by the monitoring organization or the EPA Region.
              2.1.3 The PQAO/monitoring organization's quality system must have adequate resources both in personnel and funding to plan, implement, assess and report on the achievement of the requirements of this appendix and it's approved QAPP.
              2.2 Independence of Quality Assurance. The PQAO must provide for a quality assurance management function, that aspect of the overall management system of the organization that determines and implements the quality policy defined in a PQAO's QMP. Quality management includes strategic planning, allocation of resources and other systematic planning activities (e.g., planning, implementation, assessing and reporting) pertaining to the quality system. The quality assurance management function must have sufficient technical expertise and management authority to conduct independent oversight and assure the implementation of the organization's quality system relative to the ambient air quality monitoring program and should be organizationally independent of environmental data generation activities.
              2.3. Data Quality Performance Requirements.
              
              2.3.1 Data Quality Objectives. The DQOs, or the results of other systematic planning processes, are statements that define the appropriate type of data to collect and specify the tolerable levels of potential decision errors that will be used as a basis for establishing the quality and quantity of data needed to support the monitoring objectives (reference 5 of this appendix). The DQOs will be developed by the EPA to support the primary regulatory objectives for each criteria pollutant. As they are developed, they will be added to the regulation. The quality of the conclusions derived from data interpretation can be affected by population uncertainty (spatial or temporal uncertainty) and measurement uncertainty (uncertainty associated with collecting, analyzing, reducing and reporting concentration data). This appendix focuses on assessing and controlling measurement uncertainty.
              2.3.1.1 Measurement Uncertainty for Automated and Manual PM
                2.5
                Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient of variation (CV) of 10 percent and ±10 percent for total bias.
              2.3.1.2 Measurement Uncertainty for Automated O
                3
                Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 7 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 7 percent.
              2.3.1.3 Measurement Uncertainty for Pb Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 20 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.
              2.3.1.4 Measurement Uncertainty for NO
                2. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 15 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.
              2.3.1.5 Measurement Uncertainty for SO
                2. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty for precision is defined as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 10 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 10 percent.
              2.4 National Performance Evaluation Programs. The PQAO shall provide for the implementation of a program of independent and adequate audits of all monitors providing data for NAAQS compliance purposes including the provision of adequate resources for such audit programs. A monitoring plan (or QAPP) which provides for PQAO participation in the EPA's National Performance Audit Program (NPAP), the PM2.5 Performance Evaluation Program (PM2.5-PEP) program and the Pb Performance Evaluation Program (Pb-PEP) and indicates the consent of the PQAO for the EPA to apply an appropriate portion of the grant funds, which the EPA would otherwise award to the PQAO for these QA activities, will be deemed by the EPA to meet this requirement. For clarification and to participate, PQAOs should contact either the appropriate EPA regional quality assurance (QA) coordinator at the appropriate EPA Regional Office location, or the NPAP coordinator at the EPA Air Quality Assessment Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The PQAOs that plan to implement these programs (self-implement) rather than use the federal programs must meet the adequacy requirements found in the appropriate sections that follow, as well as meet the definition of independent assessment that follows.
              
              2.4.1 Independent assessment. An assessment performed by a qualified individual, group, or organization that is not part of the organization directly performing and accountable for the work being assessed. This auditing organization must not be involved with the generation of the ambient air monitoring data. An organization can conduct the performance evaluation (PE) if it can meet this definition and has a management structure that, at a minimum, will allow for the separation of its routine sampling personnel from its auditing personnel by two levels of management. In addition, the sample analysis of audit filters must be performed by a laboratory facility and laboratory equipment separate from the facilities used for routine sample analysis. Field and laboratory personnel will be required to meet PE field and laboratory training and certification requirements to establish comparability to federally implemented programs.
              2.5 Technical Systems Audit Program. Technical systems audits of each PQAO shall be conducted at least every 3 years by the appropriate EPA Regional Office and reported to the AQS. If a PQAO is made up of more than one monitoring organization, all monitoring organizations in the PQAO should be audited within 6 years (two TSA cycles of the PQAO). As an example, if a state has five local monitoring organizations that are consolidated under one PQAO, all five local monitoring organizations should receive a technical systems audit within a 6-year period. Systems audit programs are described in reference 10 of this appendix.
              2.6 Gaseous and Flow Rate Audit Standards.
              

              2.6.1 Gaseous pollutant concentration standards (permeation devices or cylinders of compressed gas) used to obtain test concentrations for CO, SO2, NO, and NO2 must be traceable to either a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Traceable Reference Material (NTRM) or a NIST-certified Gas Manufacturer's Internal Standard (GMIS), certified in accordance with one of the procedures given in reference 4 of this appendix. Vendors advertising certification with the procedures provided in reference 4 of this appendix and distributing gases as “EPA Protocol Gas” for ambient air monitoring purposes must participate in the EPA Ambient Air Protocol Gas Verification Program or not use “EPA” in any form of advertising. Monitoring organizations must provide information to the EPA on the gas producers they use on an annual basis and those PQAOs purchasing standards will be obligated, at the request of the EPA, to participate in the program at least once every 5 years by sending a new unused standard to a designated verification laboratory.
              2.6.2 Test concentrations for O3 must be obtained in accordance with the ultraviolet photometric calibration procedure specified in appendix D to Part 50 of this chapter and by means of a certified NIST-traceable O3 transfer standard. Consult references 7 and 8 of this appendix for guidance on transfer standards for O3.
              2.6.3 Flow rate measurements must be made by a flow measuring instrument that is NIST-traceable to an authoritative volume or other applicable standard. Guidance for certifying some types of flowmeters is provided in reference 10 of this appendix.
              2.7 Primary Requirements and Guidance. Requirements and guidance documents for developing the quality system are contained in references 1 through 11 of this appendix, which also contain many suggested procedures, checks, and control specifications. Reference 10 describes specific guidance for the development of a quality system for data collected for comparison to the NAAQS. Many specific quality control checks and specifications for methods are included in the respective reference methods described in Part 50 of this chapter or in the respective equivalent method descriptions available from the EPA (reference 6 of this appendix). Similarly, quality control procedures related to specifically designated reference and equivalent method monitors are contained in the respective operation or instruction manuals associated with those monitors.
              3. Measurement Quality Check Requirements
              This section provides the requirements for PQAOs to perform the measurement quality checks that can be used to assess data quality. Data from these checks are required to be submitted to the AQS within the same time frame as routinely-collected ambient concentration data as described in 40 CFR 58.16. Table A-1 of this appendix provides a summary of the types and frequency of the measurement quality checks that will be described in this section.

                , O
                3
                , and CO.
              3.1.1 One-Point Quality Control (QC) Check for SO
                2, NO2, O3, and CO. (a) A one-point QC check must be performed at least once every 2 weeks on each automated monitor used to measure SO2, NO2, O3 and CO. With the advent of automated calibration systems, more frequent checking is strongly encouraged. See Reference 10 of this appendix for guidance on the review procedure. The QC check is made by challenging the monitor with a QC check gas of known concentration (effective concentration for open path monitors) between the prescribed range of 0.005 and 0.08 parts per million (ppm) for SO2, NO2, and O3, and between the prescribed range of 0.5 and 5 ppm for CO monitors. The QC check gas concentration selected within the prescribed range should be related to the monitoring objectives for the monitor. If monitoring at an NCore site or for trace level monitoring, the QC check concentration should be selected to represent the mean or median concentrations at the site. If the mean or median concentrations at trace gas sites are below the MDL of the instrument the agency can select the lowest concentration in the prescribed range that can be practically achieved. If the mean or median concentrations at trace gas sites are above the prescribed range the agency can select the highest concentration in the prescribed range. An additional QC check point is encouraged for those organizations that may have occasional high values or would like to confirm the monitors' linearity at the higher end of the operational range or around NAAQS concentrations. If monitoring for NAAQS decisions, the QC concentration can be selected at a higher concentration within the prescribed range but should also consider precision points around mean or median monitor concentrations.
              (b) Point analyzers must operate in their normal sampling mode during the QC check and the test atmosphere must pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable. The QC check must be conducted before any calibration or adjustment to the monitor.
              (c) Open path monitors are tested by inserting a test cell containing a QC check gas concentration into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the test, and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be altered as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the test. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentration of the QC check gas in the test cell must be selected to produce an effective concentration in the range specified earlier in this section. Generally, the QC test concentration measurement will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the QC test concentration. As such, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the QC test from the QC check gas concentration measurement. If the difference between these before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas, discard the test result and repeat the test. If possible, open path monitors should be tested during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady.
              (d) Report the audit concentration of the QC gas and the corresponding measured concentration indicated by the monitor to AQS. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the precision and bias of the monitoring data as described in sections 4.1.2 (precision) and 4.1.3 (bias) of this appendix.
              3.1.2 Annual performance evaluation for SO

                2, O
                3
                , or CO. A performance evaluation must be conducted on each primary monitor once a year. This can be accomplished by evaluating 25 percent of the primary monitors each quarter. The evaluation should be conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine site operator.
              3.1.2.1 The evaluation is made by challenging the monitor with audit gas standards of known concentration from at least three audit levels. One point must be within two to three times the method detection limit of the instruments within the PQAOs network, the second point will be less than or equal to the 99th percentile of the data at the site or the network of sites in the PQAO or the next highest audit concentration level. The third point can be around the primary NAAQS or the highest 3-year concentration at the site or the network of sites in the PQAO. An additional 4th level is encouraged for those agencies that would like to confirm the monitors' linearity at the higher end of the operational range. In rare circumstances, there may be sites measuring concentrations above audit level 10. Notify the appropriate EPA region and the AQS program in order to make accommodations for auditing at levels above level 10.

              3.1.2.2 The NO2 audit techniques may vary depending on the ambient monitoring method. For chemiluminescence-type NO2 analyzers, gas phase titration (GPT) techniques should be based on EPA guidance documents and monitoring agency experience. The NO2 gas standards may be more appropriate than GPT for direct NO2 methods that do not employ converters. Care should be taken to ensure the stability of such gas standards prior to use.
              3.1.2.3 The standards from which audit gas test concentrations are obtained must meet the specifications of section 2.6.1 of this appendix. The gas standards and equipment used for the performance evaluation must not be the same as the standards and equipment used for one-point QC, calibrations, span evaluations or NPAP.
              3.1.2.4 For point analyzers, the evaluation shall be carried out by allowing the monitor to analyze the audit gas test atmosphere in its normal sampling mode such that the test atmosphere passes through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other sample inlet components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable.
              3.1.2.5 Open-path monitors are evaluated by inserting a test cell containing the various audit gas concentrations into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and, as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the evaluation, and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be modified as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the evaluation. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentrations of the audit gas in the test cell must be selected to produce effective concentrations in the evaluation level ranges specified in this section of this appendix. Generally, each evaluation concentration measurement result will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the evaluation test concentration. As such, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the evaluation test (or preferably before and after each evaluation concentration level) from the evaluation concentration measurement. If the difference between the before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas standard, discard the test result for that concentration level and repeat the test for that level. If possible, open path monitors should be evaluated during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady. Also, if the open-path instrument is not installed in a permanent manner, the monitoring path length must be reverified to be within ±3 percent to validate the evaluation since the monitoring path length is critical to the determination of the effective concentration.
              3.1.2.6 Report both the evaluation concentrations (effective concentrations for open-path monitors) of the audit gases and the corresponding measured concentration (corrected concentrations, if applicable, for open path monitors) indicated or produced by the monitor being tested to AQS. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the quality of the monitoring data as described in section 4.1.1 of this appendix.
              3.1.3 National Performance Audit Program (NPAP).
              
              The NPAP is a performance evaluation which is a type of audit where quantitative data are collected independently in order to evaluate the proficiency of an analyst, monitoring instrument or laboratory. Due to the implementation approach used in the program, NPAP provides a national independent assessment of performance while maintaining a consistent level of data quality. Details of the program can be found in reference 11 of this appendix. The program requirements include:
              3.1.3.1 Performing audits of the primary monitors at 20 percent of monitoring sites per year, and 100 percent of the sites every 6 years. High-priority sites may be audited more frequently. Since not all gaseous criteria pollutants are monitored at every site within a PQAO, it is not required that 20 percent of the primary monitors for each pollutant receive an NPAP audit each year only that 20 percent of the PQAOs monitoring sites receive an NPAP audit. It is expected that over the 6-year period all primary monitors for all gaseous pollutants will receive an NPAP audit.

              3.1.3.2 Developing a delivery system that will allow for the audit concentration gasses to be introduced to the probe inlet where logistically feasible.
              

              3.1.3.3 Using audit gases that are verified against the NIST standard reference methods or special review procedures and validated annually for CO, SO2 and NO2, and at the beginning of each quarter of audits for O3.
              3.1.3.4 As described in section 2.4 of this appendix, the PQAO may elect, on an annual basis, to utilize the federally implemented NPAP program. If the PQAO plans to self-implement NPAP, the EPA will establish training and other technical requirements for PQAOs to establish comparability to federally implemented programs. In addition to meeting the requirements in sections 3.1.3.1 through 3.1.3.3 of this appendix, the PQAO must:
              (a) Utilize an audit system equivalent to the federally implemented NPAP audit system and is separate from equipment used in annual performance evaluations.
              (b) Perform a whole system check by having the NPAP system tested against an independent and qualified EPA lab, or equivalent.
              (c) Evaluate the system with the EPA NPAP program through collocated auditing at an acceptable number of sites each year (at least one for an agency network of five or less sites; at least two for a network with more than five sites).
              (d) Incorporate the NPAP in the PQAO's quality assurance project plan.
              (e) Be subject to review by independent, EPA-trained personnel.
              (f) Participate in initial and update training/certification sessions.
              3.1.3.5 OAQPS, in consultation with the relevant EPA Regional Office, may approve the PQAO's plan to self-implement NPAP if the OAQPS determines that the PQAO's self-implementation plan is equivalent to the federal programs and adequate to meet the objectives of national consistency and data quality.
              3.2 PM
                2.5.
              3.2.1 Flow Rate Verification for PM
                2.5. A one-point flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month (each verification minimally separated by 14 days) on each monitor used to measure PM2.5. The verification is made by checking the operational flow rate of the monitor. If the verification is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made prior to such flow rate adjustment. For the standard procedure, use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the monitor's normal flow rate. Care should be used in selecting and using the flow rate measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Report the flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured by the monitor to AQS. The percent differences between the audit and measured flow rates are used to assess the bias of the monitoring data as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (using flow rates in lieu of concentrations).
              3.2.2 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for PM
                2.5. Audit the flow rate of the particulate monitor twice a year. The two audits should ideally be spaced between 5 and 7 months apart. The EPA strongly encourages more frequent auditing. The audit should (preferably) be conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine site operator. The audit is made by measuring the monitor's normal operating flow rate(s) using a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used for verifications or to calibrate the monitor. However, both the calibration standard and the audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume standard. Care must be taken in auditing the flow rate to be certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Report the audit flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured by the monitor to AQS. The percent differences between these flow rates are used to evaluate monitor performance.
              3.2.3 Collocated Quality Control Sampling Procedures for PM
                2.5. For each pair of collocated monitors, designate one sampler as the primary monitor whose concentrations will be used to report air quality for the site, and designate the other as the quality control monitor. There can be only one primary monitor at a monitoring site for a given time period.
              3.2.3.1 For each distinct monitoring method designation (FRM or FEM) that a PQAO is using for a primary monitor, the PQAO must have 15 percent of the primary monitors of each method designation collocated (values of 0.5 and greater round up); and have at least one collocated quality control monitor (if the total number of monitors is less than three). The first collocated monitor must be a designated FRM monitor.
              3.2.3.2 In addition, monitors selected for collocation must also meet the following requirements:
              (a) A primary monitor designated as an EPA FRM shall be collocated with a quality control monitor having the same EPA FRM method designation.

              (b) For each primary monitor designated as an EPA FEM used by the PQAO, 50 percent of the monitors designated for collocation, or the first if only one collocation is necessary, shall be collocated with a FRM quality control monitor and 50 percent of the monitors shall be collocated with a monitor having the same method designation as the FEM primary monitor. If an odd number of collocated monitors is required, the additional monitor shall be a FRM quality control monitor. An example of the distribution of collocated monitors for each unique FEM is provided below. Table A-2 of this appendix demonstrates the collocation procedure with a PQAO having one type of primary FRM and multiple primary FEMs.

              3.2.3.3 Since the collocation requirements are used to assess precision of the primary monitors and there can only be one primary monitor at a monitoring site, a site can only count for the collocation of the method designation of the primary monitor at that site.
              3.2.3.4 The collocated monitors should be deployed according to the following protocol:
              (a) Fifty percent of the collocated quality control monitors should be deployed at sites with annual average or daily concentrations estimated to be within plus or minus 20 percent of either the annual or 24-hour NAAQS and the remainder at the PQAOs discretion;
              (b) If an organization has no sites with annual average or daily concentrations within ±20 percent of the annual NAAQS or 24-hour NAAQS, 50 percent of the collocated quality control monitors should be deployed at those sites with the annual mean concentrations or 24-hour concentrations among the highest for all sites in the network and the remainder at the PQAOs discretion.
              (c) The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters (inlet to inlet) of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. A waiver allowing up to 10 meters horizontal distance and up to 3 meters vertical distance (inlet to inlet) between a primary and collocated sampler may be approved by the Regional Administrator for sites at a neighborhood or larger scale of representation during the annual network plan approval process. Sampling and analytical methodologies must be the consistently implemented for both primary and collocated quality control samplers and for all other samplers in the network.
              (d) Sample the collocated quality control monitor on a 1-in-12 day schedule. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated quality control monitors at each collocated sampling site to AQS. The calculations for evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors are described in section 4.2.1 of this appendix.
              3.2.4 PM
                2.5
                Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) Procedures. The PEP is an independent assessment used to estimate total measurement system bias. These evaluations will be performed under the NPEP as described in section 2.4 of this appendix or a comparable program. Performance evaluations will be performed annually within each PQAO. For PQAOs with less than or equal to five monitoring sites, five valid performance evaluation audits must be collected and reported each year. For PQAOs with greater than five monitoring sites, eight valid performance evaluation audits must be collected and reported each year. A valid performance evaluation audit means that both the primary monitor and PEP audit concentrations are valid and above 3 µg/m3. Siting of the PEP monitor must be consistent with section 3.2.3.4(c). However, any horizontal distance greater than 4 meters and any vertical distance greater than one meter must be reported to the EPA regional PEP coordinator. Additionally for every monitor designated as a primary monitor, a primary quality assurance organization must:
              3.2.4.1 Have each method designation evaluated each year; and,
              3.2.4.2 Have all FRM, FEM or ARM samplers subject to a PEP audit at least once every 6 years, which equates to approximately 15 percent of the monitoring sites audited each year.

              3.2.4.3. Additional information concerning the PEP is contained in reference 10 of this appendix. The calculations for evaluating bias between the primary monitor and the performance evaluation monitor for PM2.5 are described in section 4.2.5 of this appendix.

                10
                Low Volume Samplers (less than 200 liter/minute). A one-point flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month (each verification minimally separated by 14 days) on each monitor used to measure PM10. The verification is made by checking the operational flow rate of the monitor. If the verification is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made prior to such flow rate adjustment. For the standard procedure, use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the monitor's normal flow rate. Care should be taken in selecting and using the flow rate measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. The percent differences between the audit and measured flow rates are reported to AQS and used to assess the bias of the monitoring data as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (using flow rates in lieu of concentrations).

                10
                High Volume Samplers (greater than 200 liters/minute). For PM10 high volume samplers, the verification frequency is one verification every 90 days (quarter) with 4 in a year. Other than verification frequency, follow the same technical procedure as described in section 3.3.1 of this appendix.
              3.3.3 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for PM
                10. Audit the flow rate of the particulate monitor twice a year. The two audits should ideally be spaced between 5 and 7 months apart. The EPA strongly encourages more frequent auditing. The audit should (preferably) be conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine site operator. The audit is made by measuring the monitor's normal operating flow rate using a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used for verifications or to calibrate the monitor. However, both the calibration standard and the audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume standard. Care must be taken in auditing the flow rate to be certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Report the audit flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured by the monitor to AQS. The percent differences between these flow rates are used to evaluate monitor performance.
              3.3.4 Collocated Quality Control Sampling Procedures for Manual PM
                10. Collocated sampling for PM10 is only required for manual samplers. For each pair of collocated monitors, designate one sampler as the primary monitor whose concentrations will be used to report air quality for the site and designate the other as the quality control monitor.
              3.3.4.1 For manual PM10 samplers, a PQAO must:
              (a) Have 15 percent of the primary monitors collocated (values of 0.5 and greater round up); and
              (b) Have at least one collocated quality control monitor (if the total number of monitors is less than three).
              3.3.4.2 The collocated quality control monitors should be deployed according to the following protocol:
              (a) Fifty percent of the collocated quality control monitors should be deployed at sites with daily concentrations estimated to be within plus or minus 20 percent of the applicable NAAQS and the remainder at the PQAOs discretion;
              (b) If an organization has no sites with daily concentrations within plus or minus 20 percent of the NAAQS, 50 percent of the collocated quality control monitors should be deployed at those sites with the daily mean concentrations among the highest for all sites in the network and the remainder at the PQAOs discretion.
              (c) The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters (inlet to inlet) of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. A waiver allowing up to 10 meters horizontal distance and up to 3 meters vertical distance (inlet to inlet) between a primary and collocated sampler may be approved by the Regional Administrator for sites at a neighborhood or larger scale of representation. This waiver may be approved during the annual network plan approval process. Sampling and analytical methodologies must be the consistently implemented for both collocated samplers and for all other samplers in the network.
              (d) Sample the collocated quality control monitor on a 1-in-12 day schedule. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated quality control monitors at each collocated sampling site to AQS. The calculations for evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors are described in section 4.2.1 of this appendix.

              (e) In determining the number of collocated quality control sites required for PM10, monitoring networks for lead (Pb-PM10) should be treated independently from networks for particulate matter (PM), even though the separate networks may share one or more common samplers. However, a single quality control monitor that meets the collocation requirements for Pb-PM10 and PM10 may serve as a collocated quality control monitor for both networks. Extreme care must be taken when using the filter from a quality control monitor for both PM10 and Pb analysis. A PM10 filter weighing should occur prior to any Pb analysis.
              3.4 Pb.
              
              3.4.1 Flow Rate Verification for Pb-PM
                10
                Low Volume Samplers (less than 200 liter/minute). A one-point flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month (each verification minimally separated by 14 days) on each monitor used to measure Pb. The verification is made by checking the operational flow rate of the monitor. If the verification is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made prior to such flow rate adjustment. For the standard procedure, use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the monitor's normal flow rate. Care should be taken in selecting and using the flow rate measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. The percent differences between the audit and measured flow rates are reported to AQS and used to assess the bias of the monitoring data as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (using flow rates in lieu of concentrations).
              3.4.2 Flow Rate Verification for Pb High Volume Samplers (greater than 200 liters/minute). For high volume samplers, the verification frequency is one verification every 90 days (quarter) with four in a year. Other than verification frequency, follow the same technical procedure as described in section 3.4.1 of this appendix.
              3.4.3 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for Pb. Audit the flow rate of the particulate monitor twice a year. The two audits should ideally be spaced between 5 and 7 months apart. The EPA strongly encourages more frequent auditing. The audit should (preferably) be conducted by a trained experienced technician other than the routine site operator. The audit is made by measuring the monitor's normal operating flow rate using a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used for verifications or to calibrate the monitor. However, both the calibration standard and the audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume standard. Care must be taken in auditing the flow rate to be certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Report the audit flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured by the monitor to AQS. The percent differences between these flow rates are used to evaluate monitor performance.
              3.4.4 Collocated Quality Control Sampling for TSP Pb for monitoring sites other than non-source oriented NCore. For each pair of collocated monitors for manual TSP Pb samplers, designate one sampler as the primary monitor whose concentrations will be used to report air quality for the site, and designate the other as the quality control monitor.
              3.4.4.1 A PQAO must:
              (a) Have 15 percent of the primary monitors (not counting non-source oriented NCore sites in PQAO) collocated. Values of 0.5 and greater round up; and
              (b) Have at least one collocated quality control monitor (if the total number of monitors is less than three).
              3.4.4.2 The collocated quality control monitors should be deployed according to the following protocol:
              (a) The first collocated Pb site selected must be the site measuring the highest Pb concentrations in the network. If the site is impractical, alternative sites, approved by the EPA Regional Administrator, may be selected. If additional collocated sites are necessary, collocated sites may be chosen that reflect average ambient air Pb concentrations in the network.
              (b) The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters (inlet to inlet) of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference.
              (c) Sample the collocated quality control monitor on a 1-in-12 day schedule. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated quality control monitors at each collocated sampling site to AQS. The calculations for evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors are described in section 4.2.1 of this appendix.
              3.4.5 Collocated Quality Control Sampling for Pb-PM10 at monitoring sites other than non-source oriented NCore. If a PQAO is monitoring for Pb-PM10 at sites other than at a non-source oriented NCore site then the PQAO must:
              3.4.5.1 Have 15 percent of the primary monitors (not counting non-source oriented NCore sites in PQAO) collocated. Values of 0.5 and greater round up; and
              3.4.5.2 Have at least one collocated quality control monitor (if the total number of monitors is less than three).
              3.4.5.3 The collocated monitors should be deployed according to the following protocol:
              (a) Fifty percent of the collocated quality control monitors should be deployed at sites with the highest 3-month average concentrations and the remainder at the PQAOs discretion.
              (b) The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters (inlet to inlet) of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. A waiver allowing up to 10 meters horizontal distance and up to 3 meters vertical distance (inlet to inlet) between a primary and collocated sampler may be approved by the Regional Administrator for sites at a neighborhood or larger scale of representation. This waiver may be approved during the annual network plan approval process. Sampling and analytical methodologies must be the consistently implemented for both collocated samplers and for all other samplers in the network.
              (c) Sample the collocated quality control monitor on a 1-in-12 day schedule. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated quality control monitors at each collocated sampling site to AQS. The calculations for evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors are described in section 4.2.1 of this appendix.

              (d) In determining the number of collocated quality control sites required for Pb-PM10, monitoring networks for PM10 should be treated independently from networks for Pb-PM10, even though the separate networks may share one or more common samplers. However, a single quality control monitor that meets the collocation requirements for Pb-PM10 and PM10 may serve as a collocated quality control monitor for both networks. Extreme care must be taken when using a using the filter from a quality control monitor for both PM10 and Pb analysis. A PM10 filter weighing should occur prior to any Pb analysis.
              3.4.6 Pb Analysis Audits. Each calendar quarter, audit the Pb reference or equivalent method analytical procedure using filters containing a known quantity of Pb. These audit filters are prepared by depositing a Pb standard on unexposed filters and allowing them to dry thoroughly. The audit samples must be prepared using batches of reagents different from those used to calibrate the Pb analytical equipment being audited. Prepare audit samples in the following concentration ranges:
              
                
                  Range
                  Equivalent ambient Pbconcentration, µg/m 3
                    
                  
                
                
                  1
                  30-100% of Pb NAAQS.
                
                
                  2
                  200-300% of Pb NAAQS.
                
              
              (a) Extract the audit samples using the same extraction procedure used for exposed filters.
              (b) Analyze three audit samples in each of the two ranges each quarter samples are analyzed. The audit sample analyses shall be distributed as much as possible over the entire calendar quarter.
              (c) Report the audit concentrations (in µg Pb/filter or strip) and the corresponding measured concentrations (in µg Pb/filter or strip) to AQS using AQS unit code 077. The percent differences between the concentrations are used to calculate analytical accuracy as described in section 4.2.6 of this appendix.
              3.4.7 Pb PEP Procedures for monitoring sites other than non-source oriented NCore. The PEP is an independent assessment used to estimate total measurement system bias. These evaluations will be performed under the NPEP described in section 2.4 of this appendix or a comparable program. Each year, one performance evaluation audit must be performed at one Pb site in each primary quality assurance organization that has less than or equal to five sites and two audits at PQAOs with greater than five sites. Non-source oriented NCore sites are not counted. Siting of the PEP monitor must be consistent with section 3.4.5.3(b). However, any horizontal distance greater than 4 meters and any vertical distance greater than 1 meter must be reported to the EPA regional PEP coordinator. In addition, each year, four collocated samples from PQAOs with less than or equal to five sites and six collocated samples at PQAOs with greater than five sites must be sent to an independent laboratory, the same laboratory as the performance evaluation audit, for analysis. The calculations for evaluating bias between the primary monitor and the performance evaluation monitor for Pb are described in section 4.2.4 of this appendix.
              4. Calculations for Data Quality Assessments
              (a) Calculations of measurement uncertainty are carried out by the EPA according to the following procedures. The PQAOs must report the data to AQS for all measurement quality checks as specified in this appendix even though they may elect to perform some or all of the calculations in this section on their own.

              (b) The EPA will provide annual assessments of data quality aggregated by site and PQAO for SO2, NO2, O3 and CO and by PQAO for PM10, PM2.5, and Pb.
              (c) At low concentrations, agreement between the measurements of collocated quality control samplers, expressed as relative percent difference or percent difference, may be relatively poor. For this reason, collocated measurement pairs are selected for use in the precision and bias calculations only when both measurements are equal to or above the following limits:
              (1) Pb: 0.002 µg/m3 (Methods approved after 3/04/2010, with exception of manual equivalent method EQLA-0813-803).
              (2) Pb: 0.02 µg/m3 (Methods approved before 3/04/2010, and manual equivalent method EQLA-0813-803).
              (3) PM10 (Hi-Vol): 15 µg/m3.
              (4) PM10 (Lo-Vol): 3 µg/m3.
              (5) PM2.5: 3 µg/m3.
              4.1 Statistics for the Assessment of QC Checks for SO2, NO2, O3 and CO.
              4.1.1 Percent Difference. Many of the measurement quality checks start with a comparison of an audit concentration or value (flow rate) to the concentration/value measured by the monitor and use percent difference as the comparison statistic as described in equation 1 of this section. For each single point check, calculate the percent difference, d
                i, as follows:
              
                
                ER28MR16.000
              
              where meas is the concentration indicated by the PQAO's instrument and audit is the audit concentration of the standard used in the QC check being measured.
              4.1.2 Precision Estimate. The precision estimate is used to assess the one-point QC checks for SO2, NO2, O3, or CO described in section 3.1.1 of this appendix. The precision estimator is the coefficient of variation upper bound and is calculated using equation 2 of this section:
              
                ER28MR16.001
              
              where n is the number of single point checks being aggregated; X2
                0.1,n-1 is the 10th percentile of a chi-squared distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.
              4.1.3 Bias Estimate. The bias estimate is calculated using the one-point QC checks for SO2, NO2, O3, or CO described in section 3.1.1 of this appendix. The bias estimator is an upper bound on the mean absolute value of the percent differences as described in equation 3 of this section:
              
                ER28MR16.002
              
              where n is the number of single point checks being aggregated; t0.95,n-1 is the 95th quantile of a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom; the quantity AB is the mean of the absolute values of the d
                i ′ s and is calculated using equation 4 of this section:
              
                ER28MR16.003
              
              and the quantity AS is the standard deviation of the absolute value of the d
                i ′ s and is calculated using equation 5 of this section:
              
                
                ER28MR16.004
              
              4.1.3.1 Assigning a sign (positive/negative) to the bias estimate. Since the bias statistic as calculated in equation 3 of this appendix uses absolute values, it does not have a tendency (negative or positive bias) associated with it. A sign will be designated by rank ordering the percent differences of the QC check samples from a given site for a particular assessment interval.
              4.1.3.2 Calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles of the percent differences for each site. The absolute bias upper bound should be flagged as positive if both percentiles are positive and negative if both percentiles are negative. The absolute bias upper bound would not be flagged if the 25th and 75th percentiles are of different signs.
              4.2 Statistics for the Assessment of PM10, PM2.5, and Pb.
              4.2.1 Collocated Quality Control Sampler Precision Estimate for
                PM
                10,
                PM
                2.5
                and Pb. Precision is estimated via duplicate measurements from collocated samplers. It is recommended that the precision be aggregated at the PQAO level quarterly, annually, and at the 3-year level. The data pair would only be considered valid if both concentrations are greater than or equal to the minimum values specified in section 4(c) of this appendix. For each collocated data pair, calculate the relative percent difference, d
                i, using equation 6 of this appendix:
              
                ER28MR16.005
              
              where X
                i is the concentration from the primary sampler and Y
                i is the concentration value from the audit sampler. The coefficient of variation upper bound is calculated using equation 7 of this appendix:
              
                ER28MR16.006
              
              where n is the number of valid data pairs being aggregated, and X2
                0.1,n-1 is the 10th percentile of a chi-squared distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. The factor of 2 in the denominator adjusts for the fact that each d
                i is calculated from two values with error.
              4.2.2 One-Point Flow Rate Verification Bias Estimate for
                PM
                10,
                PM
                2.5
                and Pb. For each one-point flow rate verification, calculate the percent difference in volume using equation 1 of this appendix where meas is the value indicated by the sampler's volume measurement and audit is the actual volume indicated by the auditing flow meter. The absolute volume bias upper bound is then calculated using equation 3, where n is the number of flow rate audits being aggregated; t0.95,n-1 is the 95th quantile of a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, the quantity AB is the mean of the absolute values of the d
                i′s and is calculated using equation 4 of this appendix, and the quantity AS in equation 3 of this appendix is the standard deviation of the absolute values if the d
                i′s and is calculated using equation 5 of this appendix.
              4.2.3 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit Bias Estimate for
                PM
                10,
                PM
                2.5
                and Pb. Use the same procedure described in section 4.2.2 for the evaluation of flow rate audits.
              4.2.4 Performance Evaluation Programs Bias Estimate for Pb. The Pb bias estimate is calculated using the paired routine and the PEP monitor as described in section 3.4.7. Use the same procedures as described in section 4.1.3 of this appendix.
              4.2.5 Performance Evaluation Programs Bias Estimate for PM
                2.5. The bias estimate is calculated using the PEP audits described in section 4.1.3 of this appendix. The bias estimator is based on the mean percent differences (Equation 1). The mean percent difference, D, is calculated by Equation 8 below.
              
                ER28MR16.007
              
              where nj is the number of pairs and d1,d2,...dnj are the biases for each pair to be averaged.
              4.2.6 Pb Analysis Audit Bias Estimate. The bias estimate is calculated using the analysis audit data described in section 3.4.6. Use the same bias estimate procedure as described in section 4.1.3 of this appendix.
              5. Reporting Requirements
              5.1 Reporting Requirements. For each pollutant, prepare a list of all monitoring sites and their AQS site identification codes in each PQAO and submit the list to the appropriate EPA Regional Office, with a copy to AQS. Whenever there is a change in this list of monitoring sites in a PQAO, report this change to the EPA Regional Office and to AQS.
              5.1.1 Quarterly Reports. For each quarter, each PQAO shall report to AQS directly (or via the appropriate EPA Regional Office for organizations not direct users of AQS) the results of all valid measurement quality checks it has carried out during the quarter. The quarterly reports must be submitted consistent with the data reporting requirements specified for air quality data as set forth in 40 CFR 58.16. The EPA strongly encourages early submission of the quality assurance data in order to assist the PQAOs ability to control and evaluate the quality of the ambient air data.
              5.1.2 Annual Reports.
              
              5.1.2.1 When the PQAO has certified relevant data for the calendar year, the EPA will calculate and report the measurement uncertainty for the entire calendar year.

              1. General Information
              1.1 Applicability.
              
              (a) This appendix specifies the minimum quality assurance requirements for the control and assessment of the quality of the ambient air monitoring data submitted to a PSD reviewing authority or the EPA by an organization operating an air monitoring station, or network of stations, operated in order to comply with Part 51 New Source Review—Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD). Such organizations are encouraged to develop and maintain quality assurance programs more extensive than the required minimum. Additional guidance for the requirements reflected in this appendix can be found in the “Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems,” Volume II (Ambient Air) and “Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems,” Volume IV (Meteorological Measurements) and at a national level in references 1, 2, and 3 of this appendix.

              (b) It is not assumed that data generated for PSD under this appendix will be used in making NAAQS decisions. However, if all the requirements in this appendix are followed (including the NPEP programs) and reported to AQS, with review and concurrence from the EPA region, data may be used for NAAQS decisions. With the exception of the NPEP programs (NPAP, PM2.5 PEP, Pb-PEP), for which implementation is at the discretion of the PSD reviewing authority, all other quality assurance and quality control requirements found in the appendix must be met.
              1.2 PSD Primary Quality Assurance Organization (PQAO). A PSD PQAO is defined as a monitoring organization or a coordinated aggregation of such organizations that is responsible for a set of stations within one PSD reviewing authority that monitors the same pollutant and for which data quality assessments will be pooled. Each criteria pollutant sampler/monitor must be associated with only one PSD PQAO.
              1.2.1 Each PSD PQAO shall be defined such that measurement uncertainty among all stations in the organization can be expected to be reasonably homogeneous, as a result of common factors. A PSD PQAO must be associated with only one PSD reviewing authority. Common factors that should be considered in defining PSD PQAOs include:
              (a) Operation by a common team of field operators according to a common set of procedures;
              (b) Use of a common QAPP and/or standard operating procedures;
              (c) Common calibration facilities and standards;
              (d) Oversight by a common quality assurance organization; and
              (e) Support by a common management organization or laboratory.
              1.2.2 PSD monitoring organizations having difficulty describing its PQAO or in assigning specific monitors to a PSD PQAO should consult with the PSD reviewing authority. Any consolidation of PSD PQAOs shall be subject to final approval by the PSD reviewing authority.
              1.2.3 Each PSD PQAO is required to implement a quality system that provides sufficient information to assess the quality of the monitoring data. The quality system must, at a minimum, include the specific requirements described in this appendix. Failure to conduct or pass a required check or procedure, or a series of required checks or procedures, does not by itself invalidate data for regulatory decision making. Rather, PSD PQAOs and the PSD reviewing authority shall use the checks and procedures required in this appendix in combination with other data quality information, reports, and similar documentation that demonstrate overall compliance with parts 51, 52 and 58 of this chapter. Accordingly, the PSD reviewing authority shall use a “weight of evidence” approach when determining the suitability of data for regulatory decisions. The PSD reviewing authority reserves the authority to use or not use monitoring data submitted by a PSD monitoring organization when making regulatory decisions based on the PSD reviewing authority's assessment of the quality of the data. Generally, consensus built validation templates or validation criteria already approved in quality assurance project plans (QAPPs) should be used as the basis for the weight of evidence approach.
              1.3 Definitions.
              
              (a) Measurement Uncertainty. A term used to describe deviations from a true concentration or estimate that are related to the measurement process and not to spatial or temporal population attributes of the air being measured.
              (b) Precision. A measurement of mutual agreement among individual measurements of the same property usually under prescribed similar conditions, expressed generally in terms of the standard deviation.
              (c) Bias. The systematic or persistent distortion of a measurement process which causes errors in one direction.
              (d) Accuracy. The degree of agreement between an observed value and an accepted reference value. Accuracy includes a combination of random error (imprecision) and systematic error (bias) components which are due to sampling and analytical operations.
              (e) Completeness. A measure of the amount of valid data obtained from a measurement system compared to the amount that was expected to be obtained under correct, normal conditions.
              (f) Detectability. The low critical range value of a characteristic that a method specific procedure can reliably discern.
              1.4 Measurement Quality Check Reporting. The measurement quality checks described in section 3 of this appendix, are required to be submitted to the PSD reviewing authority within the same time frame as routinely-collected ambient concentration data as described in 40 CFR 58.16. The PSD reviewing authority may as well require that the measurement quality check data be reported to AQS.
              1.5 Assessments and Reports. Periodic assessments and documentation of data quality are required to be reported to the PSD reviewing authority. To provide national uniformity in this assessment and reporting of data quality for all networks, specific assessment and reporting procedures are prescribed in detail in sections 3, 4, and 5 of this appendix.
              2. Quality System Requirements
              A quality system (reference 1 of this appendix) is the means by which an organization manages the quality of the monitoring information it produces in a systematic, organized manner. It provides a framework for planning, implementing, assessing and reporting work performed by an organization and for carrying out required quality assurance and quality control activities.
              2.1 Quality Assurance Project Plans. All PSD PQAOs must develop a quality system that is described and approved in quality assurance project plans (QAPP) to ensure that the monitoring results:
              
              (a) Meet a well-defined need, use, or purpose (reference 5 of this appendix);
              (b) Provide data of adequate quality for the intended monitoring objectives;
              (c) Satisfy stakeholder expectations;
              (d) Comply with applicable standards specifications;
              (e) Comply with statutory (and other legal) requirements; and
              (f) Assure quality assurance and quality control adequacy and independence.
              2.1.1 The QAPP is a formal document that describes these activities in sufficient detail and is supported by standard operating procedures. The QAPP must describe how the organization intends to control measurement uncertainty to an appropriate level in order to achieve the objectives for which the data are collected. The QAPP must be documented in accordance with EPA requirements (reference 3 of this appendix).
              2.1.2 The PSD PQAO's quality system must have adequate resources both in personnel and funding to plan, implement, assess and report on the achievement of the requirements of this appendix and it's approved QAPP.
              2.1.3 Incorporation of quality management plan (QMP) elements into the QAPP. The QMP describes the quality system in terms of the organizational structure, functional responsibilities of management and staff, lines of authority, and required interfaces for those planning, implementing, assessing and reporting activities involving environmental data operations (EDO). The PSD PQAOs may combine pertinent elements of the QMP into the QAPP rather than requiring the submission of both QMP and QAPP documents separately, with prior approval of the PSD reviewing authority. Additional guidance on QMPs can be found in reference 2 of this appendix.

              2.2 Independence of Quality Assurance Management. The PSD PQAO must provide for a quality assurance management function for its PSD data collection operation, that aspect of the overall management system of the organization that determines and implements the quality policy defined in a PSD PQAO's QAPP. Quality management includes strategic planning, allocation of resources and other systematic planning activities (e.g., planning, implementation, assessing and reporting) pertaining to the quality system. The quality assurance management function must have sufficient technical expertise and management authority to conduct independent oversight and assure the implementation of the organization's quality system relative to the ambient air quality monitoring program and should be organizationally independent of environmental data generation activities.
              2.3 Data Quality Performance Requirements.
              
              2.3.1 Data Quality Objectives (DQOs). The DQOs, or the results of other systematic planning processes, are statements that define the appropriate type of data to collect and specify the tolerable levels of potential decision errors that will be used as a basis for establishing the quality and quantity of data needed to support air monitoring objectives (reference 5 of the appendix). The DQOs have been developed by the EPA to support attainment decisions for comparison to national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). The PSD reviewing authority and the PSD monitoring organization will be jointly responsible for determining whether adherence to the EPA developed NAAQS DQOs specified in appendix A of this part are appropriate or if DQOs from a project-specific systematic planning process are necessary.
              2.3.1.1 Measurement Uncertainty for Automated and Manual PM
                2.5
                Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty for precision is defined as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the coefficient of variation (CV) of 10 percent and plus or minus 10 percent for total bias.
              2.3.1.2 Measurement Uncertainty for Automated Ozone Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 7 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 7 percent.
              2.3.1.3 Measurement Uncertainty for Pb Methods. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 20 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.
              2.3.1.4 Measurement Uncertainty for NO
                2. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty is defined for precision as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 15 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 15 percent.
              2.3.1.5 Measurement Uncertainty for SO
                2. The goal for acceptable measurement uncertainty for precision is defined as an upper 90 percent confidence limit for the CV of 10 percent and for bias as an upper 95 percent confidence limit for the absolute bias of 10 percent.
              2.4 National Performance Evaluation Program. Organizations operating PSD monitoring networks are required to implement the EPA's national performance evaluation program (NPEP) if the data will be used for NAAQS decisions and at the discretion of the PSD reviewing authority if PSD data are not used for NAAQS decisions. The NPEP includes the National Performance Audit Program (NPAP), the PM2.5 Performance Evaluation Program (PM2.5-PEP) and the Pb Performance Evaluation Program (Pb-PEP). The PSD QAPP shall provide for the implementation of NPEP including the provision of adequate resources for such NPEP if the data will be used for NAAQS decisions or if required by the PSD reviewing authority. Contact the PSD reviewing authority to determine the best procedure for implementing the audits which may include an audit by the PSD reviewing authority, a contractor certified for the activity, or through self-implementation which is described in sections below. A determination of which entity will be performing this audit program should be made as early as possible and during the QAPP development process. The PSD PQAOs, including contractors that plan to implement these programs on behalf of PSD PQAOs, that plan to implement these programs (self-implement) rather than use the federal programs, must meet the adequacy requirements found in the appropriate sections that follow, as well as meet the definition of independent assessment that follows.
              2.4.1 Independent Assessment. An assessment performed by a qualified individual, group, or organization that is not part of the organization directly performing and accountable for the work being assessed. This auditing organization must not be involved with the generation of the routinely-collected ambient air monitoring data. An organization can conduct the performance evaluation (PE) if it can meet this definition and has a management structure that, at a minimum, will allow for the separation of its routine sampling personnel from its auditing personnel by two levels of management. In addition, the sample analysis of audit filters must be performed by a laboratory facility and laboratory equipment separate from the facilities used for routine sample analysis. Field and laboratory personnel will be required to meet the performance evaluation field and laboratory training and certification requirements. The PSD PQAO will be required to participate in the centralized field and laboratory standards certification and comparison processes to establish comparability to federally implemented programs.
              2.5 Technical Systems Audit Program. The PSD reviewing authority or the EPA may conduct system audits of the ambient air monitoring programs or organizations operating PSD networks. The PSD monitoring organizations shall consult with the PSD reviewing authority to verify the schedule of any such technical systems audit. Systems audit programs are described in reference 10 of this appendix.
              2.6 Gaseous and Flow Rate Audit Standards.
              

              2.6.1 Gaseous pollutant concentration standards (permeation devices or cylinders of compressed gas) used to obtain test concentrations for carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) must be traceable to either a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Traceable Reference Material (NTRM) or a NIST-certified Gas Manufacturer's Internal Standard (GMIS), certified in accordance with one of the procedures given in reference 4 of this appendix. Vendors advertising certification with the procedures provided in reference 4 of this appendix and distributing gases as “EPA Protocol Gas” must participate in the EPA Protocol Gas Verification Program or not use “EPA” in any form of advertising. The PSD PQAOs must provide information to the PSD reviewing authority on the gas vendors they use (or will use) for the duration of the PSD monitoring project. This information can be provided in the QAPP or monitoring plan, but must be updated if there is a change in the producer used.
              2.6.2 Test concentrations for ozone (O3) must be obtained in accordance with the ultraviolet photometric calibration procedure specified in appendix D to Part 50, and by means of a certified NIST-traceable O3 transfer standard. Consult references 7 and 8 of this appendix for guidance on transfer standards for O3.
              2.6.3 Flow rate measurements must be made by a flow measuring instrument that is NIST-traceable to an authoritative volume or other applicable standard. Guidance for certifying some types of flow-meters is provided in reference 10 of this appendix.
              2.7 Primary Requirements and Guidance. Requirements and guidance documents for developing the quality system are contained in references 1 through 11 of this appendix, which also contain many suggested procedures, checks, and control specifications. Reference 10 describes specific guidance for the development of a quality system for data collected for comparison to the NAAQS. Many specific quality control checks and specifications for methods are included in the respective reference methods described in Part 50 or in the respective equivalent method descriptions available from the EPA (reference 6 of this appendix). Similarly, quality control procedures related to specifically designated reference and equivalent method monitors are contained in the respective operation or instruction manuals associated with those monitors. For PSD monitoring, the use of reference and equivalent method monitors are required.
              3. Measurement Quality Check Requirements

              This section provides the requirements for PSD PQAOs to perform the measurement quality checks that can be used to assess data quality. Data from these checks are required to be submitted to the PSD reviewing authority within the same time frame as routinely-collected ambient concentration data as described in 40 CFR 58.16. Table B-1 of this appendix provides a summary of the types and frequency of the measurement quality checks that are described in this section. Reporting these results to AQS may be required by the PSD reviewing authority.
              3.1 Gaseous monitors of SO
                2, NO
                2, O
                3, and CO.
              3.1.1 One-Point Quality Control (QC) Check for SO
                2,
                NO
                2, O
                3, and
                CO. (a) A one-point QC check must be performed at least once every 2 weeks on each automated monitor used to measure SO2, NO2, O3 and CO. With the advent of automated calibration systems, more frequent checking is strongly encouraged and may be required by the PSD reviewing authority. See Reference 10 of this appendix for guidance on the review procedure. The QC check is made by challenging the monitor with a QC check gas of known concentration (effective concentration for open path monitors) between the prescribed range of 0.005 and 0.08 parts per million (ppm) for SO2, NO2, and O3, and between the prescribed range of 0.5 and 5 ppm for CO monitors. The QC check gas concentration selected within the prescribed range should be related to monitoring objectives for the monitor. If monitoring for trace level monitoring, the QC check concentration should be selected to represent the mean or median concentrations at the site. If the mean or median concentrations at trace gas sites are below the MDL of the instrument the agency can select the lowest concentration in the prescribed range that can be practically achieved. If the mean or median concentrations at trace gas sites are above the prescribed range the agency can select the highest concentration in the prescribed range. The PSD monitoring organization will consult with the PSD reviewing authority on the most appropriate one-point QC concentration based on the objectives of the monitoring activity. An additional QC check point is encouraged for those organizations that may have occasional high values or would like to confirm the monitors' linearity at the higher end of the operational range or around NAAQS concentrations. If monitoring for NAAQS decisions the QC concentration can be selected at a higher concentration within the prescribed range but should also consider precision points around mean or median concentrations.
              (b) Point analyzers must operate in their normal sampling mode during the QC check and the test atmosphere must pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable. The QC check must be conducted before any calibration or adjustment to the monitor.
              (c) Open-path monitors are tested by inserting a test cell containing a QC check gas concentration into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the test and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be altered as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the test. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentration of the QC check gas in the test cell must be selected to produce an effective concentration in the range specified earlier in this section. Generally, the QC test concentration measurement will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the QC test concentration. As such, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the QC test from the QC check gas concentration measurement. If the difference between these before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas, discard the test result and repeat the test. If possible, open path monitors should be tested during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady.
              (d) Report the audit concentration of the QC gas and the corresponding measured concentration indicated by the monitor. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the precision and bias of the monitoring data as described in sections 4.1.2 (precision) and 4.1.3 (bias) of this appendix.
              3.1.2 Quarterly performance evaluation for SO
                2,
                NO
                2
                , O
                3
                , or CO. Evaluate each primary monitor each monitoring quarter (or 90 day frequency) during which monitors are operated or a least once (if operated for less than one quarter). The quarterly performance evaluation (quarterly PE) must be performed by a qualified individual, group, or organization that is not part of the organization directly performing and accountable for the work being assessed. The person or entity performing the quarterly PE must not be involved with the generation of the routinely-collected ambient air monitoring data. A PSD monitoring organization can conduct the quarterly PE itself if it can meet this definition and has a management structure that, at a minimum, will allow for the separation of its routine sampling personnel from its auditing personnel by two levels of management. The quarterly PE also requires a set of equipment and standards independent from those used for routine calibrations or zero, span or precision checks.

              3.1.2.1 The evaluation is made by challenging the monitor with audit gas standards of known concentration from at least three audit levels. One point must be within two to three times the method detection limit of the instruments within the PQAOs network, the second point will be less than or equal to the 99th percentile of the data at the site or the network of sites in the PQAO or the next highest audit concentration level. The third point can be around the primary NAAQS or the highest 3-year concentration at the site or the network of sites in the PQAO. An additional 4th level is encouraged for those PSD organizations that would like to confirm the monitor's linearity at the higher end of the operational range. In rare circumstances, there may be sites measuring concentrations above audit level 10. These sites should be identified to the PSD reviewing authority.

              3.1.2.2 The NO2 audit techniques may vary depending on the ambient monitoring method. For chemiluminescence-type NO2 analyzers, gas phase titration (GPT) techniques should be based on the EPA guidance documents and monitoring agency experience. The NO2 gas standards may be more appropriate than GPT for direct NO2 methods that do not employ converters. Care should be taken to ensure the stability of such gas standards prior to use.
              3.1.2.3 The standards from which audit gas test concentrations are obtained must meet the specifications of section 2.6.1 of this appendix.
              3.1.2.4 For point analyzers, the evaluation shall be carried out by allowing the monitor to analyze the audit gas test atmosphere in its normal sampling mode such that the test atmosphere passes through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other sample inlet components used during normal ambient sampling and as much of the ambient air inlet system as is practicable.
              3.1.2.5 Open-path monitors are evaluated by inserting a test cell containing the various audit gas concentrations into the optical measurement beam of the instrument. If possible, the normally used transmitter, receiver, and, as appropriate, reflecting devices should be used during the evaluation, and the normal monitoring configuration of the instrument should be modified as little as possible to accommodate the test cell for the evaluation. However, if permitted by the associated operation or instruction manual, an alternate local light source or an alternate optical path that does not include the normal atmospheric monitoring path may be used. The actual concentrations of the audit gas in the test cell must be selected to produce effective concentrations in the evaluation level ranges specified in this section of this appendix. Generally, each evaluation concentration measurement result will be the sum of the atmospheric pollutant concentration and the evaluation test concentration. As such, the result must be corrected to remove the atmospheric concentration contribution. The corrected concentration is obtained by subtracting the average of the atmospheric concentrations measured by the open-path instrument under test immediately before and immediately after the evaluation test (or preferably before and after each evaluation concentration level) from the evaluation concentration measurement. If the difference between the before and after measurements is greater than 20 percent of the effective concentration of the test gas standard, discard the test result for that concentration level and repeat the test for that level. If possible, open-path monitors should be evaluated during periods when the atmospheric pollutant concentrations are relatively low and steady. Also, if the open-path instrument is not installed in a permanent manner, the monitoring path length must be reverified to be within ±3 percent to validate the evaluation, since the monitoring path length is critical to the determination of the effective concentration.

              3.1.2.6 Report both the evaluation concentrations (effective concentrations for open-path monitors) of the audit gases and the corresponding measured concentration (corrected concentrations, if applicable, for open-path monitors) indicated or produced by the monitor being tested. The percent differences between these concentrations are used to assess the quality of the monitoring data as described in section 4.1.1 of this appendix.
              
              3.1.3 National Performance Audit Program (NPAP).As stated in sections 1.1 and 2.4, PSD monitoring networks may be subject to the NPEP, which includes the NPAP. The NPAP is a performance evaluation which is a type of audit where quantitative data are collected independently in order to evaluate the proficiency of an analyst, monitoring instrument and laboratory. Due to the implementation approach used in this program, NPAP provides for a national independent assessment of performance with a consistent level of data quality. The NPAP should not be confused with the quarterly PE program described in section 3.1.2. The PSD organizations shall consult with the PSD reviewing authority or the EPA regarding whether the implementation of NPAP is required and the implementation options available. Details of the EPA NPAP can be found in reference 11 of this appendix. The program requirements include:
              3.1.3.1 Performing audits on 100 percent of monitors and sites each year including monitors and sites that may be operated for less than 1 year. The PSD reviewing authority has the authority to require more frequent audits at sites they consider to be high priority.
              3.1.3.2 Developing a delivery system that will allow for the audit concentration gasses to be introduced at the probe inlet where logistically feasible.

              3.1.3.3 Using audit gases that are verified against the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference methods or special review procedures and validated annually for CO, SO2 and NO2, and at the beginning of each quarter of audits for O3.
              3.1.3.4 The PSD PQAO may elect to self-implement NPAP. In these cases, the PSD reviewing authority will work with those PSD PQAOs to establish training and other technical requirements to establish comparability to federally implemented programs. In addition to meeting the requirements in sections 3.1.1.3 through 3.1.3.3, the PSD PQAO must:
              (a) Ensure that the PSD audit system is equivalent to the EPA NPAP audit system and is an entirely separate set of equipment and standards from the equipment used for quarterly performance evaluations. If this system does not generate and analyze the audit concentrations, as the EPA NPAP system does, its equivalence to the EPA NPAP system must be proven to be as accurate under a full range of appropriate and varying conditions as described in section 3.1.3.6.
              (b) Perform a whole system check by having the PSD audit system tested at an independent and qualified EPA lab, or equivalent.
              (c) Evaluate the system with the EPA NPAP program through collocated auditing at an acceptable number of sites each year (at least one for a PSD network of five or less sites; at least two for a network with more than five sites).
              (d) Incorporate the NPAP into the PSD PQAO's QAPP.
              (e) Be subject to review by independent, EPA-trained personnel.
              (f) Participate in initial and update training/certification sessions.
              3.2 PM
                2.5.
              3.2.1 Flow Rate Verification for PM
                2.5. A one-point flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month (each verification minimally separated by 14 days) on each monitor used to measure PM2.5. The verification is made by checking the operational flow rate of the monitor. If the verification is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made prior to such flow rate adjustment. For the standard procedure, use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the monitor's normal flow rate. Care should be used in selecting and using the flow rate measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Flow rate verification results are to be reported to the PSD reviewing authority quarterly as described in section 5.1. Reporting these results to AQS is encouraged. The percent differences between the audit and measured flow rates are used to assess the bias of the monitoring data as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (using flow rates in lieu of concentrations).
              3.2.2 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for PM
                2.5. Every 6 months, audit the flow rate of the PM2.5 particulate monitors. For short-term monitoring operations (those less than 1 year), the flow rate audits must occur at start up, at the midpoint, and near the completion of the monitoring project. The audit must be conducted by a trained technician other than the routine site operator. The audit is made by measuring the monitor's normal operating flow rate using a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used for verifications or to calibrate the monitor. However, both the calibration standard and the audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume standard. Care must be taken in auditing the flow rate to be certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Report the audit flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured by the monitor. The percent differences between these flow rates are used to evaluate monitor performance.
              3.2.3 Collocated Sampling Procedures for PM
                2.5. A PSD PQAO must have at least one collocated monitor for each PSD monitoring network.
              3.2.3.1 For each pair of collocated monitors, designate one sampler as the primary monitor whose concentrations will be used to report air quality for the site, and designate the other as the QC monitor. There can be only one primary monitor at a monitoring site for a given time period.
              (a) If the primary monitor is a FRM, then the quality control monitor must be a FRM of the same method designation.
              (b) If the primary monitor is a FEM, then the quality control monitor must be a FRM unless the PSD PQAO submits a waiver for this requirement, provides a specific reason why a FRM cannot be implemented, and the waiver is approved by the PSD reviewing authority. If the waiver is approved, then the quality control monitor must be the same method designation as the primary FEM monitor.
              3.2.3.2 In addition, the collocated monitors should be deployed according to the following protocol:

              (a) The collocated quality control monitor(s) should be deployed at sites with the highest predicted daily PM2.5 concentrations in the network. If the highest PM2.5 concentration site is impractical for collocation purposes, alternative sites approved by the PSD reviewing authority may be selected. If additional collocated sites are necessary, the PSD PQAO and the PSD reviewing authority should determine the appropriate location(s) based on data needs.
              (b) The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. A waiver allowing up to 10 meters horizontal distance and up to 3 meters vertical distance (inlet to inlet) between a primary and collocated quality control monitor may be approved by the PSD reviewing authority for sites at a neighborhood or larger scale of representation. This waiver may be approved during the QAPP review and approval process. Sampling and analytical methodologies must be the consistently implemented for both collocated samplers and for all other samplers in the network.
              (c) Sample the collocated quality control monitor on a 6-day schedule for sites not requiring daily monitoring and on a 3-day schedule for any site requiring daily monitoring. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated quality control monitors at each collocated sampling site. The calculations for evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors are described in section 4.2.1 of this appendix.
              3.2.4 PM
                2.5
                Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) Procedures. As stated in sections 1.1 and 2.4 of this appendix, PSD monitoring networks may be subject to the NPEP, which includes the PM2.5 PEP. The PSD monitoring organizations shall consult with the PSD reviewing authority or the EPA regarding whether the implementation of PM2.5 PEP is required and the implementation options available for the PM2.5 PEP. For PSD PQAOs with less than or equal to five monitoring sites, five valid performance evaluation audits must be collected and reported each year. For PSD PQAOs with greater than five monitoring sites, eight valid performance evaluation audits must be collected and reported each year. Additionally, within the five or eight required audits, each type of method designation (FRM/FEM designation) used as a primary monitor in the PSD network shall be audited. For a PE to be valid, both the primary monitor and PEP audit measurements must meet quality control requirements and be above 3 µg/m3 or a predefined lower concentration level determined by a systematic planning process and approved by the PSD reviewing authority. Due to the relatively short-term nature of most PSD monitoring, the likelihood of measuring low concentrations in many areas attaining the PM2.5 standard and the time required to weigh filters collected in PEs, a PSD monitoring organization's QAPP may contain a provision to waive the 3 µg/m3 threshold for validity of PEs conducted in the last quarter of monitoring, subject to approval by the PSD reviewing authority.
              3.3 PM
                10.
              3.3.1 Flow Rate Verification for PM
                10. A one-point flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month (each verification minimally separated by 14 days) on each monitor used to measure PM10. The verification is made by checking the operational flow rate of the monitor. If the verification is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made prior to such flow rate adjustment. For the standard procedure, use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the monitor's normal flow rate. Care should be taken in selecting and using the flow rate measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. The percent differences between the audit and measured flow rates are used to assess the bias of the monitoring data as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (using flow rates in lieu of concentrations).
              3.3.2 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for PM
                10. Every 6 months, audit the flow rate of the PM10 particulate monitors. For short-term monitoring operations (those less than 1 year), the flow rate audits must occur at start up, at the midpoint, and near the completion of the monitoring project. Where possible, the EPA strongly encourages more frequent auditing. The audit must be conducted by a trained technician other than the routine site operator. The audit is made by measuring the monitor's normal operating flow rate using a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used for verifications or to calibrate the monitor. However, both the calibration standard and the audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume standard. Care must be taken in auditing the flow rate to be certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Report the audit flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured by the monitor. The percent differences between these flow rates are used to evaluate monitor performance
              3.3.3 Collocated Sampling Procedures for Manual PM
                10. A PSD PQAO must have at least one collocated monitor for each PSD monitoring network.
              3.3.3.1 For each pair of collocated monitors, designate one sampler as the primary monitor whose concentrations will be used to report air quality for the site, and designate the other as the quality control monitor.
              3.3.3.2 In addition, the collocated monitors should be deployed according to the following protocol:

              (a) The collocated quality control monitor(s) should be deployed at sites with the highest predicted daily PM10 concentrations in the network. If the highest PM10 concentration site is impractical for collocation purposes, alternative sites approved by the PSD reviewing authority may be selected.
              (b) The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. A waiver allowing up to 10 meters horizontal distance and up to 3 meters vertical distance (inlet to inlet) between a primary and collocated sampler may be approved by the PSD reviewing authority for sites at a neighborhood or larger scale of representation. This waiver may be approved during the QAPP review and approval process. Sampling and analytical methodologies must be the consistently implemented for both collocated samplers and for all other samplers in the network.
              (c) Sample the collocated quality control monitor on a 6-day schedule or 3-day schedule for any site requiring daily monitoring. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated quality control monitors at each collocated sampling site. The calculations for evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors are described in section 4.2.1 of this appendix.

              (d) In determining the number of collocated sites required for PM10, PSD monitoring networks for Pb-PM10 should be treated independently from networks for particulate matter (PM), even though the separate networks may share one or more common samplers. However, a single quality control monitor that meets the collocation requirements for Pb-PM10 and PM10 may serve as a collocated quality control monitor for both networks. Extreme care must be taken if using the filter from a quality control monitor for both PM10 and Pb analysis. PM10 filter weighing should occur prior to any Pb analysis.
              3.4 Pb.
              
              3.4.1 Flow Rate Verification for Pb. A one-point flow rate verification check must be performed at least once every month (each verification minimally separated by 14 days) on each monitor used to measure Pb. The verification is made by checking the operational flow rate of the monitor. If the verification is made in conjunction with a flow rate adjustment, it must be made prior to such flow rate adjustment. Use a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix to check the monitor's normal flow rate. Care should be taken in selecting and using the flow rate measurement device such that it does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. The percent differences between the audit and measured flow rates are used to assess the bias of the monitoring data as described in section 4.2.2 of this appendix (using flow rates in lieu of concentrations).
              3.4.2 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit for Pb. Every 6 months, audit the flow rate of the Pb particulate monitors. For short-term monitoring operations (those less than 1 year), the flow rate audits must occur at start up, at the midpoint, and near the completion of the monitoring project. Where possible, the EPA strongly encourages more frequent auditing. The audit must be conducted by a trained technician other than the routine site operator. The audit is made by measuring the monitor's normal operating flow rate using a flow rate transfer standard certified in accordance with section 2.6 of this appendix. The flow rate standard used for auditing must not be the same flow rate standard used to in verifications or to calibrate the monitor. However, both the calibration standard and the audit standard may be referenced to the same primary flow rate or volume standard. Great care must be taken in auditing the flow rate to be certain that the flow measurement device does not alter the normal operating flow rate of the monitor. Report the audit flow rate of the transfer standard and the corresponding flow rate measured by the monitor. The percent differences between these flow rates are used to evaluate monitor performance.
              
              3.4.3 Collocated Sampling for Pb. A PSD PQAO must have at least one collocated monitor for each PSD monitoring network.
              3.4.3.1 For each pair of collocated monitors, designate one sampler as the primary monitor whose concentrations will be used to report air quality for the site, and designate the other as the quality control monitor.
              3.4.3.2 In addition, the collocated monitors should be deployed according to the following protocol:
              (a) The collocated quality control monitor(s) should be deployed at sites with the highest predicted daily Pb concentrations in the network. If the highest Pb concentration site is impractical for collocation purposes, alternative sites approved by the PSD reviewing authority may be selected.
              (b) The two collocated monitors must be within 4 meters of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference. A waiver allowing up to 10 meters horizontal distance and up to 3 meters vertical distance (inlet to inlet) between a primary and collocated sampler may be approved by the PSD reviewing authority for sites at a neighborhood or larger scale of representation. This waiver may be approved during the QAPP review and approval process. Sampling and analytical methodologies must be the consistently implemented for both collocated samplers and all other samplers in the network.
              (c) Sample the collocated quality control monitor on a 6-day schedule if daily monitoring is not required or 3-day schedule for any site requiring daily monitoring. Report the measurements from both primary and collocated quality control monitors at each collocated sampling site. The calculations for evaluating precision between the two collocated monitors are described in section 4.2.1 of this appendix.

              (d) In determining the number of collocated sites required for Pb-PM10, PSD monitoring networks for PM10 should be treated independently from networks for Pb-PM10, even though the separate networks may share one or more common samplers. However, a single quality control monitor that meets the collocation requirements for Pb-PM10 and PM10 may serve as a collocated quality control monitor for both networks. Extreme care must be taken if using a using the filter from a quality control monitor for both PM10 and Pb analysis. The PM10 filter weighing should occur prior to any Pb analysis.
              3.4.4 Pb Analysis Audits. Each calendar quarter, audit the Pb reference or equivalent method analytical procedure using filters containing a known quantity of Pb. These audit filters are prepared by depositing a Pb standard on unexposed filters and allowing them to dry thoroughly. The audit samples must be prepared using batches of reagents different from those used to calibrate the Pb analytical equipment being audited. Prepare audit samples in the following concentration ranges:
              
                
                  Range
                  Equivalent ambientPb concentration, µg/m3
                    
                  
                
                
                  1
                  30-100% of Pb NAAQS.
                
                
                  2
                  200-300% of Pb NAAQS.
                
              
              (a) Audit samples must be extracted using the same extraction procedure used for exposed filters.
              (b) Analyze three audit samples in each of the two ranges each quarter samples are analyzed. The audit sample analyses shall be distributed as much as possible over the entire calendar quarter.
              (c) Report the audit concentrations (in µg Pb/filter or strip) and the corresponding measured concentrations (in µg Pb/filter or strip) using AQS unit code 077 (if reporting to AQS). The percent differences between the concentrations are used to calculate analytical accuracy as described in section 4.2.5 of this appendix.
              3.4.5 Pb Performance Evaluation Program (PEP) Procedures. As stated in sections 1.1 and 2.4, PSD monitoring networks may be subject to the NPEP, which includes the Pb PEP. The PSD monitoring organizations shall consult with the PSD reviewing authority or the EPA regarding whether the implementation of Pb-PEP is required and the implementation options available for the Pb-PEP. The PEP is an independent assessment used to estimate total measurement system bias. Each year, one PE audit must be performed at one Pb site in each PSD PQAO network that has less than or equal to five sites and two audits for PSD PQAO networks with greater than five sites. In addition, each year, four collocated samples from PSD PQAO networks with less than or equal to five sites and six collocated samples from PSD PQAO networks with greater than five sites must be sent to an independent laboratory for analysis. The calculations for evaluating bias between the primary monitor and the PE monitor for Pb are described in section 4.2.4 of this appendix.
              4. Calculations for Data Quality Assessments

              (a) Calculations of measurement uncertainty are carried out by PSD PQAO according to the following procedures. The PSD PQAOs should report the data for all appropriate measurement quality checks as specified in this appendix even though they may elect to perform some or all of the calculations in this section on their own.
              
              (b) At low concentrations, agreement between the measurements of collocated samplers, expressed as relative percent difference or percent difference, may be relatively poor. For this reason, collocated measurement pairs will be selected for use in the precision and bias calculations only when both measurements are equal to or above the following limits:
              (1) Pb: 0.002 µg/m3 (Methods approved after 3/04/2010, with exception of manual equivalent method EQLA-0813-803).
              (2) Pb: 0.02 µg/m3 (Methods approved before 3/04/2010, and manual equivalent method EQLA-0813-803).
              (3) PM10 (Hi-Vol): 15 µg/m3.
              (4) PM10 (Lo-Vol): 3 µg/m3.
              (5) PM2.5: 3 µg/m3.
              (c) The PM2.5 3 µg/m3 limit for the PM2.5−PEP may be superseded by mutual agreement between the PSD PQAO and the PSD reviewing authority as specified in section 3.2.4 of the appendix and detailed in the approved QAPP.

                2
                , O3
                 and CO.
              4.1.1 Percent Difference. Many of the measurement quality checks start with a comparison of an audit concentration or value (flow-rate) to the concentration/value measured by the monitor and use percent difference as the comparison statistic as described in equation 1 of this section. For each single point check, calculate the percent difference, d
                i, as follows:
              
                ER28MR16.008
              
              where meas is the concentration indicated by the PQAO's instrument and audit is the audit concentration of the standard used in the QC check being measured.
              4.1.2 Precision Estimate. The precision estimate is used to assess the one-point QC checks for SO2, NO2, O3, or CO described in section 3.1.1 of this appendix. The precision estimator is the coefficient of variation upper bound and is calculated using equation 2 of this section:
              
                ER28MR16.009
              
              where n is the number of single point checks being aggregated; X2
                0.1,n-1 is the 10th percentile of a chi-squared distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.
              4.1.3 Bias Estimate. The bias estimate is calculated using the one-point QC checks for SO2, NO2, O3, or CO described in section 3.1.1 of this appendix. The bias estimator is an upper bound on the mean absolute value of the percent differences as described in equation 3 of this section:
              
                
                ER28MR16.010
              
              where n is the number of single point checks being aggregated; t0.95,n-1 is the 95th quantile of a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom; the quantity AB is the mean of the absolute values of the d
                i′s and is calculated using equation 4 of this section:
              
                ER28MR16.011
              
              and the quantity AS is the standard deviation of the absolute value of the d
                i′s and is calculated using equation 5 of this section:
              
                ER28MR16.012
              
              4.1.3.1 Assigning a sign (positive/negative) to the bias estimate. Since the bias statistic as calculated in equation 3 of this appendix uses absolute values, it does not have a tendency (negative or positive bias) associated with it. A sign will be designated by rank ordering the percent differences of the QC check samples from a given site for a particular assessment interval.
              4.1.3.2 Calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles of the percent differences for each site. The absolute bias upper bound should be flagged as positive if both percentiles are positive and negative if both percentiles are negative. The absolute bias upper bound would not be flagged if the 25th and 75th percentiles are of different signs.

              4.2.1 Collocated Quality Control Sampler Precision Estimate for PM

                , PM
                2.5
                and Pb. Precision is estimated via duplicate measurements from collocated samplers. It is recommended that the precision be aggregated at the PQAO level quarterly, annually, and at the 3-year level. The data pair would only be considered valid if both concentrations are greater than or equal to the minimum values specified in section 4(c) of this appendix. For each collocated data pair, calculate the relative percent difference, d
                i, using equation 6 of this appendix:
              
                
                ER28MR16.013
              
              where X
                i is the concentration from the primary sampler and Y
                i is the concentration value from the audit sampler. The coefficient of variation upper bound is calculated using equation 7 of this appendix:
              
                ER28MR16.014
              
              where n is the number of valid data pairs being aggregated, and X2
                0.1,n-1 is the 10th percentile of a chi-squared distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. The factor of 2 in the denominator adjusts for the fact that each d
                i is calculated from two values with error.

                2.5
                and Pb. For each one-point flow rate verification, calculate the percent difference in volume using equation 1 of this appendix where meas is the value indicated by the sampler's volume measurement and audit is the actual volume indicated by the auditing flow meter. The absolute volume bias upper bound is then calculated using equation 3, where n is the number of flow rate audits being aggregated; t0.95,n-1 is the 95th quantile of a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, the quantity AB is the mean of the absolute values of the d
                i′s and is calculated using equation 4 of this appendix, and the quantity AS in equation 3 of this appendix is the standard deviation of the absolute values if the d
                i′s and is calculated using equation 5 of this appendix.
              4.2.3 Semi-Annual Flow Rate Audit Bias Estimate for PM

                , PM
                2.5

              4.2.4 Performance Evaluation Programs Bias Estimate for Pb. The Pb bias estimate is calculated using the paired routine and the PEP monitor as described in section 3.4.5. Use the same procedures as described in section 4.1.3 of this appendix.
              4.2.5 Performance Evaluation Programs Bias Estimate for PM
                2.5. The bias estimate is calculated using the PEP audits described in section 4.1.3 of this appendix. The bias estimator is based on the mean percent differences (Equation 1). The mean percent difference, D, is calculated by Equation 8 below.
              
                ER28MR16.015
              
              where nj is the number of pairs and d1,d2,...dnj are the biases for each pair to be averaged.
              4.2.6 Pb Analysis Audit Bias Estimate. The bias estimate is calculated using the analysis audit data described in section 3.4.4. Use the same bias estimate procedure as described in section 4.1.3 of this appendix.
              
              5. Reporting Requirements
              5.1. Quarterly Reports. For each quarter, each PSD PQAO shall report to the PSD reviewing authority (and AQS if required by the PSD reviewing authority) the results of all valid measurement quality checks it has carried out during the quarter. The quarterly reports must be submitted consistent with the data reporting requirements specified for air quality data as set forth in 40 CFR 58.16 and pertain to PSD monitoring.

              Appendix C to Part 58—Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Methodology
              1.0 Purpose
              2.0 SLAMS Ambient Air Monitoring Stations
              3.0 NCore Ambient Air Monitoring Stations
              4.0 Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS)
              5.0 Particulate Matter Episode Monitoring
              6.0 References
              1.0 Purpose
              This appendix specifies the criteria pollutant monitoring methods (manual methods or automated analyzers) which must be used in SLAMS and NCore stations that are a subset of SLAMS.
              2.0 SLAMS Ambient Air Monitoring Network
              2.1 Except as otherwise provided in this appendix, a criteria pollutant monitoring method used for making NAAQS decisions at a SLAMS site must be a reference or equivalent method as defined in § 50.1 of this chapter.
              2.1.1 Any NO2 FRM or FEM used for making primary NAAQS decisions must be capable of providing hourly averaged concentration data.
              
              2.2 Reserved
              2.3 Any manual method or analyzer purchased prior to cancellation of its reference or equivalent method designation under § 53.11 or § 53.16 of this chapter may be used at a SLAMS site following cancellation for a reasonable period of time to be determined by the Administrator.
              2.4 Approval of Non-designated Continuous PM 2.5 Methods as Approved Regional Methods (ARMs) Operated Within a Network of Sites. A method for PM 2.5 that has not been designated as an FRM or FEM as defined in § 50.1 of this chapter may be approved as an ARM for purposes of section 2.1 of this appendix at a particular site or network of sites under the following stipulations.

              2.4.1 The candidate ARM must be demonstrated to meet the requirements for PM 2.5 Class III equivalent methods as defined in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. Specifically the requirements for precision, correlation, and additive and multiplicative bias apply. For purposes of this section 2.4, the following requirements shall apply:
              2.4.1.1 The candidate ARM shall be tested at the site(s) in which it is intended to be used. For a network of sites operated by one reporting agency or primary quality assurance organization, the testing shall occur at a subset of sites to include one site in each MSA/CSA, up to the first 2 highest population MSA/CSA and at least one rural area or Micropolitan Statistical Area site. If the candidate ARM for a network is already approved for purposes of this section in another agency's network, subsequent testing shall minimally occur at one site in a MSA/CSA and one rural area or Micropolitan Statistical Area. There shall be no requirement for tests at any other sites.
              2.4.1.2 For purposes of this section, a full year of testing may begin and end in any season, so long as all seasons are covered.
              2.4.1.3 No PM 10 samplers shall be required for the test, as determination of the PM 2.5/PM 10 ratio at the test site shall not be required.
              2.4.1.4 The test specification for PM 2.5 Class III equivalent method precision defined in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter applies; however, there is no specific requirement that collocated continuous monitors be operated for purposes of generating a statistic for coefficient of variation (CV). To provide an estimate of precision that meets the requirement identified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter, agencies may cite peer-reviewed published data or data in AQS that can be presented demonstrating the candidate ARM operated will produce data that meets the specification for precision of Class III PM 2.5 methods.
              2.4.1.5 A minimum of 90 valid sample pairs per site for the year with no less than 20 valid sample pairs per season must be generated for use in demonstrating that additive bias, multiplicative bias and correlation meet the comparability requirements specified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. A valid sample pair may be generated with as little as one valid FRM and one valid candidate ARM measurement per day.
              2.4.1.6 For purposes of determining bias, FRM data with concentrations less than 3 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) may be excluded. Exclusion of data does not result in failure of sample completeness specified in this section.
              2.4.1.7 Data transformations are allowed to be used to demonstrate meeting the comparability requirements specified in subpart C of part 53 of this chapter. Data transformation may be linear or non-linear, but must be applied in the same way to all sites used in the testing.
              2.4.2 The monitoring agency wishing to use an ARM must develop and implement appropriate quality assurance procedures for the method. Additionally, the following procedures are required for the method:
              2.4.2.1 The ARM must be consistently operated throughout the network. Exceptions to a consistent operation must be approved according to section 2.8 of this appendix;
              2.4.2.2 The ARM must be operated on an hourly sampling frequency capable of providing data suitable for aggregation into daily 24-hour average measurements;

              2.4.2.3 The ARM must use an inlet and separation device, as needed, that are already approved in either the reference method identified in appendix L to part 50 of this chapter or under part 53 of this chapter as approved for use on a PM 2.5 reference or equivalent method. The only exceptions to this requirement are those methods that by their inherent measurement principle may not need an inlet or separation device that segregates the aerosol; and
              2.4.2.4 The ARM must be capable of providing for flow audits, unless by its inherent measurement principle, measured flow is not required. These flow audits are to be performed on the frequency identified in appendix A to this part.

              2.4.2.5 If data transformations are used, they must be described in the monitoring agencies Quality Assurance Project plan (or addendum to QAPP). The QAPP shall describe how often (e.g., quarterly, yearly) and under what provisions the data transformation will be updated. For example, not meeting the data quality objectives for a site over a season or year may be cause for recalculating a data transformation, but by itself would not be cause for invalidating the data. Data transformations must be applied prospectively, i.e., in real-time or near real-time, to the data output from the PM 2.5 continuous method. See reference 7 of this appendix.
              
              2.4.3 The monitoring agency wishing to use the method must develop and implement appropriate procedures for assessing and reporting the precision and accuracy of the method comparable to the procedures set forth in appendix A of this part for designated reference and equivalent methods.
              2.4.4 Assessments of data quality shall follow the same frequencies and calculations as required under section 3 of appendix A to this part with the following exceptions:
              2.4.4.1 Collocation of ARM with FRM/FEM samplers must be maintained at a minimum of 30 percent of the required SLAMS sites with a minimum of 1 per network;
              2.4.4.2 All collocated FRM/FEM samplers must maintain a sample frequency of at least 1 in 6 sample days;
              2.4.4.3 Collocated FRM/FEM samplers shall be located at the design value site, with the required FRM/FEM samplers deployed among the largest MSA/CSA in the network, until all required FRM/FEM are deployed; and
              2.4.4.4 Data from collocated FRM/FEM are to be substituted for any calendar quarter that an ARM method has incomplete data.
              2.4.4.5 Collocation with an ARM under this part for purposes of determining the coefficient of variation of the method shall be conducted at a minimum of 7.5 percent of the sites with a minimum of 1 per network. This is consistent with the requirements in appendix A to this part for one-half of the required collocation of FRM/FEM (15 percent) to be collocated with the same method.
              2.4.4.6 Assessments of bias with an independent audit of the total measurement system shall be conducted with the same frequency as an FEM as identified in appendix A to this part.
              2.4.5 Request for approval of a candidate ARM, that is not already approved in another agency's network under this section, must meet the general submittal requirements of section 2.7 of this appendix. Requests for approval under this section when an ARM is already approved in another agency's network are to be submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator. Requests for approval under section 2.4 of this appendix must include the following requirements:
              2.4.5.1 A clear and unique description of the site(s) at which the candidate ARM will be used and tested, and a description of the nature or character of the site and the particulate matter that is expected to occur there.
              2.4.5.2 A detailed description of the method and the nature of the sampler or analyzer upon which it is based.
              2.4.5.3 A brief statement of the reason or rationale for requesting the approval.
              2.4.5.4 A detailed description of the quality assurance procedures that have been developed and that will be implemented for the method.
              2.4.5.5 A detailed description of the procedures for assessing the precision and accuracy of the method that will be implemented for reporting to AQS.
              2.4.5.6 Test results from the comparability tests as required in section 2.4.1 through 2.4.1.4 of this appendix.
              2.4.5.7 Such further supplemental information as may be necessary or helpful to support the required statements and test results.
              2.4.6 Within 120 days after receiving a request for approval of the use of an ARM at a particular site or network of sites under section 2.4 of this appendix, the Administrator will approve or disapprove the method by letter to the person or agency requesting such approval. When appropriate for methods that are already approved in another SLAMS network, the EPA Regional Administrator has approval/disapproval authority. In either instance, additional information may be requested to assist with the decision.
              2.5 [Reserved]
              2.6 Use of Methods With Higher, Nonconforming Ranges in Certain Geographical Areas.
              2.6.1 [Reserved]
              2.6.2 An analyzer may be used (indefinitely) on a range which extends to concentrations higher than two times the upper limit specified in table B-1 of part 53 of this chapter if:
              2.6.2.1 The analyzer has more than one selectable range and has been designated as a reference or equivalent method on at least one of its ranges, or has been approved for use under section 2.5 (which applies to analyzers purchased before February 18, 1975);
              2.6.2.2 The pollutant intended to be measured with the analyzer is likely to occur in concentrations more than two times the upper range limit specified in table B-1 of part 53 of this chapter in the geographical area in which use of the analyzer is proposed; and
              2.6.2.3 The Administrator determines that the resolution of the range or ranges for which approval is sought is adequate for its intended use. For purposes of this section (2.6), “resolution” means the ability of the analyzer to detect small changes in concentration.
              2.6.3 Requests for approval under section 2.6.2 of this appendix must meet the submittal requirements of section 2.7. Except as provided in section 2.7.3 of this appendix, each request must contain the information specified in section 2.7.2 in addition to the following:
              2.6.3.1 The range or ranges proposed to be used;

              2.6.3.2 Test data, records, calculations, and test results as specified in section 2.7.2.2 of this appendix for each range proposed to be used;
              
              2.6.3.3 An identification and description of the geographical area in which use of the analyzer is proposed;
              2.6.3.4 Data or other information demonstrating that the pollutant intended to be measured with the analyzer is likely to occur in concentrations more than two times the upper range limit specified in table B-1 of part 53 of this chapter in the geographical area in which use of the analyzer is proposed; and
              2.6.3.5 Test data or other information demonstrating the resolution of each proposed range that is broader than that permitted by section 2.5 of this appendix.
              2.6.4 Any person who has obtained approval of a request under this section (2.6.2) shall assure that the analyzer for which approval was obtained is used only in the geographical area identified in the request and only while operated in the range or ranges specified in the request.
              2.7 Requests for Approval; Withdrawal of Approval.
              2.7.1 Requests for approval under sections 2.4, 2.6.2, or 2.8 of this appendix must be submitted to: Director, National Exposure Research Laboratory (MD-D205-03), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711. For ARM that are already approved in another agency's network, subsequent requests for approval under section 2.4 are to be submitted to the applicable EPA Regional Administrator.
              2.7.2 Except as provided in section 2.7.3 of this appendix, each request must contain:
              2.7.2.1 A statement identifying the analyzer (e.g., by serial number) and the method of which the analyzer is representative (e.g., by manufacturer and model number); and
              2.7.2.2 Test data, records, calculations, and test results for the analyzer (or the method of which the analyzer is representative) as specified in subpart B, subpart C, or both (as applicable) of part 53 of this chapter.
              2.7.3 A request may concern more than one analyzer or geographical area and may incorporate by reference any data or other information known to EPA from one or more of the following:
              2.7.3.1 An application for a reference or equivalent method determination submitted to EPA for the method of which the analyzer is representative, or testing conducted by the applicant or by EPA in connection with such an application;
              2.7.3.2 Testing of the method of which the analyzer is representative at the initiative of the Administrator under § 53.7 of this chapter; or
              2.7.3.3 A previous or concurrent request for approval submitted to EPA under this section (2.7).
              2.7.4 To the extent that such incorporation by reference provides data or information required by this section (2.7) or by sections 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6 of this appendix, independent data or duplicative information need not be submitted.
              2.7.5 After receiving a request under this section (2.7), the Administrator may request such additional testing or information or conduct such tests as may be necessary in his judgment for a decision on the request.
              2.7.6 If the Administrator determines, on the basis of any available information, that any of the determinations or statements on which approval of a request under this section was based are invalid or no longer valid, or that the requirements of section 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6, as applicable, have not been met, he/she may withdraw the approval after affording the person who obtained the approval an opportunity to submit information and arguments opposing such action.
              2.8 Modifications of Methods by Users.
              2.8.1 Except as otherwise provided in this section, no reference method, equivalent method, or ARM may be used in a SLAMS network if it has been modified in a manner that could significantly alter the performance characteristics of the method without prior approval by the Administrator. For purposes of this section, “alternative method” means an analyzer, the use of which has been approved under section 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6 of this appendix or some combination thereof.
              2.8.2 Requests for approval under this section (2.8) must meet the submittal requirements of sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.2.1 of this appendix.
              2.8.3 Each request submitted under this section (2.8) must include:
              2.8.3.1 A description, in such detail as may be appropriate, of the desired modification;
              2.8.3.2 A brief statement of the purpose(s) of the modification, including any reasons for considering it necessary or advantageous;
              2.8.3.3 A brief statement of belief concerning the extent to which the modification will or may affect the performance characteristics of the method; and
              2.8.3.4 Such further information as may be necessary to explain and support the statements required by sections 2.8.3.2 and 2.8.3.3.
              2.8.4 The Administrator will approve or disapprove the modification by letter to the person or agency requesting such approval within 75 days after receiving a request for approval under this section and any further information that the applicant may be asked to provide.

              2.8.5 A temporary modification that could alter the performance characteristics of a reference, equivalent, or ARM may be made without prior approval under this section if the method is not functioning or is malfunctioning, provided that parts necessary for repair in accordance with the applicable operation manual cannot be obtained within 45 days. Unless such temporary modification is later approved under section 2.8.4 of this appendix, the temporarily modified method shall be repaired in accordance with the applicable operation manual as quickly as practicable but in no event later than 4 months after the temporary modification was made, unless an extension of time is granted by the Administrator. Unless and until the temporary modification is approved, air quality data obtained with the method as temporarily modified must be clearly identified as such when submitted in accordance with § 58.16 and must be accompanied by a report containing the information specified in section 2.8.3 of this appendix. A request that the Administrator approve a temporary modification may be submitted in accordance with sections 2.8.1 through 2.8.4 of this appendix. In such cases the request will be considered as if a request for prior approval had been made.
              2.9 Use of IMPROVE Samplers at a SLAMS Site. “IMPROVE” samplers may be used in SLAMS for monitoring of regional background and regional transport concentrations of fine particulate matter. The IMPROVE samplers were developed for use in the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network to characterize all of the major components and many trace constituents of the particulate matter that impair visibility in Federal Class I Areas. Descriptions of the IMPROVE samplers and the data they collect are available in references 4, 5, and 6 of this appendix.
              2.10 Use of Pb-PM
                10
                at SLAMS Sites.
              

              2.10.1 The EPA Regional Administrator may approve the use of a Pb-PM 10 FRM or Pb-PM 10 FEM sampler in lieu of a Pb-TSP sampler as part of the network plan required under part 58.10(a)(4) in the following cases.
              2.10.1.1 Pb-PM 10 samplers can be approved for use at the non-source-oriented sites required under paragraph 4.5(b) of Appendix D to part 58 if there is no existing monitoring data indicating that the maximum arithmetic 3-month mean Pb concentration (either Pb-TSP or Pb-PM 10) at the site was equal to or greater than 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter during the previous 3 years.
              2.10.1.2 Pb-PM 10 samplers can be approved for use at source-oriented sites required under paragraph 4.5(a) if the monitoring agency can demonstrate (through modeling or historic monitoring data from the last 3 years) that Pb concentrations (either Pb-TSP or Pb-PM 10) will not equal or exceed 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter on an arithmetic 3-month mean and the source is expected to emit a substantial majority of its Pb in the fraction of PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 10 micrometers.
              2.10.2 The approval of a Pb-PM 10 sampler in lieu of a Pb-TSP sampler as allowed for in paragraph 2.10.1 above will be revoked if measured Pb-PM 10 concentrations equal or exceed 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter on an arithmetic 3-month mean. Monitoring agencies will have up to 6 months from the end of the 3-month period in which the arithmetic 3-month Pb-PM 10 mean concentration equaled or exceeded 0.10 micrograms per cubic meter to install and begin operation of a Pb-TSP sampler at the site.
              3.0 NCore Ambient Air Monitoring Stations

              3.1 Methods employed in NCore multipollutant sites used to measure SO2, CO, NO2, O3, PM 2.5, or PM 10-2.5 must be reference or equivalent methods as defined in § 50.1 of this chapter, or an ARM as defined in section 2.4 of this appendix, for any monitors intended for comparison with applicable NAAQS.
              3.2 If alternative SO2, CO, NO2, O3, PM 2.5, or PM 10-2.5 monitoring methodologies are proposed for monitors not intended for NAAQS comparison, such techniques must be detailed in the network description required by § 58.10 and subsequently approved by the Administrator. Examples of locations that are not intended to be compared to the NAAQS may be rural background and transport sites or areas where the concentration of the pollutant is so low that it would be more useful to operate a higher sensitivity method that is not an FRM or FEM.
              4.0 Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS)
              4.1 Methods used for O3 monitoring at PAMS must be automated reference or equivalent methods as defined in § 50.1 of this chapter.
              4.2 Methods used for NO, NO2 and NOX monitoring at PAMS should be automated reference or equivalent methods as defined for NO2 in § 50.1 of this chapter. If alternative NO, NO2 or NOX monitoring methodologies are proposed, such techniques must be detailed in the network description required by § 58.10 and subsequently approved by the Administrator.
              4.3 Methods for meteorological measurements and speciated VOC monitoring are included in the guidance provided in references 2 and 3 of this appendix. If alternative VOC monitoring methodology (including the use of new or innovative technologies), which is not included in the guidance, is proposed, it must be detailed in the network description required by § 58.10 and subsequently approved by the Administrator.
              5.0 Particulate Matter Episode Monitoring
              5.1 For short-term measurements of PM 10 during air pollution episodes (see § 51.152 of this chapter) the measurement method must be:
              
              5.1.1 Either the “Staggered PM 10” method or the “PM 10 Sampling Over Short Sampling Times” method, both of which are based on the reference method for PM 10 and are described in reference 1: or
              5.1.2 Any other method for measuring PM 10:

              5.1.2.1 Which has a measurement range or ranges appropriate to accurately measure air pollution episode concentration of PM 10,

              5.1.2.2 Which has a sample period appropriate for short-term PM 10 measurements, and

              5.1.2.3 For which a quantitative relationship to a reference or equivalent method for PM 10 has been established at the use site. Procedures for establishing a quantitative site-specific relationship are contained in reference 1.
              5.2 PM 10 methods other than the reference method are not covered under the quality assessment requirements of appendix to this part. Therefore, States must develop and implement their own quality assessment procedures for those methods allowed under this section 4. These quality assessment procedures should be similar or analogous to those described in section 3 of appendix A to this part for the PM 10 reference method.

              1. Monitoring Objectives and Spatial Scales

              The purpose of this appendix is to describe monitoring objectives and general criteria to be applied in establishing the required SLAMS ambient air quality monitoring stations and for choosing general locations for additional monitoring sites. This appendix also describes specific requirements for the number and location of FRM, FEM, and ARM sites for specific pollutants, NCore multipollutant sites, PM 10 mass sites, PM 2.5 mass sites, chemically-speciated PM 2.5 sites, and O3 precursor measurements sites (PAMS). These criteria will be used by EPA in evaluating the adequacy of the air pollutant monitoring networks.
              1.1 Monitoring Objectives. The ambient air monitoring networks must be designed to meet three basic monitoring objectives. These basic objectives are listed below. The appearance of any one objective in the order of this list is not based upon a prioritized scheme. Each objective is important and must be considered individually.
              (a) Provide air pollution data to the general public in a timely manner. Data can be presented to the public in a number of attractive ways including through air quality maps, newspapers, Internet sites, and as part of weather forecasts and public advisories.

              (b) Support compliance with ambient air quality standards and emissions strategy development. Data from FRM, FEM, and ARM monitors for NAAQS pollutants will be used for comparing an area's air pollution levels against the NAAQS. Data from monitors of various types can be used in the development of attainment and maintenance plans. SLAMS, and especially NCore station data, will be used to evaluate the regional air quality models used in developing emission strategies, and to track trends in air pollution abatement control measures' impact on improving air quality. In monitoring locations near major air pollution sources, source-oriented monitoring data can provide insight into how well industrial sources are controlling their pollutant emissions.
              (c) Support for air pollution research studies. Air pollution data from the NCore network can be used to supplement data collected by researchers working on health effects assessments and atmospheric processes, or for monitoring methods development work.
              1.1.1 In order to support the air quality management work indicated in the three basic air monitoring objectives, a network must be designed with a variety of types of monitoring sites. Monitoring sites must be capable of informing managers about many things including the peak air pollution levels, typical levels in populated areas, air pollution transported into and outside of a city or region, and air pollution levels near specific sources. To summarize some of these sites, here is a listing of six general site types:
              (a) Sites located to determine the highest concentrations expected to occur in the area covered by the network.
              (b) Sites located to measure typical concentrations in areas of high population density.
              (c) Sites located to determine the impact of significant sources or source categories on air quality.
              (d) Sites located to determine general background concentration levels.
              (e) Sites located to determine the extent of regional pollutant transport among populated areas; and in support of secondary standards.
              (f) Sites located to measure air pollution impacts on visibility, vegetation damage, or other welfare-based impacts.
              1.1.2 This appendix contains criteria for the basic air monitoring requirements. The total number of monitoring sites that will serve the variety of data needs will be substantially higher than these minimum requirements provide. The optimum size of a particular network involves trade-offs among data needs and available resources. This regulation intends to provide for national air monitoring needs, and to lend support for the flexibility necessary to meet data collection needs of area air quality managers. The EPA, State, and local agencies will periodically collaborate on network design issues through the network assessment process outlined in § 58.10.
              1.1.3 This appendix focuses on the relationship between monitoring objectives, site types, and the geographic location of monitoring sites. Included are a rationale and set of general criteria for identifying candidate site locations in terms of physical characteristics which most closely match a specific monitoring objective. The criteria for more specifically locating the monitoring site, including spacing from roadways and vertical and horizontal probe and path placement, are described in appendix E to this part.
              1.2 Spatial Scales. (a) To clarify the nature of the link between general monitoring objectives, site types, and the physical location of a particular monitor, the concept of spatial scale of representativeness is defined. The goal in locating monitors is to correctly match the spatial scale represented by the sample of monitored air with the spatial scale most appropriate for the monitoring site type, air pollutant to be measured, and the monitoring objective.
              (b) Thus, spatial scale of representativeness is described in terms of the physical dimensions of the air parcel nearest to a monitoring site throughout which actual pollutant concentrations are reasonably similar. The scales of representativeness of most interest for the monitoring site types described above are as follows:
              (1) Microscale—Defines the concentrations in air volumes associated with area dimensions ranging from several meters up to about 100 meters.
              (2) Middle scale—Defines the concentration typical of areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions ranging from about 100 meters to 0.5 kilometer.
              (3) Neighborhood scale—Defines concentrations within some extended area of the city that has relatively uniform land use with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometers range. The neighborhood and urban scales listed below have the potential to overlap in applications that concern secondarily formed or homogeneously distributed air pollutants.
              (4) Urban scale—Defines concentrations within an area of city-like dimensions, on the order of 4 to 50 kilometers. Within a city, the geographic placement of sources may result in there being no single site that can be said to represent air quality on an urban scale.
              (5) Regional scale—Defines usually a rural area of reasonably homogeneous geography without large sources, and extends from tens to hundreds of kilometers.
              (6) National and global scales—These measurement scales represent concentrations characterizing the nation and the globe as a whole.

              (c) Proper siting of a monitor requires specification of the monitoring objective, the types of sites necessary to meet the objective, and then the desired spatial scale of representativeness. For example, consider the case where the objective is to determine NAAQS compliance by understanding the maximum ozone concentrations for an area. Such areas would most likely be located downwind of a metropolitan area, quite likely in a suburban residential area where children and other susceptible individuals are likely to be outdoors. Sites located in these areas are most likely to represent an urban scale of measurement. In this example, physical location was determined by considering ozone precursor emission patterns, public activity, and meteorological characteristics affecting ozone formation and dispersion. Thus, spatial scale of representativeness was not used in the selection process but was a result of site location.

              (d) In some cases, the physical location of a site is determined from joint consideration of both the basic monitoring objective and the type of monitoring site desired, or required by this appendix. For example, to determine PM 2.5 concentrations which are typical over a geographic area having relatively high PM 2.5 concentrations, a neighborhood scale site is more appropriate. Such a site would likely be located in a residential or commercial area having a high overall PM 2.5 emission density but not in the immediate vicinity of any single dominant source. Note that in this example, the desired scale of representativeness was an important factor in determining the physical location of the monitoring site.
              (e) In either case, classification of the monitor by its type and spatial scale of representativeness is necessary and will aid in interpretation of the monitoring data for a particular monitoring objective (e.g., public reporting, NAAQS compliance, or research support).
              (f) Table D-1 of this appendix illustrates the relationship between the various site types that can be used to support the three basic monitoring objectives, and the scales of representativeness that are generally most appropriate for that type of site.

              2. General Monitoring Requirements
              (a) The National ambient air monitoring system includes several types of monitoring stations, each targeting a key data collection need and each varying in technical sophistication.
              (b) Research grade sites are platforms for scientific studies, either involved with health or welfare impacts, measurement methods development, or other atmospheric studies. These sites may be collaborative efforts between regulatory agencies and researchers with specific scientific objectives for each. Data from these sites might be collected with both traditional and experimental techniques, and data collection might involve specific laboratory analyses not common in routine measurement programs. The research grade sites are not required by regulation; however, they are included here due to their important role in supporting the air quality management program.
              (c) The NCore multipollutant sites are sites that measure multiple pollutants in order to provide support to integrated air quality management data needs. NCore sites include both neighborhood and urban scale measurements in general, in a selection of metropolitan areas and a limited number of more rural locations. Continuous monitoring methods are to be used at the NCore sites when available for a pollutant to be measured, as it is important to have data collected over common time periods for integrated analyses. NCore multipollutant sites are intended to be long-term sites useful for a variety of applications including air quality trends analyses, model evaluation, and tracking metropolitan area statistics. As such, the NCore sites should be placed away from direct emission sources that could substantially impact the ability to detect area-wide concentrations. The Administrator must approve the NCore sites.
              (d) Monitoring sites designated as SLAMS sites, but not as NCore sites, are intended to address specific air quality management interests, and as such, are frequently single-pollutant measurement sites. The EPA Regional Administrator must approve the SLAMS sites.

              (e) This appendix uses the statistical-based definitions for metropolitan areas provided by the Office of Management and Budget and the Census Bureau. These areas are referred to as metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), micropolitan statistical areas, core-based statistical areas (CBSA), and combined statistical areas (CSA). A CBSA associated with at least one urbanized area of 50,000 population or greater is termed a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). A CBSA associated with at least one urbanized cluster of at least 10,000 population or greater is termed a Micropolitan Statistical Area. CSA consist of two or more adjacent CBSA. In this appendix, the term MSA is used to refer to a Metropolitan Statistical Area. By definition, both MSA and CSA have a high degree of integration; however, many such areas cross State or other political boundaries. MSA and CSA may also cross more than one air shed. The EPA recognizes that State or local agencies must consider MSA/CSA boundaries and their own political boundaries and geographical characteristics in designing their air monitoring networks. The EPA recognizes that there may be situations where the EPA Regional Administrator and the affected State or local agencies may need to augment or to divide the overall MSA/CSA monitoring responsibilities and requirements among these various agencies to achieve an effective network design. Full monitoring requirements apply separately to each affected State or local agency in the absence of an agreement between the affected agencies and the EPA Regional Administrator.
              3. Design Criteria for NCore Sites
              (a) Each State (i.e. the fifty States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) is required to operate at least one NCore site. States may delegate this requirement to a local agency. States with many MSAs often also have multiple air sheds with unique characteristics and, often, elevated air pollution. These States include, at a minimum, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. These States are required to identify one to two additional NCore sites in order to account for their unique situations. These additional sites shall be located to avoid proximity to large emission sources. Any State or local agency can propose additional candidate NCore sites or modifications to these requirements for approval by the Administrator. The NCore locations should be leveraged with other multipollutant air monitoring sites including PAMS sites, National Air Toxics Trends Stations (NATTS) sites, CASTNET sites, and STN sites. Site leveraging includes using the same monitoring platform and equipment to meet the objectives of the variety of programs where possible and advantageous.
              (b) The NCore sites must measure, at a minimum, PM2.5 particle mass using continuous and integrated/filter-based samplers, speciated PM2.5, PM10-2.5 particle mass, O3, SO2, CO, NO/NOY, wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and ambient temperature.
              (1) Although the measurement of NOy is required in support of a number of monitoring objectives, available commercial instruments may indicate little difference in their measurement of NOy compared to the conventional measurement of NOX, particularly in areas with relatively fresh sources of nitrogen emissions. Therefore, in areas with negligible expected difference between NOy and NOX measured concentrations, the Administrator may allow for waivers that permit NOX monitoring to be substituted for the required NOy monitoring at applicable NCore sites.
              (2) The EPA recognizes that, in some cases, the physical location of the NCore site may not be suitable for representative meteorological measurements due to the site's physical surroundings. It is also possible that nearby meteorological measurements may be able to fulfill this data need. In these cases, the requirement for meteorological monitoring can be waived by the Administrator.
              (c) [Reserved]
              (d) Siting criteria are provided for urban and rural locations. Sites with significant historical records that do not meet siting criteria may be approved as NCore by the Administrator. Sites with the suite of NCore measurements that are explicitly designed for other monitoring objectives are exempt from these siting criteria (e.g., a near-roadway site).
              (1) Urban NCore stations are to be generally located at urban or neighborhood scale to provide representative concentrations of exposure expected throughout the metropolitan area; however, a middle-scale site may be acceptable in cases where the site can represent many such locations throughout a metropolitan area.
              (2) Rural NCore stations are to be located to the maximum extent practicable at a regional or larger scale away from any large local emission source, so that they represent ambient concentrations over an extensive area.
              4. Pollutant-Specific Design Criteria for SLAMS Sites
              4.1 Ozone (O3) Design Criteria. (a) State, and where appropriate, local agencies must operate O3 sites for various locations depending upon area size (in terms of population and geographic characteristics) and typical peak concentrations (expressed in percentages below, or near the O3 NAAQS). Specific SLAMS O3 site minimum requirements are included in Table D-2 of this appendix. The NCore sites are expected to complement the O3 data collection that takes place at single-pollutant SLAMS sites, and both types of sites can be used to meet the network minimum requirements. The total number of O3 sites needed to support the basic monitoring objectives of public data reporting, air quality mapping, compliance, and understanding O3-related atmospheric processes will include more sites than these minimum numbers required in Table D-2 of this appendix. The EPA Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency must work together to design and/or maintain the most appropriate O3 network to service the variety of data needs in an area.

                  5 Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) must contain an urbanized area of 50,000 or more population.
              
              (b) Within an O3 network, at least one O3 site for each MSA, or CSA if multiple MSAs are involved, must be designed to record the maximum concentration for that particular metropolitan area. More than one maximum concentration site may be necessary in some areas. Table D-2 of this appendix does not account for the full breadth of additional factors that would be considered in designing a complete O3 monitoring program for an area. Some of these additional factors include geographic size, population density, complexity of terrain and meteorology, adjacent O3 monitoring programs, air pollution transport from neighboring areas, and measured air quality in comparison to all forms of the O3 NAAQS (i.e., 8-hour and 1-hour forms). Networks must be designed to account for all of these area characteristics. Network designs must be re-examined in periodic network assessments. Deviations from the above O3 requirements are allowed if approved by the EPA Regional Administrator.
              (c) The appropriate spatial scales for O3 sites are neighborhood, urban, and regional. Since O3 requires appreciable formation time, the mixing of reactants and products occurs over large volumes of air, and this reduces the importance of monitoring small scale spatial variability.
              (1) Neighborhood scale—Measurements in this category represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region, with dimensions of a few kilometers. Homogeneity refers to pollutant concentrations. Neighborhood scale data will provide valuable information for developing, testing, and revising concepts and models that describe urban/regional concentration patterns. These data will be useful to the understanding and definition of processes that take periods of hours to occur and hence involve considerable mixing and transport. Under stagnation conditions, a site located in the neighborhood scale may also experience peak concentration levels within a metropolitan area.
              (2) Urban scale—Measurement in this scale will be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions of several kilometers to 50 or more kilometers. Such measurements will be used for determining trends, and designing area-wide control strategies. The urban scale sites would also be used to measure high concentrations downwind of the area having the highest precursor emissions.
              (3) Regional scale—This scale of measurement will be used to typify concentrations over large portions of a metropolitan area and even larger areas with dimensions of as much as hundreds of kilometers. Such measurements will be useful for assessing the O3 that is transported to and from a metropolitan area, as well as background concentrations. In some situations, particularly when considering very large metropolitan areas with complex source mixtures, regional scale sites can be the maximum concentration location.
              (d) EPA's technical guidance documents on O3 monitoring network design should be used to evaluate the adequacy of each existing O3 monitor, to relocate an existing site, or to locate any new O3 sites.

              (e) For locating a neighborhood scale site to measure typical city concentrations, a reasonably homogeneous geographical area near the center of the region should be selected which is also removed from the influence of major NOX sources. For an urban scale site to measure the high concentration areas, the emission inventories should be used to define the extent of the area of important nonmethane hydrocarbons and NOX emissions. The meteorological conditions that occur during periods of maximum photochemical activity should be determined. These periods can be identified by examining the meteorological conditions that occur on the highest O3 air quality days. Trajectory analyses, an evaluation of wind and emission patterns on high O3 days, can also be useful in evaluating an O3 monitoring network. In areas without any previous O3 air quality measurements, meteorological and O3 precursor emissions information would be useful.

              (f) Once the meteorological and air quality data are reviewed, the prospective maximum concentration monitor site should be selected in a direction from the city that is most likely to observe the highest O3 concentrations, more specifically, downwind during periods of photochemical activity. In many cases, these maximum concentration O3 sites will be located 10 to 30 miles or more downwind from the urban area where maximum O3 precursor emissions originate. The downwind direction and appropriate distance should be determined from historical meteorological data collected on days which show the potential for producing high O3 levels. Monitoring agencies are to consult with their EPA Regional Office when considering siting a maximum O3 concentration site.
              (g) In locating a neighborhood scale site which is to measure high concentrations, the same procedures used for the urban scale are followed except that the site should be located closer to the areas bordering on the center city or slightly further downwind in an area of high density population.

              (h) For regional scale background monitoring sites, similar meteorological analysis as for the maximum concentration sites may also inform the decisions for locating regional scale sites. Regional scale sites may be located to provide data on O3 transport between cities, as background sites, or for other data collection purposes. Consideration of both area characteristics, such as meteorology, and the data collection objectives, such as transport, must be jointly considered for a regional scale site to be useful.

              (i) Ozone monitoring is required at SLAMS monitoring sites only during the seasons of the year that are conducive to O3 formation (i.e., “ozone season”) as described below in Table D-3 of this appendix. These O3 seasons are also identified in the AQS files on a state-by-state basis. Deviations from the O3 monitoring season must be approved by the EPA Regional Administrator. These requests will be reviewed by Regional Administrators taking into consideration, at a minimum, the frequency of out-of-season O3 NAAQS exceedances, as well as occurrences of the Moderate air quality index level, regional consistency, and logistical issues such as site access. Any deviations based on the Regional Administrator's waiver of requirements must be described in the annual monitoring network plan and updated in AQS. Changes to the O3 monitoring season requirements in Table D-3 revoke all previously approved Regional Administrator waivers. Requests for monitoring season deviations must be accompanied by relevant supporting information. Information on how to analyze O3 data to support a change to the O3 season in support of the 8-hour standard for the entire network in a specific state can be found in reference 8 to this appendix. Ozone monitors at NCore stations are required to be operated year-round (January to December).

              4.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO) Design Criteria

              4.2.1 General Requirements. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), one CO monitor is required to operate collocated with one required near-road NO2 monitor, as required in Section 4.3.2 of this part, in CBSAs having a population of 1,000,000 or more persons. If a CBSA has more than one required near-road NO2 monitor, only one CO monitor is required to be collocated with a near-road NO2 monitor within that CBSA.

              (b) If a state provides quantitative evidence demonstrating that peak ambient CO concentrations would occur in a near-road location which meets microscale siting criteria in Appendix E of this part but is not a near-road NO2 monitoring site, then the EPA Regional Administrator may approve a request by a state to use such an alternate near-road location for a CO monitor in place of collocating a monitor at near-road NO2 monitoring site.
              4.2.2 Regional Administrator Required Monitoring. (a) The Regional Administrators, in collaboration with states, may require additional CO monitors above the minimum number of monitors required in 4.2.1 of this part, where the minimum monitoring requirements are not sufficient to meet monitoring objectives. The Regional Administrator may require, at his/her discretion, additional monitors in situations where data or other information suggest that CO concentrations may be approaching or exceeding the NAAQS. Such situations include, but are not limited to, (1) characterizing impacts on ground-level concentrations due to stationary CO sources, (2) characterizing CO concentrations in downtown areas or urban street canyons, and (3) characterizing CO concentrations in areas that are subject to high ground level CO concentrations particularly due to or enhanced by topographical and meteorological impacts. The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency shall work together to design and maintain the most appropriate CO network to address the data needs for an area, and include all monitors under this provision in the annual monitoring network plan.
              4.2.3 CO Monitoring Spatial Scales. (a) Microscale and middle scale measurements are the most useful site classifications for CO monitoring sites since most people have the potential for exposure on these scales. Carbon monoxide maxima occur primarily in areas near major roadways and intersections with high traffic density and often in areas with poor atmospheric ventilation.
              (1) Microscale—Microscale measurements typically represent areas in close proximity to major roadways, within street canyons, over sidewalks, and in some cases, point and area sources. Emissions on roadways result in high ground level CO concentrations at the microscale, where concentration gradients generally exhibit a marked decrease with increasing downwind distance from major roads, or within downtown areas including urban street canyons. Emissions from stationary point and area sources, and non-road sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale.
              (2) Middle scale—Middle scale measurements are intended to represent areas with dimensions from 100 meters to 0.5 kilometer. In certain cases, middle scale measurements may apply to areas that have a total length of several kilometers, such as “line” emission source areas. This type of emission sources areas would include air quality along a commercially developed street or shopping plaza, freeway corridors, parking lots and feeder streets.
              (3) Neighborhood scale—Neighborhood scale measurements are intended to represent areas with dimensions from 0.5 kilometers to 4 kilometers. Measurements of CO in this category would represent conditions throughout some reasonably urban sub-regions. In some cases, neighborhood scale data may represent not only the immediate neighborhood spatial area, but also other similar such areas across the larger urban area. Neighborhood scale measurements provide relative area-wide concentration data which are useful for providing relative urban background concentrations, supporting health and scientific research, and for use in modeling.
              4.3 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Design Criteria
              4.3.1 General Requirements

              (a) State and, where appropriate, local agencies must operate a minimum number of required NO2 monitoring sites as described below.
              4.3.2 Requirement for Near-road NO2 Monitors
              (a) Within the NO2 network, there must be one microscale near-road NO2 monitoring station in each CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons to monitor a location of expected maximum hourly concentrations sited near a major road with high AADT counts as specified in paragraph 4.3.2(a)(1) of this appendix. An additional near-road NO2 monitoring station is required for any CBSA with a population of 2,500,000 persons or more, or in any CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons that has one or more roadway segments with 250,000 or greater AADT counts to monitor a second location of expected maximum hourly concentrations. CBSA populations shall be based on the latest available census figures.
              (1) The near-road NO2 monitoring sites shall be selected by ranking all road segments within a CBSA by AADT and then identifying a location or locations adjacent to those highest ranked road segments, considering fleet mix, roadway design, congestion patterns, terrain, and meteorology, where maximum hourly NO2 concentrations are expected to occur and siting criteria can be met in accordance with appendix E of this part. Where a state or local air monitoring agency identifies multiple acceptable candidate sites where maximum hourly NO2 concentrations are expected to occur, the monitoring agency shall consider the potential for population exposure in the criteria utilized to select the final site location. Where one CBSA is required to have two near-road NO2 monitoring stations, the sites shall be differentiated from each other by one or more of the following factors: fleet mix; congestion patterns; terrain; geographic area within the CBSA; or different route, interstate, or freeway designation.
              (b) Measurements at required near-road NO2 monitor sites utilizing chemiluminescence FRMs must include at a minimum: NO, NO2, and NOX.
              4.3.3 Requirement for Area-wide NO2 Monitoring
              (a) Within the NO2 network, there must be one monitoring station in each CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons to monitor a location of expected highest NO2 concentrations representing the neighborhood or larger spatial scales. PAMS sites collecting NO2 data that are situated in an area of expected high NO2 concentrations at the neighborhood or larger spatial scale may be used to satisfy this minimum monitoring requirement when the NO2 monitor is operated year round. Emission inventories and meteorological analysis should be used to identify the appropriate locations within a CBSA for locating required area-wide NO2 monitoring stations. CBSA populations shall be based on the latest available census figures.
              4.3.4 Regional Administrator Required Monitoring

              (a) The Regional Administrators, in collaboration with States, must require a minimum of forty additional NO2 monitoring stations nationwide in any area, inside or outside of CBSAs, above the minimum monitoring requirements, with a primary focus on siting these monitors in locations to protect susceptible and vulnerable populations. The Regional Administrators, working with States, may also consider additional factors described in paragraph (b) below to require monitors beyond the minimum network requirement.
              (b) The Regional Administrators may require monitors to be sited inside or outside of CBSAs in which:

              (i) The required near-road monitors do not represent all locations of expected maximum hourly NO2 concentrations in an area and NO2 concentrations may be approaching or exceeding the NAAQS in that area;

              (ii) Areas that are not required to have a monitor in accordance with the monitoring requirements and NO2 concentrations may be approaching or exceeding the NAAQS; or
              (iii) The minimum monitoring requirements for area-wide monitors are not sufficient to meet monitoring objectives.

              (c) The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency should work together to design and/or maintain the most appropriate NO2 network to address the data needs for an area, and include all monitors under this provision in the annual monitoring network plan.
              4.3.5 NO2 Monitoring Spatial Scales
              (a) The most important spatial scale for near-road NO2 monitoring stations to effectively characterize the maximum expected hourly NO2 concentration due to mobile source emissions on major roadways is the microscale. The most important spatial scales for other monitoring stations characterizing maximum expected hourly NO2 concentrations are the microscale and middle scale. The most important spatial scale for area-wide monitoring of high NO2 concentrations is the neighborhood scale.
              (1) Microscale—This scale represents areas in close proximity to major roadways or point and area sources. Emissions from roadways result in high ground level NO2 concentrations at the microscale, where concentration gradients generally exhibit a marked decrease with increasing downwind distance from major roads. As noted in appendix E of this part, near-road NO2 monitoring stations are required to be within 50 meters of target road segments in order to measure expected peak concentrations. Emissions from stationary point and area sources, and non-road sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. The microscale typically represents an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters.
              (2) Middle scale—This scale generally represents air quality levels in areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions on the order of approximately 100 meters to 500 meters. The middle scale may include locations of expected maximum hourly concentrations due to proximity to major NO2 point, area, and/or non-road sources.
              (3) Neighborhood scale—The neighborhood scale represents air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Emissions from stationary point and area sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high NO2 concentrations at the neighborhood scale. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate NO2 sources, the site may be useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.
              (4) Urban scale—Measurements in this scale would be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Urban scale sites may also support other monitoring objectives of the NO2 monitoring network identified in paragraph 4.3.4 above.
              4.3.6 NOy Monitoring
              (a) NO/NOy measurements are included within the NCore multi-pollutant site requirements and the PAMS program. These NO/NOy measurements will produce conservative estimates for NO2 that can be used to ensure tracking continued compliance with the NO2 NAAQS. NO/NOy monitors are used at these sites because it is important to collect data on total reactive nitrogen species for understanding O3 photochemistry.
              4.4 Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Design Criteria.
              4.4.1 General Requirements. (a) State and, where appropriate, local agencies must operate a minimum number of required SO2 monitoring sites as described below.
              4.4.2 Requirement for Monitoring by the Population Weighted Emissions Index. (a) The population weighted emissions index (PWEI) shall be calculated by States for each core based statistical area (CBSA) they contain or share with another State or States for use in the implementation of or adjustment to the SO2 monitoring network. The PWEI shall be calculated by multiplying the population of each CBSA, using the most current census data or estimates, and the total amount of SO2 in tons per year emitted within the CBSA area, using an aggregate of the most recent county level emissions data available in the National Emissions Inventory for each county in each CBSA. The resulting product shall be divided by one million, providing a PWEI value, the units of which are million persons-tons per year. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 1,000,000, a minimum of three SO2 monitors are required within that CBSA. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 100,000, but less than 1,000,000, a minimum of two SO2 monitors are required within that CBSA. For any CBSA with a calculated PWEI value equal to or greater than 5,000, but less than 100,000, a minimum of one SO2 monitor is required within that CBSA.
              (1) The SO2 monitoring site(s) required as a result of the calculated PWEI in each CBSA shall satisfy minimum monitoring requirements if the monitor is sited within the boundaries of the parent CBSA and is one of the following site types (as defined in section 1.1.1 of this appendix): population exposure, highest concentration, source impacts, general background, or regional transport. SO2 monitors at NCore stations may satisfy minimum monitoring requirements if that monitor is located within a CBSA with minimally required monitors under this part. Any monitor that is sited outside of a CBSA with minimum monitoring requirements to assess the highest concentration resulting from the impact of significant sources or source categories existing within that CBSA shall be allowed to count towards minimum monitoring requirements for that CBSA.
              4.4.3 Regional Administrator Required Monitoring. (a) The Regional Administrator may require additional SO2 monitoring stations above the minimum number of monitors required in 4.4.2 of this part, where the minimum monitoring requirements are not sufficient to meet monitoring objectives. The Regional Administrator may require, at his/her discretion, additional monitors in situations where an area has the potential to have concentrations that may violate or contribute to the violation of the NAAQS, in areas impacted by sources which are not conducive to modeling, or in locations with susceptible and vulnerable populations, which are not monitored under the minimum monitoring provisions described above. The Regional Administrator and the responsible State or local air monitoring agency shall work together to design and/or maintain the most appropriate SO2 network to provide sufficient data to meet monitoring objectives.
              4.4.4 SO2
                Monitoring Spatial Scales. (a) The appropriate spatial scales for SO2 SLAMS monitors are the microscale, middle, neighborhood, and urban scales. Monitors sited at the microscale, middle, and neighborhood scales are suitable for determining maximum hourly concentrations for SO2. Monitors sited at urban scales are useful for identifying SO2 transport, trends, and, if sited upwind of local sources, background concentrations.
              (1) Microscale—This scale would typify areas in close proximity to SO2 point and area sources. Emissions from stationary point and area sources, and non-road sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. The microscale typically represents an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters.
              (2) Middle scale—This scale generally represents air quality levels in areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions on the order of approximately 100 meters to 500 meters. The middle scale may include locations of expected maximum short-term concentrations due to proximity to major SO2 point, area, and/or non-road sources.
              (3) Neighborhood scale—The neighborhood scale would characterize air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Emissions from stationary point and area sources may, under certain plume conditions, result in high SO2 concentrations at the neighborhood scale. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate SO2 sources, the site may be useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.
              (4) Urban scale—Measurements in this scale would be used to estimate concentrations over large portions of an urban area with dimensions from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Urban scale sites may also support other monitoring objectives of the SO2 monitoring network such as identifying trends, and when monitors are sited upwind of local sources, background concentrations.
              4.4.5 NCore Monitoring. (a) SO2 measurements are included within the NCore multipollutant site requirements as described in paragraph (3)(b) of this appendix. NCore-based SO2 measurements are primarily used to characterize SO2 trends and assist in understanding SO2 transport across representative areas in urban or rural locations and are also used for comparison with the SO2 NAAQS. SO2 monitors at NCore sites that exist in CBSAs with minimum monitoring requirements per section 4.4.2 above shall be allowed to count towards those minimum monitoring requirements.
              4.5 Lead (Pb) Design Criteria. (a) State and, where appropriate, local agencies are required to conduct ambient air Pb monitoring near Pb sources which are expected to or have been shown to contribute to a maximum Pb concentration in ambient air in excess of the NAAQS, taking into account the logistics and potential for population exposure. At a minimum, there must be one source-oriented SLAMS site located to measure the maximum Pb concentration in ambient air resulting from each non-airport Pb source which emits 0.50 or more tons per year and from each airport which emits 1.0 or more tons per year based on either the most recent National Emission Inventory (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html) or other scientifically justifiable methods and data (such as improved emissions factors or site-specific data) taking into account logistics and the potential for population exposure.
              (i) One monitor may be used to meet the requirement in paragraph 4.5(a) for all sources involved when the location of the maximum Pb concentration due to one Pb source is expected to also be impacted by Pb emissions from a nearby source (or multiple sources). This monitor must be sited, taking into account logistics and the potential for population exposure, where the Pb concentration from all sources combined is expected to be at its maximum.
              (ii) The Regional Administrator may waive the requirement in paragraph 4.5(a) for monitoring near Pb sources if the State or, where appropriate, local agency can demonstrate the Pb source will not contribute to a maximum Pb concentration in ambient air in excess of 50 percent of the NAAQS (based on historical monitoring data, modeling, or other means). The waiver must be renewed once every 5 years as part of the network assessment required under § 58.10(d).
              (iii) State and, where appropriate, local agencies are required to conduct ambient air Pb monitoring near each of the airports listed in Table D-3A for a period of 12 consecutive months commencing no later than December 27, 2011. Monitors shall be sited to measure the maximum Pb concentration in ambient air, taking into account logistics and the potential for population exposure, and shall use an approved Pb-TSP Federal Reference Method or Federal Equivalent Method. Any monitor that exceeds 50 percent of the Pb NAAQS on a rolling 3-month average (as determined according to 40 CFR part 50, Appendix R) shall become a required monitor under paragraph 4.5(c) of this Appendix, and shall continue to monitor for Pb unless a waiver is granted allowing it to stop operating as allowed by the provisions in paragraph 4.5(a)(ii) of this appendix. Data collected shall be submitted to the Air Quality System database according to the requirements of 40 CFR part 58.16.

              (c) The EPA Regional Administrator may require additional monitoring beyond the minimum monitoring requirements contained in paragraph 4.5(a) of this appendix where the likelihood of Pb air quality violations is significant or where the emissions density, topography, or population locations are complex and varied. The EPA Regional Administrators may require additional monitoring at locations including, but not limited to, those near existing additional industrial sources of Pb, recently closed industrial sources of Pb, airports where piston-engine aircraft emit Pb, and other sources of re-entrained Pb dust.
              (d) The most important spatial scales for source-oriented sites to effectively characterize the emissions from point sources are microscale and middle scale. The most important spatial scale for non-source-oriented sites to characterize typical lead concentrations in urban areas is the neighborhood scale. Monitor siting should be conducted in accordance with 4.5(a)(i) with respect to source-oriented sites.
              (1) Microscale—This scale would typify areas in close proximity to lead point sources. Emissions from point sources such as primary and secondary lead smelters, and primary copper smelters may under fumigation conditions likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. In the latter case, the microscale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Pb monitors in areas where the public has access, and particularly children have access, are desirable because of the higher sensitivity of children to exposures of elevated Pb concentrations.
              (2) Middle scale—This scale generally represents Pb air quality levels in areas up to several city blocks in size with dimensions on the order of approximately 100 meters to 500 meters. The middle scale may for example, include schools and playgrounds in center city areas which are close to major Pb point sources. Pb monitors in such areas are desirable because of the higher sensitivity of children to exposures of elevated Pb concentrations (reference 3 of this appendix). Emissions from point sources frequently impact on areas at which single sites may be located to measure concentrations representing middle spatial scales.
              (3) Neighborhood scale—The neighborhood scale would characterize air quality conditions throughout some relatively uniform land use areas with dimensions in the 0.5 to 4.0 kilometer range. Sites of this scale would provide monitoring data in areas representing conditions where children live and play. Monitoring in such areas is important since this segment of the population is more susceptible to the effects of Pb. Where a neighborhood site is located away from immediate Pb sources, the site may be very useful in representing typical air quality values for a larger residential area, and therefore suitable for population exposure and trends analyses.
              (d) Technical guidance is found in references 4 and 5 of this appendix. These documents provide additional guidance on locating sites to meet specific urban area monitoring objectives and should be used in locating new sites or evaluating the adequacy of existing sites.
              4.6 Particulate Matter (PM 10) Design Criteria.>(a) Table D-4 indicates the approximate number of permanent stations required in MSAs to characterize national and regional PM 10 air quality trends and geographical patterns. The number of PM 10 stations in areas where MSA populations exceed 1,000,000 must be in the range from 2 to 10 stations, while in low population urban areas, no more than two stations are required. A range of monitoring stations is specified in Table D-4 because sources of pollutants and local control efforts can vary from one part of the country to another and therefore, some flexibility is allowed in selecting the actual number of stations in any one locale. Modifications from these PM 10 monitoring requirements must be approved by the Regional Administrator.

              (b) Although microscale monitoring may be appropriate in some circumstances, the most important spatial scales to effectively characterize the emissions of PM 10 from both mobile and stationary sources are the middle scales and neighborhood scales.
              (1) Microscale—This scale would typify areas such as downtown street canyons, traffic corridors, and fence line stationary source monitoring locations where the general public could be exposed to maximum PM 10 concentrations. Microscale particulate matter sites should be located near inhabited buildings or locations where the general public can be expected to be exposed to the concentration measured. Emissions from stationary sources such as primary and secondary smelters, power plants, and other large industrial processes may, under certain plume conditions, likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the microscale. In the latter case, the microscale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at microscale sites provide information for evaluating and developing hot spot control measures.
              (2) Middle scale—Much of the short-term public exposure to coarse fraction particles (PM 10) is on this scale and on the neighborhood scale. People moving through downtown areas or living near major roadways or stationary sources, may encounter particulate pollution that would be adequately characterized by measurements of this spatial scale. Middle scale PM 10 measurements can be appropriate for the evaluation of possible short-term exposure public health effects. In many situations, monitoring sites that are representative of micro-scale or middle-scale impacts are not unique and are representative of many similar situations. This can occur along traffic corridors or other locations in a residential district. In this case, one location is representative of a neighborhood of small scale sites and is appropriate for evaluation of long-term or chronic effects. This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as the parking lot and feeder streets associated with shopping centers, stadia, and office buildings. In the case of PM 10, unpaved or seldomly swept parking lots associated with these sources could be an important source in addition to the vehicular emissions themselves.
              (3) Neighborhood scale—Measurements in this category represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface characteristics. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent not only the immediate neighborhood but also neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. Neighborhood scale PM 10 sites provide information about trends and compliance with standards because they often represent conditions in areas where people commonly live and work for extended periods. Neighborhood scale data could provide valuable information for developing, testing, and revising models that describe the larger-scale concentration patterns, especially those models relying on spatially smoothed emission fields for inputs. The neighborhood scale measurements could also be used for neighborhood comparisons within or between cities.
              4.7 Fine Particulate Matter (PM 2.5) Design Criteria.

              4.7.1 General Requirements. (a) State, and where applicable local, agencies must operate the minimum number of required PM 2.5 SLAMS sites listed in Table D-5 of this appendix. The NCore sites are expected to complement the PM 2.5 data collection that takes place at non-NCore SLAMS sites, and both types of sites can be used to meet the minimum PM 2.5 network requirements. Deviations from these PM 2.5 monitoring requirements must be approved by the EPA Regional Administrator.

              (b) Specific Design Criteria for PM 2.5. The required monitoring stations or sites must be sited to represent area-wide air quality. These sites can include sites collocated at PAMS. These monitoring stations will typically be at neighborhood or urban-scale; however, micro-or middle-scale PM 2.5 monitoring sites that represent many such locations throughout a metropolitan area are considered to represent area-wide air quality.
              (1) At least one monitoring station is to be sited at neighborhood or larger scale in an area of expected maximum concentration.

              (2) For CBSAs with a population of 1,000,000 or more persons, at least one PM 2.5 monitor is to be collocated at a near-road NO2 station required in section 4.3.2(a) of this appendix.
              (3) For areas with additional required SLAMS, a monitoring station is to be sited in an area of poor air quality.
              (4) Additional technical guidance for siting PM 2.5 monitors is provided in references 6 and 7 of this appendix.
              

              (c) The most important spatial scale to effectively characterize the emissions of particulate matter from both mobile and stationary sources is the neighborhood scale for PM 2.5. For purposes of establishing monitoring sites to represent large homogenous areas other than the above scales of representativeness and to characterize regional transport, urban or regional scale sites would also be needed. Most PM 2.5 monitoring in urban areas should be representative of a neighborhood scale.
              (1) Micro-scale. This scale would typify areas such as downtown street canyons and traffic corridors where the general public would be exposed to maximum concentrations from mobile sources. In some circumstances, the micro-scale is appropriate for particulate sites. SLAMS sites measured at the micro-scale level should, however, be limited to urban sites that are representative of long-term human exposure and of many such microenvironments in the area. In general, micro-scale particulate matter sites should be located near inhabited buildings or locations where the general public can be expected to be exposed to the concentration measured. Emissions from stationary sources such as primary and secondary smelters, power plants, and other large industrial processes may, under certain plume conditions, likewise result in high ground level concentrations at the micro-scale. In the latter case, the micro-scale would represent an area impacted by the plume with dimensions extending up to approximately 100 meters. Data collected at micro-scale sites provide information for evaluating and developing hot spot control measures.
              (2) Middle scale—People moving through downtown areas, or living near major roadways, encounter particle concentrations that would be adequately characterized by this spatial scale. Thus, measurements of this type would be appropriate for the evaluation of possible short-term exposure public health effects of particulate matter pollution. In many situations, monitoring sites that are representative of microscale or middle-scale impacts are not unique and are representative of many similar situations. This can occur along traffic corridors or other locations in a residential district. In this case, one location is representative of a number of small scale sites and is appropriate for evaluation of long-term or chronic effects. This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as the parking lot and feeder streets associated with shopping centers, stadia, and office buildings.
              (3) Neighborhood scale—Measurements in this category would represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface characteristics. Much of the PM 2.5 exposures are expected to be associated with this scale of measurement. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent the immediate neighborhood as well as neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. PM 2.5 sites of this kind provide good information about trends and compliance with standards because they often represent conditions in areas where people commonly live and work for periods comparable to those specified in the NAAQS. In general, most PM 2.5 monitoring in urban areas should have this scale.
              (4) Urban scale—This class of measurement would be used to characterize the particulate matter concentration over an entire metropolitan or rural area ranging in size from 4 to 50 kilometers. Such measurements would be useful for assessing trends in area-wide air quality, and hence, the effectiveness of large scale air pollution control strategies. Community-oriented PM 2.5 sites may have this scale.
              (5) Regional scale—These measurements would characterize conditions over areas with dimensions of as much as hundreds of kilometers. As noted earlier, using representative conditions for an area implies some degree of homogeneity in that area. For this reason, regional scale measurements would be most applicable to sparsely populated areas. Data characteristics of this scale would provide information about larger scale processes of particulate matter emissions, losses and transport. PM 2.5 transport contributes to elevated particulate concentrations and may affect multiple urban and State entities with large populations such as in the eastern United States. Development of effective pollution control strategies requires an understanding at regional geographical scales of the emission sources and atmospheric processes that are responsible for elevated PM 2.5 levels and may also be associated with elevated O3 and regional haze.
              4.7.2 Requirement for Continuous PM 2.5 Monitoring. The State, or where appropriate, local agencies must operate continuous PM 2.5 analyzers equal to at least one-half (round up) the minimum required sites listed in Table D-5 of this appendix. At least one required continuous analyzer in each MSA must be collocated with one of the required FRM/FEM/ARM monitors, unless at least one of the required FRM/FEM/ARM monitors is itself a continuous FEM or ARM monitor in which case no collocation requirement applies. State and local air monitoring agencies must use methodologies and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures approved by the EPA Regional Administrator for these required continuous analyzers.
              4.7.3 Requirement for PM 2.5 Background and Transport Sites. Each State shall install and operate at least one PM 2.5 site to monitor for regional background and at least one PM 2.5 site to monitor regional transport. These monitoring sites may be at community-oriented sites and this requirement may be satisfied by a corresponding monitor in an area having similar air quality in another State. State and local air monitoring agencies must use methodologies and QA/QC procedures approved by the EPA Regional Administrator for these sites. Methods used at these sites may include non-federal reference method samplers such as IMPROVE or continuous PM 2.5 monitors.
              4.7.4 PM 2.5 Chemical Speciation Site Requirements. Each State shall continue to conduct chemical speciation monitoring and analyses at sites designated to be part of the PM 2.5 Speciation Trends Network (STN). The selection and modification of these STN sites must be approved by the Administrator. The PM 2.5 chemical speciation urban trends sites shall include analysis for elements, selected anions and cations, and carbon. Samples must be collected using the monitoring methods and the sampling schedules approved by the Administrator. Chemical speciation is encouraged at additional sites where the chemically resolved data would be useful in developing State implementation plans and supporting atmospheric or health effects related studies.
              4.8 Coarse Particulate Matter (PM 10-2.5) Design Criteria.

              4.8.1 General Monitoring Requirements. (a) The only required monitors for PM 10-2.5 are those required at NCore Stations.

              (b) Although microscale monitoring may be appropriate in some circumstances, middle and neighborhood scale measurements are the most important station classifications for PM 10-2.5 to assess the variation in coarse particle concentrations that would be expected across populated areas that are in proximity to large emissions sources.
              (1) Microscale—This scale would typify relatively small areas immediately adjacent to: Industrial sources; locations experiencing ongoing construction, redevelopment, and soil disturbance; and heavily traveled roadways. Data collected at microscale stations would characterize exposure over areas of limited spatial extent and population exposure, and may provide information useful for evaluating and developing source-oriented control measures.
              (2) Middle scale—People living or working near major roadways or industrial districts encounter particle concentrations that would be adequately characterized by this spatial scale. Thus, measurements of this type would be appropriate for the evaluation of public health effects of coarse particle exposure. Monitors located in populated areas that are nearly adjacent to large industrial point sources of coarse particles provide suitable locations for assessing maximum population exposure levels and identifying areas of potentially poor air quality. Similarly, monitors located in populated areas that border dense networks of heavily-traveled traffic are appropriate for assessing the impacts of resuspended road dust. This scale also includes the characteristic concentrations for other areas with dimensions of a few hundred meters such as school grounds and parks that are nearly adjacent to major roadways and industrial point sources, locations exhibiting mixed residential and commercial development, and downtown areas featuring office buildings, shopping centers, and stadiums.
              (3) Neighborhood scale—Measurements in this category would represent conditions throughout some reasonably homogeneous urban sub-region with dimensions of a few kilometers and of generally more regular shape than the middle scale. Homogeneity refers to the particulate matter concentrations, as well as the land use and land surface characteristics. This category includes suburban neighborhoods dominated by residences that are somewhat distant from major roadways and industrial districts but still impacted by urban sources, and areas of diverse land use where residences are interspersed with commercial and industrial neighborhoods. In some cases, a location carefully chosen to provide neighborhood scale data would represent the immediate neighborhood as well as neighborhoods of the same type in other parts of the city. The comparison of data from middle scale and neighborhood scale sites would provide valuable information for determining the variation of PM 10-2.5 levels across urban areas and assessing the spatial extent of elevated concentrations caused by major industrial point sources and heavily traveled roadways. Neighborhood scale sites would provide concentration data that are relevant to informing a large segment of the population of their exposure levels on a given day.

              5. Network Design for Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) and Enhanced Ozone Monitoring
              (a) State and local monitoring agencies are required to collect and report PAMS measurements at each NCore site required under paragraph 3(a) of this appendix located in a CBSA with a population of 1,000,000 or more, based on the latest available census figures.
              (b) PAMS measurements include:

              (1) Hourly averaged speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs);
              
              (2) Three 8-hour averaged carbonyl samples per day on a 1 in 3 day schedule, or hourly averaged formaldehyde;
              (3) Hourly averaged O3;

              (4) Hourly averaged nitrogen oxide (NO), true nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and total reactive nitrogen (NOy);
              (5) Hourly averaged ambient temperature;
              (6) Hourly vector-averaged wind direction;
              (7) Hourly vector-averaged wind speed;
              (8) Hourly average atmospheric pressure;
              (9) Hourly averaged relative humidity;
              (10) Hourly precipitation;
              (11) Hourly averaged mixing-height;
              (12) Hourly averaged solar radiation; and
              (13) Hourly averaged ultraviolet radiation.

              (c) The EPA Regional Administrator may grant a waiver to allow the collection of required PAMS measurements at an alternative location where the monitoring agency can demonstrate that the alternative location will provide representative data useful for regional or national scale modeling and the tracking of trends in O3 precursors. The alternative location can be outside of the CBSA or outside of the monitoring agencies jurisdiction. In cases where the alternative location crosses jurisdictions the waiver will be contingent on the monitoring agency responsible for the alternative location including the required PAMS measurements in their annual monitoring plan required under § 58.10 and continued successful collection of PAMS measurements at the alternative location. This waiver can be revoked in cases where the Regional Administrator determines the PAMS measurements are not being collected at the alternate location in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section.
              (d) The EPA Regional Administrator may grant a waiver to allow speciated VOC measurements to be made as three 8-hour averages on every third day during the PAMS season as an alternative to 1-hour average speciated VOC measurements in cases where the primary VOC compounds are not well measured using continuous technology due to low detectability of the primary VOC compounds or for logistical and other programmatic constraints.
              (e) The EPA Regional Administrator may grant a waiver to allow representative meteorological data from nearby monitoring stations to be used to meet the meteorological requirements in paragraph 5(b) where the monitoring agency can demonstrate the data is collected in a manner consistent with EPA quality assurance requirements for these measurements.

              (f) The EPA Regional Administrator may grant a waiver from the requirement to collect PAMS measurements in locations where CBSA-wide O3 design values are equal to or less than 85% of the 8-hour O3 NAAQS and where the location is not considered by the Regional Administrator to be an important upwind or downwind location for other O3 nonattainment areas.
              (g) At a minimum, the monitoring agency shall collect the required PAMS measurements during the months of June, July, and August.
              (h) States with Moderate and above 8-hour O3 nonattainment areas and states in the Ozone Transport Region as defined in 40 CFR 51.900 shall develop and implement an Enhanced Monitoring Plan (EMP) detailing enhanced O3 and O3 precursor monitoring activities to be performed. The EMP shall be submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator no later than October 1, 2019 or two years following the effective date of a designation to a classification of Moderate or above O3 nonattainment, whichever is later. At a minimum, the EMP shall be reassessed and approved as part of the 5-year network assessments required under 40 CFR 58.10(d). The EMP will include monitoring activities deemed important to understanding the O3 problems in the state. Such activities may include, but are not limited to, the following:
              (1) Additional O3 monitors beyond the minimally required under paragraph 4.1 of this appendix,
              (2) Additional NOX or NOy monitors beyond those required under 4.3 of this appendix,
              (3) Additional speciated VOC measurements including data gathered during different periods other than required under paragraph 5(g) of this appendix, or locations other than those required under paragraph 5(a) of this appendix, and
              (4) Enhanced upper air measurements of meteorology or pollution concentrations.

              1. Introduction
              (a) This appendix contains specific location criteria applicable to SLAMS, NCore, and PAMS ambient air quality monitoring probes, inlets, and optical paths after the general location has been selected based on the monitoring objectives and spatial scale of representation discussed in appendix D to this part. Adherence to these siting criteria is necessary to ensure the uniform collection of compatible and comparable air quality data.
              (b) The probe and monitoring path siting criteria discussed in this appendix must be followed to the maximum extent possible. It is recognized that there may be situations where some deviation from the siting criteria may be necessary. In any such case, the reasons must be thoroughly documented in a written request for a waiver that describes how and why the proposed siting deviates from the criteria. This documentation should help to avoid later questions about the validity of the resulting monitoring data. Conditions under which the EPA would consider an application for waiver from these siting criteria are discussed in section 10 of this appendix.
              (c) The pollutant-specific probe and monitoring path siting criteria generally apply to all spatial scales except where noted otherwise. Specific siting criteria that are phrased with a “must” are defined as requirements and exceptions must be approved through the waiver provisions. However, siting criteria that are phrased with a “should” are defined as goals to meet for consistency but are not requirements.
              2. Horizontal and Vertical Placement

              The probe or at least 80 percent of the monitoring path must be located between 2 and 15 meters above ground level for all O3 and SO2 monitoring sites, and for neighborhood or larger spatial scale Pb, PM 10, PM 10-2.5, PM 2.5, NO2, and CO sites. Middle scale PM 10-2.5 sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Microscale Pb, PM 10, PM 10-2.5, and PM 2.5 sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Microscale near-road NO2 monitoring sites are required to have sampler inlets between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. The inlet probes for microscale carbon monoxide monitors that are being used to measure concentrations near roadways must be between 2 and 7 meters above ground level. Those inlet probes for microscale carbon monoxide monitors measuring concentrations near roadways in downtown areas or urban street canyons must be between 2.5 and 3.5 meters above ground level. The probe or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be at least 1 meter vertically or horizontally away from any supporting structure, walls, parapets, penthouses, etc., and away from dusty or dirty areas. If the probe or a significant portion of the monitoring path is located near the side of a building or wall, then it should be located on the windward side of the building relative to the prevailing wind direction during the season of highest concentration potential for the pollutant being measured.
              
              3. Spacing From Minor Sources

              (a) It is important to understand the monitoring objective for a particular location in order to interpret this particular requirement. Local minor sources of a primary pollutant, such as SO2, lead, or particles, can cause high concentrations of that particular pollutant at a monitoring site. If the objective for that monitoring site is to investigate these local primary pollutant emissions, then the site is likely to be properly located nearby. This type of monitoring site would in all likelihood be a microscale type of monitoring site. If a monitoring site is to be used to determine air quality over a much larger area, such as a neighborhood or city, a monitoring agency should avoid placing a monitor probe, path, or inlet near local, minor sources. The plume from the local minor sources should not be allowed to inappropriately impact the air quality data collected at a site. Particulate matter sites should not be located in an unpaved area unless there is vegetative ground cover year round, so that the impact of wind blown dusts will be kept to a minimum.

              (b) Similarly, local sources of nitric oxide (NO) and ozone-reactive hydrocarbons can have a scavenging effect causing unrepresentatively low concentrations of O3 in the vicinity of probes and monitoring paths for O3. To minimize these potential interferences, the probe or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be away from furnace or incineration flues or other minor sources of SO2 or NO. The separation distance should take into account the heights of the flues, type of waste or fuel burned, and the sulfur content of the fuel.
              4. Spacing From Obstructions

              (a) Buildings and other obstacles may possibly scavenge SO2, O3, or NO2, and can act to restrict airflow for any pollutant. To avoid this interference, the probe, inlet, or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must have unrestricted airflow and be located away from obstacles. The distance from the obstacle to the probe, inlet, or monitoring path must be at least twice the height that the obstacle protrudes above the probe, inlet, or monitoring path. An exception to this requirement can be made for measurements taken in street canyons or at source-oriented sites where buildings and other structures are unavoidable.
              (b) Generally, a probe or monitoring path located near or along a vertical wall is undesirable because air moving along the wall may be subject to possible removal mechanisms. A probe, inlet, or monitoring path must have unrestricted airflow in an arc of at least 180 degrees. This arc must include the predominant wind direction for the season of greatest pollutant concentration potential. For particle sampling, a minimum of 2 meters of separation from walls, parapets, and structures is required for rooftop site placement.

              (c) Special consideration must be given to the use of open path analyzers due to their inherent potential sensitivity to certain types of interferences, or optical obstructions. A monitoring path must be clear of all trees, brush, buildings, plumes, dust, or other optical obstructions, including potential obstructions that may move due to wind, human activity, growth of vegetation, etc. Temporary optical obstructions, such as rain, particles, fog, or snow, should be considered when siting an open path analyzer. Any of these temporary obstructions that are of sufficient density to obscure the light beam will affect the ability of the open path analyzer to continuously measure pollutant concentrations. Transient, but significant obscuration of especially longer measurement paths could occur as a result of certain meteorological conditions (e.g., heavy fog, rain, snow) and/or aerosol levels that are of a sufficient density to prevent the open path analyzer's light transmission. If certain compensating measures are not otherwise implemented at the onset of monitoring (e.g., shorter path lengths, higher light source intensity), data recovery during periods of greatest primary pollutant potential could be compromised. For instance, if heavy fog or high particulate levels are coincident with periods of projected NAAQS-threatening pollutant potential, the representativeness of the resulting data record in reflecting maximum pollutant concentrations may be substantially impaired despite the fact that the site may otherwise exhibit an acceptable, even exceedingly high overall valid data capture rate.
              (d) For near-road NO2 monitoring stations, the monitor probe shall have an unobstructed air flow, where no obstacles exist at or above the height of the monitor probe, between the monitor probe and the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment.
              5. Spacing From Trees
              (a) Trees can provide surfaces for SO2, O3, or NO2 adsorption or reactions, and surfaces for particle deposition. Trees can also act as obstructions in cases where they are located between the air pollutant sources or source areas and the monitoring site, and where the trees are of a sufficient height and leaf canopy density to interfere with the normal airflow around the probe, inlet, or monitoring path. To reduce this possible interference/obstruction, the probe, inlet, or at least 90 percent of the monitoring path must be at least 10 meters or further from the drip line of trees.
              (b) The scavenging effect of trees is greater for O3 than for other criteria pollutants. Monitoring agencies must take steps to consider the impact of trees on ozone monitoring sites and take steps to avoid this problem.
              (c) For microscale sites of any air pollutant, no trees or shrubs should be located between the probe and the source under investigation, such as a roadway or a stationary source.

              6.1 Spacing for Ozone Probes and Monitoring Paths
              In siting an O3 analyzer, it is important to minimize destructive interferences form sources of NO, since NO readily reacts with O3. Table E-1 of this appendix provides the required minimum separation distances between a roadway and a probe or, where applicable, at least 90 percent of a monitoring path for various ranges of daily roadway traffic. A sampling site having a point analyzer probe located closer to a roadway than allowed by the Table E-1 requirements should be classified as microscale or middle scale, rather than neighborhood or urban scale, since the measurements from such a site would more closely represent the middle scale. If an open path analyzer is used at a site, the monitoring path(s) must not cross over a roadway with an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day or more. For those situations where a monitoring path crosses a roadway with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day, monitoring agencies must consider the entire segment of the monitoring path in the area of potential atmospheric interference from automobile emissions. Therefore, this calculation must include the length of the monitoring path over the roadway plus any segments of the monitoring path that lie in the area between the roadway and minimum separation distance, as determined from the Table E-1 of this appendix. The sum of these distances must not be greater than 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.
              6.2 Spacing for Carbon Monoxide Probes and Monitoring Paths. (a) Near-road microscale CO monitoring sites, including those located in downtown areas, urban street canyons, and other near-road locations such as those adjacent to highly trafficked roads, are intended to provide a measurement of the influence of the immediate source on the pollution exposure on the adjacent area.
              (b) Microscale CO monitor inlets probes in downtown areas or urban street canyon locations shall be located a minimum distance of 2 meters and a maximum distance of 10 meters from the edge of the nearest traffic lane.
              (c) Microscale CO monitor inlet probes in downtown areas or urban street canyon locations shall be located at least 10 meters from an intersection and preferably at a midblock location. Midblock locations are preferable to intersection locations because intersections represent a much smaller portion of downtown space than do the streets between them. Pedestrian exposure is probably also greater in street canyon/corridors than at intersections.

              6.3 Spacing for Particulate Matter (PM 2.5, PM 10, Pb) Inlets. (a) Since emissions associated with the operation of motor vehicles contribute to urban area particulate matter ambient levels, spacing from roadway criteria are necessary for ensuring national consistency in PM sampler siting.

              (b) The intent is to locate localized hot-spot sites in areas of highest concentrations whether it be from mobile or multiple stationary sources. If the area is primarily affected by mobile sources and the maximum concentration area(s) is judged to be a traffic corridor or street canyon location, then the monitors should be located near roadways with the highest traffic volume and at separation distances most likely to produce the highest concentrations. For the microscale traffic corridor site, the location must be between 5 and 15 meters from the major roadway. For the microscale street canyon site the location must be between 2 and 10 meters from the roadway. For the middle scale site, a range of acceptable distances from the roadway is shown in figure E-1 of this appendix. This figure also includes separation distances between a roadway and neighborhood or larger scale sites by default. Any site, 2 to 15 meters high, and further back than the middle scale requirements will generally be neighborhood, urban or regional scale. For example, according to Figure E-1 of this appendix, if a PM sampler is primarily influenced by roadway emissions and that sampler is set back 10 meters from a 30,000 ADT (average daily traffic) road, the site should be classified as microscale, if the sampler height is between 2 and 7 meters. If the sampler height is between 7 and 15 meters, the site should be classified as middle scale. If the sample is 20 meters from the same road, it will be classified as middle scale; if 40 meters, neighborhood scale; and if 110 meters, an urban scale.
              6.4 Spacing for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Probes and Monitoring Paths.
              (a) In siting near-road NO2 monitors as required in paragraph 4.3.2 of appendix D of this part, the monitor probe shall be as near as practicable to the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment; but shall not be located at a distance greater than 50 meters, in the horizontal, from the outside nearest edge of the traffic lanes of the target road segment.
              (b) In siting NO2 monitors for neighborhood and larger scale monitoring, it is important to minimize near-road influences. Table E-1 of this appendix provides the required minimum separation distances between a roadway and a probe or, where applicable, at least 90 percent of a monitoring path for various ranges of daily roadway traffic. A sampling site having a point analyzer probe located closer to a roadway than allowed by the Table E-1 requirements should be classified as microscale or middle scale rather than neighborhood or urban scale. If an open path analyzer is used at a site, the monitoring path(s) must not cross over a roadway with an average daily traffic count of 10,000 vehicles per day or more. For those situations where a monitoring path crosses a roadway with fewer than 10,000 vehicles per day, monitoring agencies must consider the entire segment of the monitoring path in the area of potential atmospheric interference form automobile emissions. Therefore, this calculation must include the length of the monitoring path over the roadway plus any segments of the monitoring path that lie in the area between the roadway and minimum separation distance, as determined form the Table E-1 of this appendix. The sum of these distances must not be greater than 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.

              7. Cumulative Interferences on a Monitoring Path
              (This paragraph applies only to open path analyzers.) The cumulative length or portion of a monitoring path that is affected by minor sources, trees, or roadways must not exceed 10 percent of the total monitoring path length.
              8. Maximum Monitoring Path Length
              (This paragraph applies only to open path analyzers.) The monitoring path length must not exceed 1 kilometer for analyzers in neighborhood, urban, or regional scale. For middle scale monitoring sites, the monitoring path length must not exceed 300 meters. In areas subject to frequent periods of dust, fog, rain, or snow, consideration should be given to a shortened monitoring path length to minimize loss of monitoring data due to these temporary optical obstructions. For certain ambient air monitoring scenarios using open path analyzers, shorter path lengths may be needed in order to ensure that the monitoring site meets the objectives and spatial scales defined in appendix D to this part. The Regional Administrator may require shorter path lengths, as needed on an individual basis, to ensure that the SLAMS sites meet the appendix D requirements. Likewise, the Administrator may specify the maximum path length used at NCore monitoring sites.
              9. Probe Material and Pollutant Sample Residence Time
              (a) For the reactive gases, SO2, NO2, and O3, special probe material must be used for point analyzers. Studies 20-24 have been conducted to determine the suitability of materials such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, Tygon ®, aluminum, brass, stainless steel, copper, Pyrex ® glass and Teflon ® for use as intake sampling lines. Of the above materials, only Pyrex ® glass and Teflon ® have been found to be acceptable for use as intake sampling lines for all the reactive gaseous pollutants. Furthermore, the EPA 25 has specified borosilicate glass or FEP Teflon ® as the only acceptable probe materials for delivering test atmospheres in the determination of reference or equivalent methods. Therefore, borosilicate glass, FEP Teflon ® or their equivalent must be the only material in the sampling train (from inlet probe to the back of the analyzer) that can be in contact with the ambient air sample for existing and new SLAMs.
              (b) For volatile organic compound (VOC) monitoring at PAMS, FEP Teflon ® is unacceptable as the probe material because of VOC adsorption and desorption reactions on the FEP Teflon ®. Borosilicate glass, stainless steel, or its equivalent are the acceptable probe materials for VOC and carbonyl sampling. Care must be taken to ensure that the sample residence time is kept to 20 seconds or less.

              (c) No matter how nonreactive the sampling probe material is initially, after a period of use reactive particulate matter is deposited on the probe walls. Therefore, the time it takes the gas to transfer from the probe inlet to the sampling device is also critical. Ozone in the presence of nitrogen oxide (NO) will show significant losses even in the most inert probe material when the residence time exceeds 20 seconds. 26 Other studies 27 28 indicate that a 10 second or less residence time is easily achievable. Therefore, sampling probes for reactive gas monitors at NCore and at NO2 sites must have a sample residence time less than 20 seconds.
              10. Waiver Provisions
              Most sampling probes or monitors can be located so that they meet the requirements of this appendix. New sites with rare exceptions, can be located within the limits of this appendix. However, some existing sites may not meet these requirements and still produce useful data for some purposes. The EPA will consider a written request from the State agency to waive one or more siting criteria for some monitoring sites providing that the State can adequately demonstrate the need (purpose) for monitoring or establishing a monitoring site at that location.
              10.1 For establishing a new site, a waiver may be granted only if both of the following criteria are met:
              10.1.1 The site can be demonstrated to be as representative of the monitoring area as it would be if the siting criteria were being met.
              10.1.2 The monitor or probe cannot reasonably be located so as to meet the siting criteria because of physical constraints (e.g., inability to locate the required type of site the necessary distance from roadways or obstructions).
              10.2 However, for an existing site, a waiver may be granted if either of the criteria in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of this appendix are met.
              10.3 Cost benefits, historical trends, and other factors may be used to add support to the criteria in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 of this appendix, however, they in themselves, will not be acceptable reasons for granting a waiver. Written requests for waivers must be submitted to the Regional Administrator.
              11. Summary

              Table E-4 of this appendix presents a summary of the general requirements for probe and monitoring path siting criteria with respect to distances and heights. It is apparent from Table E-4 that different elevation distances above the ground are shown for the various pollutants. The discussion in this appendix for each of the pollutants describes reasons for elevating the monitor, probe, or monitoring path. The differences in the specified range of heights are based on the vertical concentration gradients. For CO and near-road NO2 monitors, the gradients in the vertical direction are very large for the microscale, so a small range of heights are used. The upper limit of 15 meters is specified for the consistency between pollutants and to allow the use of a single manifold or monitoring path for monitoring more than one pollutant.

                  1 Monitoring path for open path analyzers is applicable only to middle or neighborhood scale CO monitoring, middle, neighborhood, urban, and regional scale NO2 monitoring, and all applicable scales for monitoring SO2, O3, and O3 precursors.
                
                  2 When probe is located on a rooftop, this separation distance is in reference to walls, parapets, or penthouses located on roof.
                
                  3 Should be greater than 20 meters from the dripline of tree(s) and must be 10 meters from the dripline when the tree(s) act as an obstruction.
                

                  4 Distance from sampler, probe, or 90 percent of monitoring path to obstacle, such as a building, must be at least twice the height the obstacle protrudes above the sampler, probe, or monitoring path. Sites not meeting this criterion may be classified as middle scale (see text).
                
                  5 Must have unrestricted airflow 270 degrees around the probe or sampler; 180 degrees if the probe is on the side of a building or a wall.
                
                  6 The probe, sampler, or monitoring path should be away from minor sources, such as furnace or incineration flues. The separation distance is dependent on the height of the minor source's emission point (such as a flue), the type of fuel or waste burned, and the quality of the fuel (sulfur, ash, or lead content). This criterion is designed to avoid undue influences from minor sources.
                
                  7 For micro-scale CO monitoring sites, the probe must be >10 meters from a street intersection and preferably at a midblock location.
                
                  8 Collocated monitors must be within 4 meters of each other and at least 2 meters apart for flow rates greater than 200 liters/min or at least 1 meter apart for samplers having flow rates less than 200 liters/min to preclude airflow interference, unless a waiver is in place as approved by the Regional Administrator pursuant to section 3 of Appendix A.

              General Requirements
              1. What Is the AQI?

              The AQI is a tool that simplifies reporting air quality to the general public. The AQI incorporates into a single index concentrations of 5 criteria pollutants: ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The scale of the index is divided into general categories that are associated with health messages.
              2. Why Report the AQI?
              The AQI offers various advantages:
              a. It is simple to create and understand.
              b. It conveys the health implications of air quality.
              c. It promotes uniform use throughout the country.
              3. Must I Report the AQI?
              You must report the AQI daily if yours is a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population over 350,000.
              4. What Goes Into My AQI Report?
              i. Your AQI report must contain the following:
              a. The reporting area(s) (the MSA or subdivision of the MSA).
              b. The reporting period (the day for which the AQI is reported).
              c. The critical pollutant (the pollutant with the highest index value).
              d. The AQI (the highest index value).

              e. The category descriptor and index value associated with the AQI and, if you choose to report in a color format, the associated color. Use only the following descriptors and colors for the six AQI categories:

              ii. When appropriate, your AQI report may also contain the following:
              a. Appropriate health and cautionary statements.
              b. The name and index value for other pollutants, particularly those with an index value greater than 100.
              c. The index values for sub-areas of your MSA.
              d. Causes for unusual AQI values.
              e. Actual pollutant concentrations.
              5. Is My AQI Report for My MSA Only?

              Generally, your AQI report applies to your MSA only. However, if a significant air quality problem exists (AQI greater than 100) in areas significantly impacted by your MSA but not in it (for example, O3 concentrations are often highest downwind and outside an urban area), you should identify these areas and report the AQI for these areas as well.
              6. How Do I Get My AQI Report to the Public?
              You must furnish the daily report to the appropriate news media (radio, television, and newspapers). You must make the daily report publicly available at one or more places of public access, or by any other means, including a recorded phone message, a public Internet site, or facsimile transmission. When the AQI value is greater than 100, it is particularly critical that the reporting to the various news media be as extensive as possible. At a minimum, it should include notification to the media with the largest market coverages for the area in question.
              7. How Often Must I Report the AQI?
              You must report the AQI at least 5 days per week. Exceptions to this requirement are in section 8 of this appendix.
              8. May I Make Exceptions to These Reporting Requirements?
              i. If the index value for a particular pollutant remains below 50 for a season or year, then you may exclude the pollutant from your calculation of the AQI in section 12.
              ii. If all index values remain below 50 for a year, then you may report the AQI at your discretion. In subsequent years, if pollutant levels rise to where the AQI would be above 50, then the AQI must be reported as required in sections 3, 4, 6, and 7 of this appendix.
              Calculation
              9. How does the AQI relate to air pollution levels?

              For each pollutant, the AQI transforms ambient concentrations to a scale from 0 to 500. The AQI is keyed as appropriate to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for each pollutant. In most cases, the index value of 100 is associated with the numerical level of the short-term standard (i.e., averaging time of 24-hours or less) for each pollutant. The index value of 50 is associated with the numerical level of the annual standard for a pollutant, if there is one, at one-half the level of the short-term standard for the pollutant, or at the level at which it is appropriate to begin to provide guidance on cautionary language. Higher categories of the index are based on increasingly serious health effects and increasing proportions of the population that are likely to be affected. The index is related to other air pollution concentrations through linear interpolation based on these levels. The AQI is equal to the highest of the numbers corresponding to each pollutant. For the purposes of reporting the AQI, the sub-indexes for PM 10 and PM 2.5 are to be considered separately. The pollutant responsible for the highest index value (the reported AQI) is called the “critical” pollutant.
              
              10. What monitors should I use to get the pollutant concentrations for calculating the AQI?

              You must use concentration data from State/Local Air Monitoring Station (SLAMS) or parts of the SLAMS required by 40 CFR 58.10 for each pollutant except PM. For PM, calculate and report the AQI on days for which you have measured air quality data (e.g., from continuous PM 2.5 monitors required in Appendix D to this part). You may use PM measurements from monitors that are not reference or equivalent methods (for example, continuous PM 10 or PM 2.5 monitors). Detailed guidance for relating non-approved measurements to approved methods by statistical linear regression is referenced in section 13 below.
              11. Do I Have to Forecast the AQI?
              You should forecast the AQI to provide timely air quality information to the public, but this is not required. If you choose to forecast the AQI, then you may consider both long-term and short-term forecasts. You can forecast the AQI at least 24-hours in advance using the most accurate and reasonable procedures considering meteorology, topography, availability of data, and forecasting expertise. The document “Guideline for Developing an Ozone Forecasting Program” (the Forecasting Guidance) will help you start a forecasting program. You can also issue short-term forecasts by predicting 8-hour ozone values from 1-hour ozone values using methods suggested in the Reporting Guidance, “Guideline for Public Reporting of Daily Air Quality.”
              12. How do I calculate the AQI?
              i. The AQI is the highest value calculated for each pollutant as follows:

              a. Identify the highest concentration among all of the monitors within each reporting area and truncate as follows:
              
              (1) Ozone—truncate to 3 decimal places
              PM 2.5—truncate to 1 decimal place
              PM 10—truncate to integer
              CO—truncate to 1 decimal place
              SO2—truncate to integer
              NO2—truncate to integer
              
              (2) [Reserved]
              b. Using Table 2, find the two breakpoints that contain the concentration.
              c. Using Equation 1, calculate the index.
              d. Round the index to the nearest integer.

                  1 Areas are generally required to report the AQI based on 8-hour ozone values. However, there are a small number of areas where an AQI based on 1-hour ozone values would be more precautionary. In these cases, in addition to calculating the 8-hour ozone index value, the 1-hour ozone index value may be calculated, and the maximum of the two values reported.
                
                  2 8-hour O3 values do not define higher AQI values (>301). AQI values > 301 are calculated with 1-hour O3 concentrations.
                
                  3 If a different SHL for PM2.5 is promulgated, these numbers will change accordingly.
                
                  4 1-hr SO2 values do not define higher AQI values (≥200). AQI values of 200 or greater are calculated with 24-hour SO2 concentration.
              

              ii. If the concentration is equal to a breakpoint, then the index is equal to the corresponding index value in Table 2. However, Equation 1 can still be used. The results will be equal. If the concentration is between two breakpoints, then calculate the index of that pollutant with Equation 1. You must also note that in some areas, the AQI based on 1-hour O3 will be more precautionary than using 8-hour values (see footnote 1 to Table 2). In these cases, you may use 1-hour values as well as 8-hour values to calculate index values and then use the maximum index value as the AQI for O3.
              
                ER27MR08.001
              
              
              Where:
              
              Ip = the index value for pollutantp
              
              Cp = the truncated concentration of pollutantp
              
              BPHi = the breakpoint that is greater than or equal to Cp
              
              BPLo = the breakpoint that is less than or equal to Cp
              
              IHi = the AQI value corresponding to BPHi
              
              Ilo = the AQI value corresponding to BPLo.
              
              iii. If the concentration is larger than the highest breakpoint in Table 2 then you may use the last two breakpoints in Table 2 when you apply Equation 1.
              Example

              iv. Using Table 2 and Equation 1, calculate the index value for each of the pollutants measured and select the one that produces the highest index value for the AQI. For example, if you observe a PM 10 value of 210 µg/m3, a 1-hour O3 value of 0.156 ppm, and an 8-hour O3 value of 0.130 ppm, then do this:
              a. Find the breakpoints for PM 10 at 210 µg/m3 as 155 µg/m3 and 254 µg/m3, corresponding to index values 101 and 150;
              b. Find the breakpoints for 1-hour O3 at 0.156 ppm as 0.125 ppm and 0.164 ppm, corresponding to index values 101 and 150;
              c. Find the breakpoints for 8-hour O3 at 0.130 ppm as 0.116 ppm and 0.374 ppm, corresponding to index values 201 and 300;
              d. Apply Equation 1 for 210 µg/m3, PM 10:
              
                ER27MR08.002
              
              e. Apply Equation 1 for 0.156 ppm, 1-hour O3:
              
                ER27MR08.003
              
              f. Apply Equation 1 for 0.130 ppm, 8-hour O3:
              
                ER27MR08.004
              
              g. Find the maximum, 206. This is the AQI. The minimal AQI report would read:
              v. Today, the AQI for my city is 206 which is Very Unhealthy, due to ozone. Children and people with asthma are the groups most at risk.
              13. What additional information should I know?

              The EPA has developed a computer program to calculate the AQI for you. The program prompts for inputs, and it displays all the pertinent information for the AQI (the index value, color, category, sensitive group, health effects, and cautionary language). The EPA has also prepared a brochure on the AQI that explains the index in detail (The Air Quality Index), Reporting Guidance (Technical Assistance Document for the Reporting of Daily Air Quality—the Air Quality Index (AQI)) that provides associated health effects and cautionary statements, and Forecasting Guidance (Guideline for Developing an Ozone Forecasting Program) that explains the steps necessary to start an air pollution forecasting program.

              § 59.104
              Compliance provisions.
              (a) For the purpose of determining compliance with the VOC content limits in § 59.102(a) of this subpart, each regulated entity shall determine the VOC content of a coating using the procedures described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, as appropriate.
              (1) Determine the VOC content in grams of VOC per liter of coating prepared for application according to its mixing instructions, excluding the volume of any water or exempt compounds. VOC content shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                ER11SE98.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                VOC content = grams of VOC per liter of coating;
                Wv = mass of total volatiles, in grams;
                Ww = mass of water, in grams;
                Wec = mass of exempt compounds, in grams;
                V = volume of coating, in liters;
                Vw = volume of water, in liters; and
                Vec = volume of exempt compounds, in liters.
              
              
              (2) The VOC content of a multi-stage topcoat shall be calculated using the following equation:
              
                EN23NO98.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                VOCmulti = VOC content of a multi-stage topcoat, in grams of VOC per liter of coating;
                VOCbc = VOC content of the basecoat, as determined in paragraph (a)(1) or (f) of this section;
                VOCmci = VOC content of midcoat i, as determined in paragraph (a)(1) or (f) of this section;
                VOCcc = VOC content of the clearcoat, as determined in paragraph (a)(1) or (f) of this section; and
                M = Number of midcoats.
              
              

              (b) To determine the composition of a coating in order to perform the calculations in paragraph (a) of this section, the reference method for VOC content is Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. To determine the VOC content of a coating, the regulated entity may use Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, an alternative method as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, or any other reasonable means for predicting that the coating has been formulated as intended (e.g., quality assurance checks, recordkeeping). However, if there are any inconsistencies between the results of a Method 24 test and any other means for determining VOC content, the Method 24 test results will govern. The Administrator may require the regulated to conduct a Method 24 analysis.
              
              (c) If a regulated entity recommends that its coating component(s) be combined with coating components of another regulated entity, and if the coating resulting from such a combination does not comply with the VOC content limit in § 59.102 (a) of this subpart, then the former regulated entity is out of compliance, unless the entity submits Method 24 data to the Administrator demonstrating that its recommended combination of coating components meets the VOC content limit in § 59.102(a). If the latter regulated entity does not make the recommendation of such use of the coating components, then that entity is not out of compliance for purposes of that resulting coating.
              (d) Pretreatment wash primers: Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the acid weight percent of pretreatment wash primers must be determined using the American Society for Testing and Materials Test Method D 1613-96 (incorporated by reference in § 59.110). If the pigment in a pretreatment wash primer prevents the use of this test method for determining the acid weight percent of the coating, then the test method shall be used for the nonpigmented component of the coating, and the acid weight percent shall be calculated based on the acid content of the nonpigmented component and the mixing ratio of the nonpigmented component to the remaining components recommended by the regulated entity.
              (e) Low-gloss coatings: Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the gloss reading of low-gloss coatings must be determined using the American Society for Testing and Materials Test Method D 523-89 (incorporated by reference in § 59.110).
              (f) The Administrator may approve, on a case-by-case basis, a regulated entity's use of an alternative method in lieu of Method 24 for determining the VOC content of coatings if the alternative method is demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to provide results that are acceptable for purposes of determining compliance with this subpart.
              (g) The Administrator may determine a regulated entity's compliance with the provisions of this subpart based on information required by this subpart or any other information available to the Administrator.

              (b) Upon receipt of a variance application containing the information required in paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator will publish a notice of such application in the Federal Register and, if requested by any party, will hold a public hearing to determine whether, under what conditions, and to what extent, a variance from the requirements of this subpart is necessary and will be granted. If requested, a hearing will be held no later than 75 days after receipt of a variance application. Notice of the time and place of the hearing will be sent to the applicant by certified mail not less than 30 days prior to the hearing. At least 30 days prior to the hearing, the variance application will be made available to the public for inspection. Information submitted to the Administrator by a variance applicant may be claimed as confidential. The Administrator may consider such confidential information in reaching a decision on a variance application. Interested members of the public will be allowed a reasonable opportunity to testify at the hearing.
              (c) The Administrator will issue a variance if the criteria specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) are met to the satisfaction of the Administrator.
              (1) If complying with the provisions of this subpart would not be technologically or economically feasible, and
              (2) The compliance plan proposed by the applicant can reasonably be implemented and will achieve compliance as expeditiously as possible.
              (d) Any variance will specify dates by which the regulated entity will achieve increments of progress towards compliance, and will specify a final compliance date by which the regulated entity will achieve compliance with this subpart.
              (e) A variance will cease to be effective upon failure of the party to whom the variance was issued to comply with any term or condition of the variance.

              (3) How and when to light the lighter material.
              (7) Percent ash means a qualitative observation of the ratio of visible charcoal surface area ignited (grayish/white ash) to total charcoal surface area times 100.
              (8) Reference VOC emissions (Eep)—means the grams (pounds) per start of subject VOC mass emissions (calculated as CH2) resulting from the ignition of charcoal by the reference electric probe during the testing.
              (9) Resultant VOC emissions (Er)—means the ignition VOC emission (EI) less the reference VOC emissions (Eep) plus baseline emissions (Eb).
              (10) Start means a 25-minute period commencing from the instant that emissions may be released from the lighter material, either by evaporation or combustion, and further characterized such that by the end of said 25-minute period, ignition is achieved.
              (f) Test structure, equipment specifications, and reference materials. (1) The test structure is to be located in a building or fabricated total enclosure (i.e., with enclosed sides and top). The enclosure shall be such that there are no constant or intermittent air flows within it that cause fluctuations in the stack velocity and/or disruptions of air flow patterns within the test chamber containing the reference grill . (WARNING: If the stack is vented into the building enclosure, caution must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning and the reduction of oxygen.)
              (2) Test structure components. The following test structure components, as shown in figures 1 and 2 of Appendix A of this subpart, shall be used:

              (xi) Particulate filter—NuproΔ inline filter, Catalog Number SS-4FW-2 with 0.64 centimeter (1/4-inch) Swagelok inlet and outlet or equivalent.
              (xii) Barbecue Grill—The charcoal shall be ignited in a WeberΔ “Go Anywhere” barbecue grill (Model Number #121001), 39.4 centimeters × 24 centimeters × 12.7 centimeters (15.5 inch × 9.5 inch × 5.0 inch) with the grate 4.4 centimeters (1.75 inches) above the bottom of the grill, or another grill that meets these specifications. The grill shall be set on its bottom when placed in the test chamber and all grill air vents shall be in full open position.
              (xiii) Electric probe—A 600-watt electric probe shall be used for electric probe ignition tests.
              (xiv) Untreated charcoal—The laboratory conducting the testing shall purchase “off the shelf” untreated charcoal from a retail outlet. Charcoal shall not be provided by the manufacturer of the charcoal lighter material to be tested or by the charcoal manufacturer. The charcoal to be used is KingsfordΔ “Original Charcoal Briquets.” All untreated charcoal used in the certification testing of a single ignition source is to come from the same lot as indicated by the number printed on the bag.

              (xv) Treated or impregnated charcoal—If the charcoal lighter material to be tested is a substance used to treat or impregnate charcoal, the regulated entity shall provide to the laboratory conducting the tests a sample of impregnated charcoal. The sample shall be impregnated or treated barbecue charcoal that is ignited either outside of package or ignited by the package. If commercially available, the independent testing laboratory conducting the test shall purchase “off the shelf” from a retail outlet.
              (g) Sampling and analytical methods. (1) Gas volumetric flow rate. Conduct a full velocity traverse using the stack velocity measurement device as shown in figure 3 of this Appendix A to this Subpart, or use Method 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Continuously record a velocity reference point reading during each test run using a chart recorder or once every 20 seconds if using Method 1A. Calculate the volumetric flow rate using the gas velocity, moisture content, and the stack cross-sectional area. For the purposes of this protocol, the static pressure shall be assumed to be atmospheric, the molar density correction factor in the stack to be 1.0, and the moisture content to be 2 percent.
              (2) Integrated VOC sample. Collect integrated VOC gas samples at the sampling port in the exhaust stack using a 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 25 Total Combustion Analysis (TCA) sampling apparatus consisting of two evacuated 9-liter tanks, each equipped with flow controllers, vacuum gauges, and probes, as shown in figure 4 of Appendix A of this Subpart. Use 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 25, SCAQMD Method 25.1 (incorporated by reference—§ 59.213 of this subpart), or equivalent, for analysis. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and non-methane organic carbon are analyzed by the TCA and TCA/Flame Ionization Detector (FID) methods. Oxygen content is determined by gas chromatography using a thermal conductivity detector. Clean particulate filters between use by heating to 760 degrees Celsius (1400 degrees Fahrenheit) while using compressed air as a carrier for cleaning and purging.
              (3) Continuous organic emissions monitor. A continuous organic emissions monitor which uses a continuous FID shall be used for each test run to measure the real time organic concentration of the exhaust as methane. Record the emission monitor response in parts per million continuously during the sampling period using a chart recorder or at least once every 10 seconds. The VOC analyzer shall be operated as prescribed in the manufacturer's directions unless otherwise noted in this protocol.
              (h) Pretest procedure. (1) Charcoal lighter material—charcoal. Before each test run, remove charcoal from a sealed bag that has been stored for at least 72 hours in a humidity and temperature controlled room which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section and weight out 0.9 kilograms (2 pounds) of charcoal briquettes, to the nearest whole briquette over 0.9 kilograms (2 pounds), of uniform shape with no broken pieces using an analytical balance. Reseal the bag. Charcoal must be ignited within 10 minutes after removal from bag. A sealed or resealed bag of charcoal cannot be stored at the test site for greater than 45 minutes. It must be returned to a humidity and temperature controlled room from 72 hours. The lighter material must be purchased, stored, weighed, and handled the same as the barbecue charcoal.
              (i) For the reference VOC emission tests using an electric probe, place a single layer of charcoal, slightly larger than the area/circle of the electric probe heating element, onto the grate. Place the heating element on top of this first layer and cover the heating element with the remaining charcoal briquettes.
              (ii) For the ignition VOC emissions tests, arrange the briquettes on the barbecue grate in the manner specified by the ignition manufacturer's directions. If these manufacturer's directions do not specify a stacking arrangement for the briquettes, randomly stack the briquettes in a pile using the stacking ring described in paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section.

              (2) Charcoal lighter material—or impregnated charcoal. Store, handle, weigh, and stack barbecue charcoal that is designed to be lit without the packaging, the same as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. For those products which require both the package and charcoal be lit, weigh the whole package—do not remove charcoal. Weigh an empty package (not the same one to be used during the test). Subtract the package weight from the overall weight of the package and charcoal. The full package and empty package must be stored, handled, and weighed the same as in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the difference (the charcoal weight) is between 0.7 to 1.4 kilograms (1.5 to 3.0 pounds), the test may proceed. The emissions measured (E) in Equation 5 of paragraph (k)(7) of this section must be adjusted to a 0.9 kilogram (2-pound) charge. Place packaged barbecue charcoal on the grate in the manner specified by the manufacturer's directions.
              (3) Initial meteorological and environmental criteria in paragraph (d) shall be complied with.
              (4) The stack velocity must be set before each day of testing at 140 ±9 meters per minute (450 ±30 feet per minute) by performing a velocity traverse as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The velocity will be attained by adjusting the axial fan speed using a rheostat.
              (5) The fireplace shall be conditioned at the start of each day before sampling tests by using a grill ignited by the electric probe. If a time period of over 60 minutes between sampling test runs occur, the condition step must be repeated.
              (6) Before each test run, leak check the continuous organic emissions monitor by blocking the flow to the probe. Allow the instrument to warm up for the duration specified by the manufacturer's directions. Select the 0 to 100 parts per million range. Check the battery level and hydrogen pressure. Zero with hydrocarbon-free air (<0.1 parts per million hydrocarbons as methane) span with 90 parts per million methane in ultra pure air. Zero and span another instrument selection range if needed for test purposes.
              (7) Before the testing program begins, establish a point of average concentration of organics in the stack by using a continuous organic emissions monitor and a grill with charcoal ignited by the electric probe 40 minutes after initial release of emissions. Record the continuous organic emissions monitor traverse data.
              (8) Prepare the integrated VOC sampling equipment and perform the required leak checks. Fit the probes with nozzles housing two micron particulate filters. Insert the probes and nozzles into the sampling port to draw a sample of the exhaust gas from the point of average organic concentration as determined from the continuous organic emissions monitor sample traverse described in paragraph (h)(4) of this section. Also, position the nozzles such that they point downstream in the stack. Obtain the samples concurrently and continuously over the test run.
              (9) Insert the continuous organic emissions monitor probe into the sampling port to draw a sample of the exhaust gas from the point of average organic concentration as determined from the continuous organic emissions monitor sample traverse described in paragraph (h)(7) of this section.
              (i) Test procedure. The labeled directions, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, shall be followed throughout the course of the testing. In cases where the directions are incompatible with this protocol, circumvent the intent of this protocol, or are unclear (subject to different interpretations) and inadequate, the Administrator must be informed in writing of the nature of the conflict, as well as the proposed resolution, prior to commencing testing. When the labeled directions for a charcoal lighter material do not fall within the testing guidelines of this protocol, the protocol may only be modified upon written approval of the Administrator.
              (1) Place the bottom of the barbecue grill on the floor of the fireplace, 5 centimeters (2 inches) from the rear wall. Ignite charcoal as specified by manufacturer's labeled directions.
              (2) For electric probe ignition, carefully remove probe without disturbing charcoal after 10 minutes of operation.
              (3) For fluid ignition, simultaneously match light fluid on charcoal and fluid that has fallen to the bottom of the grill.

              (4) Place the grill temperature probe 11 centimeters (4.5 inches) above the top of the charcoal immediately after the charcoal lighter material flame goes out, or before, if the lighter material does not flame.
              (5) Conduct at least six test runs for both the electric probe ignition and for the lighter material being evaluated. Alternate these lighter material for all 12 runs. All runs must be conducted over 3 consecutive days or less. Alternatively, baseline emissions testing (using the electric probe) may be applied to other test runs provided the test runs occur within 4 months of the baseline testing. Integrated VOC sampling and continuous organic emissions monitoring begin for each test run when the charcoal lighter material and/or materials start to generate/release organics (this will be the time of pouring for lighter fluids and the time of ignition for most other ignition sources). Option: Because the manufacturer of treated or impregnated charcoal supplies both the lighter material and barbecue charcoal, they may apply the 9 grams VOC per start emission limit as an absolute value without an adjustment for the VOC emissions from an electric probe.
              (6) Sampling ends for each test run when all the following conditions are met:
              (i) The temperature 11 centimeters (4.5 inches) above the maximum height of the briquette pile, using the grill temperature probe described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, is at least 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit);
              (ii) The continuous organic emissions monitor is reading below 30 parts per million for at least 2 minutes;
              (iii) The test sampling has continued for 25 minutes (but not more) and
              (iv) The charcoal surface is 70 percent covered with ash (to be documented with photograph on top and 60 degrees above the horizon).
              (7) During the sampling test runs, temperatures (excluding ambient) and continuous organic emission monitor readings shall be recorded and shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. Humidity, wind speed, and ambient temperature readings shall be monitored and shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (8) Collect one blank sample for VOC and one ambient air sample during one run of each day per paragraph (k) of this section.
              (j) Post-run procedure. (1) Record temperatures (including ambient), humidity, wind speed, and continuous organic emissions monitor reading.
              (2) Record the drift using zero and span gases. Leak check and span the continuous organic emissions monitor as described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section for the next run.
              (3) Leak check and disassemble the integrated VOC sampling equipment as described in Method 25 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or SCAQMD Method 25.1 (incorporated by reference—see § 59.213 of this subpart), or equivalent.
              (4) Thoroughly clean grill surfaces of all residue before conducting next ignition run.
              (k) Calculations. Calculations shall be carried out to at least one significant digit beyond that of the acquired data, and then rounded off after final calculation to two significant digits for each run. All rounding off of numbers should be in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 380-93, Standard Practice for Use of the SI International System of Units, procedures (incorporated by reference—see § 59.213 of this subpart).

              Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 59—Determination of Volatile Matter Content of Methacrylate Multicomponent Coatings Used as Traffic Marking Coatings
              1.0 Principle and Applicability

              1.1 Applicability. This modification to Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 applies to the determination of volatile matter content of methacrylate multicomponent coatings used as traffic marking coatings.
              
              1.2 Principle. A known amount of methacrylate multicomponent coating is dispersed in a weighing dish using a stirring device before the volatile matter is removed by heating in an oven.
              2.0 Procedure
              2.1 Prepare about 100 milliliters (mL) of sample by mixing the components in a storage container, such as a glass jar with a screw top or a metal can with a cap. The storage container should be just large enough to hold the mixture. Combine the components (by weight or volume) in the ratio recommended by the manufacturer. Tightly close the container between additions and during mixing to prevent loss of volatile materials. Most manufacturers' mixing instructions are by volume. Because of possible error caused by expansion of the liquid when measuring the volume, it is recommended that the components be combined by weight. When weight is used to combine the components and the manufacturer's recommended ratio is by volume, the density must be determined by section 3.5 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.
              2.2 Immediately after mixing, take aliquots from this 100 mL sample for determination of the total volatile content, water content, and density. To determine water content, follow section 3.4 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. To determine density, follow section 3.5 of Method 24. To determine total volatile content, use the apparatus and reagents described in section 3.8.2 of Method 24 and the following procedures:
              2.2.1 Weigh and record the weight of an aluminum foil weighing dish and a metal paper clip. Using a syringe as specified in section 3.8.2.1 of Method 24, weigh to 1 milligrams (mg), by difference, a sample of coating into the weighing dish. For methacrylate multicomponent coatings used for traffic marking use 3.0 ±0.1 g.
              2.2.2 Add the specimen and use the metal paper clip to disperse the specimen over the surface of the weighing dish. If the material forms a lump that cannot be dispersed, discard the specimen and prepare a new one. Similarly, prepare a duplicate. The sample shall stand for a minimum of 1 hour, but no more than 24 hours before being oven dried at 110 ±5 degrees Celsius for 1 hour.
              2.2.3 Heat the aluminum foil dishes containing the dispersed specimens in the forced draft oven for 60 minutes at 110 ±5 degrees Celsius. Caution—provide adequate ventilation, consistent with accepted laboratory practice, to prevent solvent vapors from accumulating to a dangerous level.
              2.2.4 Remove the dishes from the oven, place immediately in a desiccator, cool to ambient temperature, and weigh to within 1 mg. After weighing, break up the film of the coating using the metal paper clip. Weigh dish to within 1 mg. Return to forced draft oven for an additional 60 minutes at 110 ±5 degrees Celsius.
              2.2.5 Remove the dishes from the oven, place immediately in a desiccator, cool to ambient temperature, and weigh to within 1 mg.
              2.2.6 Run analyses in pairs (duplicate sets for each coating mixture until the criterion in section 4.3 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 is met. Calculate the weight of volatile matter for each heating period following Equation 24-2 of Method 24 and record the arithmetic average. Add the arithmetic average for the two heating periods to obtain the weight fraction of the volatile matter.
              3.0 Data Validation Procedure
              3.1 Follow the procedures in Section 4 of Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
              3.2 If more than 10 percent of the sample is lost when the sample is being broken up in 2.2.4, the sample is invalid.
              4.0 Calculations
              Follow the calculation procedures in Section 5 of Method 24 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.

              § 59.500
              What is the purpose of this subpart?
              This subpart establishes the product-weighted reactivity (PWR) limits regulated entities must meet in order to comply with the national rule for volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted from aerosol coatings. This subpart also establishes labeling, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for regulated entities.
            
            
              § 59.501
              Am I subject to this subpart?
              (a) The regulated entities for an aerosol coating product are the manufacturer or importer of an aerosol coating product and a distributor of an aerosol coating product if it is named on the label or if it specifies the formulation of the product. Distributors include retailers who fall within the definition of “distributor” in § 59.503.
              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the responsibilities of each regulated entity are detailed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section.
              (1) If you are a manufacturer or importer, you are a regulated entity responsible for ensuring that all aerosol coatings manufactured or imported by you meet the PWR limits presented in § 59.504, even if your name is not on the label.
              (2) If you are a distributor named on the label, you are a regulated entity responsible for compliance with all sections of this subpart except for the limits presented in § 59.504. If you are a distributor that has specified formulations to be used by a manufacturer, then you are a regulated entity responsible for compliance with all sections of this subpart.
              (3) If there is no distributor named on the label, then the manufacturer or importer is a regulated entity responsible for compliance with all sections of this subpart.
              (4) If you are a manufacturer, importer, or distributor, you can choose to certify that you will provide any or all of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of §§ 59.510 and 59.511 by following the procedures of § 59.511(g) and (h).
              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the provisions of this subpart apply to aerosol coatings manufactured on or after July 1, 2009, for sale or distribution in the United States.

              (d) You are not a regulated entity under this subpart for the aerosol coatings products that you manufacture (in or outside of the United States) that are exclusively for sale outside the United States.
              (e) If you meet the definition of small quantity manufacturer for a given year, the products you manufacture in that year are not subject to the PWR limits presented in § 59.504 or the labeling requirements of § 59.507. To qualify for this exemption, small aerosol coating manufacturers must comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements in §§ 59.510 and 59.511.
              (f) If you are a person who manufactures or processes aerosol coatings outside of the United States, you may qualify for the small quantity manufacturer exemption in paragraph (e) of this section if you meet the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.
              (1) The total VOC by mass included in all aerosol coatings you manufacture, at all facilities, in a given calendar year, in the aggregate, is less than 7,500 kilograms.
              (2) You comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in §§ 59.510 and 59.511.
              (3) You commit to and comply with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(vii) of this section.

              (i) You must submit an initial notification no later than July 31, 2009, or on or before the date that you start manufacturing aerosol coating products that are sold in the United States, whichever is later. This initial notification must state that you are a foreign manufacturer that is intending to qualify for the small quantity manufacturer exemption in paragraph (e) of this section, provide all of the information specified in § 59.511(b), and provide all the information in paragraphs (f)(3)(i)(A) and (f)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
              (A) The name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address of an agent located in the United States who will serve as your point of contact for communications with EPA.
              (B) The address of each of your facilities that is manufacturing aerosol coatings for sale in the United States.
              (ii) You must notify the Administrator of any changes in the information provided in your initial notification within 30 days following the change.
              (iii) The agent identified above must maintain a copy of the compliance records specified in § 59.510(b). Those records must be kept by the agent such that the agent will be able to provide the written report which must be submitted upon 60 days notice under § 59.511(d) and able to make those records available for inspection and review under § 59.511(e).
              (iv) You must give any EPA inspector or auditor full, complete, and immediate access to your facilities and records to conduct inspections and audits of your manufacturing facilities.
              (v) You must agree that United States substantive and procedural law shall apply to any civil or criminal enforcement action against you under this subpart, and that the forum for any civil or criminal enforcement action under this subpart shall be governed by the CAA, including the EPA administrative forum where allowed under the CAA.
              (vi) Any person certifying any notification, report, or other communication from you to EPA must state in the certification that United States substantive and procedural law shall apply to any civil or criminal enforcement action against him or her under this subpart, and that the forum for any civil or criminal enforcement action under this section shall be governed by the CAA, including the EPA administrative forum where allowed under the CAA.
              (vii) All reports and other communications with EPA must be in English. To the extent that you provide any documents as part of any report or other communication with EPA, an English language translation of that document must be provided with the report or communication.

              § 59.505
              How do I demonstrate compliance with the reactivity limits?
              (a) To demonstrate compliance with the PWR limits presented in Table 1 of this subpart, you must calculate the PWR for each coating as described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (2) of this section:
              (1) Calculate the weighted reactivity factor (WRF) for each propellant and coating component using Equation 1:
              
                ER24MR08.013

                WRFi = weighted reactivity factor of component i, g O3/g component i.
                RFi = reactivity factor of component i, g O3/g component i, from Table 2A, 2B, or 2C.
                WFi = weight fraction of component i in the product,
              
              
              (2) Calculate the PWR of each product using Equation 2:
              
                ER24MR08.014
              
              
                Where:
                
                PWRp = PWR for product P, g O3/g product.
                WRF1 = weighted reactivity factor for component 1, g O3/g component.
                WRF2 = weighted reactivity factor for component 2, g O3/g component.
                WRFn = weighted reactivity factor for component n, g O3/g component.
              
              
              (b) In calculating the PWR, you must follow the guidelines in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section.
              (1) Any ingredient which does not contain carbon is assigned a RF value of 0.
              (2) Any aerosol coating solid, including but not limited to resins, pigments, fillers, plasticizers, and extenders is assigned a RF of 0. These items do not have to be identified individually in the calculation.
              (3) All individual compounds present in the coating in an amount equal to or exceeding 0.1 percent will be considered ingredients regardless of whether or not the ingredient is reported to the manufacturer.
              (4) All individual compounds present in the coating in an amount less than 0.1 percent will be assigned an RF value of 0.
              (5) Any component that is a VOC but is not listed in Table 2A, 2B, or 2C of this subpart is assigned an RF value as detailed in paragraph (e) of this section.

              (c) You may use either formulation data (including information for both the liquid and propellant phases), California Air Resources Board Method 310—Determination of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in Consumer Products and Reactive Organic Compounds in Aerosol Coating Products (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in 59.515), or EPA's Method 311—Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), to calculate the PWR. However, if there are inconsistencies between the formulation data and the California Air Resources Board Method 310 (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in 59.515), or EPA Method 311—Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) results, the California Air Resources Board Method 310 (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in 59.515), or EPA Method 311—Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) results will govern.
              (d) If you manufacture a coating containing either an aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent mixture, you must use the appropriate RF for that mixture provided in Table 2B or 2C of this subpart when calculating the PWR using formulation data. However, when calculating the PWR for a coating containing these mixtures using data from California Air Resources Board Method 310 (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in 59.515), or EPA Method 311—Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), you must identify the individual compounds that are present in the solvent mixture and use the weight fraction of those individual compounds and their RF from Table 2A of this subpart in the calculation.
              (e) If a VOC is used in a product but not listed in Table 2A of this subpart, the Reactivity Factor (RF) is assigned according to paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3) or (e)(4) of this section.
              (1) If the VOC is not listed in Table 2A of this subpart, but has an RF greater than 0.3, the regulated entity may petition EPA to add the VOC to Table 2A, as described in § 59.511(j). Based on these petitions, EPA will periodically update the appropriate table. Once an RF for a VOC is listed on the appropriate table, that RF will be used for that VOC for the purposes of this rule. As provided in § 59.511(j), any petitions submitted to EPA on or before June 1, 2008, will be considered, and if appropriate, incorporated into Table 2A on or before January 1, 2009.
              (2) If the VOC is used in a product but not listed in Table 2A of this regulation, and has an RF less than or equal to 0.3, and will be used at a level greater than or equal to 7.3 weight percent (g of compound/g product) in any of the regulated entity's formulations, the regulated entity may petition EPA as described in § 59.511(j). Based on these petitions, EPA will periodically update the appropriate table. Once an RF for a VOC is listed on the appropriate table, that RF will be used for that VOC for the purposes of this rule. As provided in § 59.511(j), any petition submitted to EPA on or before June 1, 2008 will be considered, and if appropriate, incorporated into Table 2A on or before January 1, 2009.
              (3) If a compound has an RF less than or equal to 0.3, and will not be used at a level greater than or equal to 7.3 weight percent (g of compound/g product) in any of the regulated entity's formulations, the RF to be used in all calculations by that entity for this subpart is 0.
              (4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, if a VOC is not listed in Table 2A of this subpart, it is assigned a default RF factor of 22.04 g O3/g VOC. As described in § 59.511(j), regulated entities may petition the Administrator to add a compound or mixture to Table 2A, 2B, or 2C of this subpart.
              (f) In calculating the PWR value for a coating containing an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent with a boiling range different from the ranges specified in Table 2C of this subpart, you must assign an RF as described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section:
              (1) If the solvent boiling point is lower than or equal to 420 degrees F, then you must use the RF in Table 2C of this subpart specified for bin 23;
              (2) If the solvent boiling point is higher than 420 degrees F, then you must use the RF specified in Table 2C of this subpart for bin 24.
              (g) For purposes of compliance with the PWR limits, all compounds listed in Tables 2A, 2B, or 2C that are used in the aerosol coating products must be included in the calculation. This includes compounds that may otherwise be exempted from the definition of VOC in § 59.100(s).
            
            
              § 59.506
              How do I demonstrate compliance if I manufacture multi-component kits?
              (a) If you manufacture multi-component kits as defined in § 59.503, then the Kit PWR must not exceed the Total Reactivity Limit.

              (b) You must calculate the Kit PWR and the Total Reactivity Limit as follows:
              
              (1) KIT PWR = (PWR(1) × W1) + (PWR(2) × W2) + . ... + (PWR(n) × Wn)
              (2) Total Reactivity Limit = (RL1 × W1) + (RL2 × W2) + ... + (RLn × Wn).
              (3) Kit PWR ≤Total Reactivity Limit.
              
              
                Where:
                
                W = the weight of the product contents (excluding container).
                RL = the PWR Limit specified in Table 1 of this subpart.

              § 59.507
              What are the labeling requirements for aerosol coatings?
              (a) The labels of all aerosol products manufactured on and after the applicable compliance date listed in § 59.502 must contain the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) The aerosol coating category code for the coating, based on the category definitions in § 59.503. This code can be the default category code shown in Table 1 of this subpart or a company-specific code, if that code is explained as required by § 59.511(a);
              (2) The applicable PWR limit for the product specified in Table 1 of this subpart;
              (3) The day, month, and year on which the product was manufactured, or a code indicating such date;
              (4) The name and a contact address for the manufacturer, distributor, or importer that is the regulated entity under this subpart.
              (b) The label on the product must be displayed in such a manner that it is readily observable without removing or disassembling any portion of the product container or packaging. The information may be displayed on the bottom of the container as long as it is clearly legible without removing any product packaging.
            
            
              § 59.508
              What test methods must I use?
              (a) Except as provided in § 59.505(c), you must use the procedures in California Air Resource Board Method 310—Determination of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in Consumer Products and Reactive Organic Compounds in Aerosol Coating Products (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in § 59.515) or EPA's Method 311—Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) to determine the speciated ingredients and weight percentage of each ingredient of each aerosol coating product. EPA Method 311—Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) must be used in conjunction with ASTM Method D3063-94 or D3074-94 for analysis of the propellant portion of the coating. Those choosing to use California Air Resources Board Method 310 (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in § 59.515) must follow the procedures specified in section 5.0 of that method with the exception of section 5.3.1, which requires the analysis of the VOC content of the coating. For the purposes of this subpart, you are not required to determine the VOC content of the aerosol coating. For both California Air Resources Board Method 310 (May 5, 2005) (incorporated by reference in § 59.515) and EPA Method 311—Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), you must have a listing of the VOC ingredients in the coating before conducting the analysis.
              (b) To determine the metal content of metallic aerosol coating products, you must use South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Method 318-95, Determination of Weight Percent Elemental Metal in Coatings by X-ray Diffraction, July, 1996, in 40 CFR part 59 (incorporated by reference in § 59.515).
              To determine the specular gloss of flat and nonflat coatings you must use ASTM Method D523-89 (Reapproved 1999), Standard Test Method for Specular Gloss, in 40 CFR part 59 (incorporated by reference in § 59.515).

              (5) A compliance plan detailing the method(s) by which the regulated entity will achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
              (b) Within 30 days of receipt of the original application and within 30 days of receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted, the Administrator will send a regulated entity written notification of whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination. If an application is incomplete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application, and provide the opportunity for the regulated entity to submit written supplementary information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application. The regulated entity must submit this information to the Administrator within 30 days of being notified that its application is incomplete.
              (c) Within 60 days of receipt of sufficient information to evaluate the application, the Administrator will send a regulated entity written notification of approval or disapproval of a variance application. This 60-day period will begin after the regulated entity has been sent written notification that its application is complete.
              (d) The Administrator will issue a variance if the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section are met to the satisfaction of the Administrator.
              (1) Complying with the provisions of this subpart would not be technologically or economically feasible.
              (2) The compliance plan proposed by the applicant can reasonably be implemented and will achieve compliance as expeditiously as possible.
              (e) A variance must specify dates by which the regulated entity will achieve increments of progress towards compliance, and will specify a final compliance date by which the regulated entity will achieve compliance with this subpart.
              (f) A variance will cease to be effective upon failure of the party to whom the variance was issued to comply with any term or condition of the variance.

                (b) See § 59.602 (a) and (b) to determine how to apply the provisions of this subpart for containers that were manufactured before January 1, 2009.
              
              
                § 59.601
                Do the requirements of this subpart apply to me?
                (a) Unless specified otherwise in this subpart, the requirements and prohibitions of this subpart apply to all manufacturers and importers of portable fuel containers. Certain prohibitions in § 59.602 apply to all other persons.

                (b) New portable fuel containers that are subject to the emissions standards of this part must be covered by a certificate of conformity that is issued to the manufacturer of the container. If more than one person meets the definition of manufacturer for a portable fuel container, see § 59.621 to determine if you are the manufacturer who may apply for and receive a certificate of conformity.
                (c) Unless specifically noted otherwise, the term “you” means manufacturers, as defined in § 59.680.
              
              
                § 59.602
                What are the general prohibitions and requirements of this subpart?
                (a) General prohibition for manufacturers and importers. No manufacturer or importer may sell, offer for sale, introduce or deliver for introduction into commerce in the United States, or import any new portable fuel container that is subject to the emissions standards of this subpart and is manufactured after December 31, 2008 unless it is covered by a valid certificate of conformity, it is labeled as required, and it complies with all of the applicable requirements of this subpart, including compliance with the emissions standards for its useful life. After June 30, 2009, no manufacturer or importer may sell, offer for sale, introduce or deliver into commerce in the United States, or import any new portable fuel container that was manufactured prior to January 1, 2009 unless it meets the requirements of this subpart.
                (b) General prohibition for wholesale distributors. No wholesale distributor may sell, offer for sale, or distribute any portable fuel container in the United States that is subject to the emissions standards of this subpart and is manufactured after December 31, 2008 unless it is covered by a valid certificate of conformity and is labeled as required. After December 31, 2009, no wholesale distributor may sell, offer for sale, or distribute in the United States any portable fuel container that was manufactured prior to January 1, 2009 unless it meets the requirements of this subpart. After December 31, 2009, all new portable fuel containers shall be deemed to be manufactured after December 31, 2008 unless they are in retail inventory.
                (c) Reporting and recordkeeping. (1) You must keep the records and submit the reports specified in § 59.628. Records must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of manufacture or importation and must be supplied to EPA upon request.
                (2) No person may alter, destroy, or falsify any record or report required by this subpart.
                (d) Testing and access to facilities. You may not keep us from entering your facility to observe tests or inspect facilities if we are authorized to do so. Also, you must perform the tests we require (or have the tests done for you). Failure to perform this testing is prohibited.
                (e) Warranty. You may not fail to offer, provide notice of, or honor the emissions warranty required under this subpart.
                (f) Replacement components. No person may sell, offer for sale, introduce or deliver for introduction into commerce in the United States, import, or install any replacement component for portable fuel containers subject to the standards of this subpart where the component has the effect of disabling, bypassing, or rendering inoperative the emissions controls of the containers.
                (g) Violations. If a person violates any prohibition or requirement of this subpart or the Act concerning portable fuel containers, it shall be considered a separate violation for each portable fuel container.
                (h) Assessment of penalties and injunctions. We may assess administrative penalties, bring a civil action to assess and recover civil penalties, bring a civil action to enjoin and restrain violations, or bring criminal action as provided by the Clean Air Act.
              
              
                § 59.603
                How must manufacturers apply good engineering judgment?
                (a) In addition to other requirements and prohibitions set forth in this subpart, you must use good engineering judgment for decisions related to any requirements under this subpart. This includes your applications for certification, any testing you do to show that your portable fuel containers comply with requirements that apply to them, and how you select, categorize, determine, and apply these requirements.

                (b) Upon request, you must provide EPA a written description of the engineering judgment in question. Such information must be provided within 15 working days unless EPA specifies a different period of time to respond.
                
                (c) We may reject your decision if it is not based on good engineering judgment or is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements that apply, and we may—
                (1) Suspend, revoke, or void a certificate of conformity if we determine you used incorrect or incomplete information or failed to consider relevant information, or that your decision was not based on good engineering judgment; or
                (2) Notify you that we believe any aspect of your application or other information submission may be incorrect or invalid due to lack of good engineering judgment or other cause. Unless a different period is specified, you will have 30 days to respond to our notice and specifically address our concerns. After considering your information, we will notify you regarding our finding, which may include the actions provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
                (d) If you disagree with our conclusions under paragraph (c) of this section, you may file a request for a hearing with the Designated Compliance Officer as described in § 59.699. In your request, you must specifically state your objections, and include relevant data or supporting analysis. The request must be signed by your authorized representative. If we agree that your request raises a substantial factual issue, we will hold the hearing according to § 59.699.
              
              
                § 59.605
                What portable fuel containers are excluded from this subpart's requirements?
                This section describes exclusions that apply to certain portable fuel containers. The prohibitions and requirements of this subpart do not apply for containers excluded under this section. Exclusions under this section are based on inherent characteristics of the containers. See § 59.660 for exemptions that apply based on special circumstances.
                (a) Containers approved as safety cans consistent with the requirements of 29 CFR 1926.150 through 1926.152 are excluded. Such cans generally have a flash-arresting screens, spring-closing lids and spout covers and have been approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory such as Factory Mutual Engineering Corp. or Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., or Federal agencies such as Bureau of Mines, or U.S. Coast Guard.
                (b) Containers with a nominal capacity of less than 0.25 gallons or more than 10.0 gallons are excluded.
                (c) Containers designed and marketed solely to deliver fuel directly to nonroad engines during engine operation, such as containers with a connection for a fuel line and a reserve fuel area, are considered to be nonroad fuel tanks, and are thus excluded.
              
              
                § 59.607
                Submission of information.
                (a) You are responsible for all statements you make to us related to this subpart F, including information not required during certification. You are required to provide truthful and complete information. This subpart describes the consequences of failing to meet this obligation. The consequences also may include prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 42 U.S.C. 7431(c)(2).
                (b) We may require an officer or authorized representative of your company with knowledge of the information contained in the submittal to approve and sign any submission of information to us, and to certify that all the information submitted is accurate and complete.
              
            
            
              Emission Standards and Related Requirements
              
                § 59.611
                What evaporative emission requirements apply under this subpart?
                (a) Hydrocarbon emissions from portable fuel containers may not exceed 0.3 grams per gallon per day when measured with the test procedures in §§ 59.650 through 59.653. This procedure measures diurnal venting emissions and permeation emissions.
                (b) For the purpose of this section, portable fuel containers include spouts, caps, gaskets, and other parts provided with the container.
                (c) The following general requirements also apply for all portable fuel containers subject to the standards of this subpart:
                (1) Prohibited controls. The following controls are prohibited:
                
                (i) For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control systems so they cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating.

                (ii) For anyone to design, manufacture, or install emission control systems with features that disable, deactivate, reduce effectiveness, or bypass the emission controls, either actively or passively. However, you may include a vent that the operator can open to bypass emission controls if that vent closes automatically (i.e., without operator involvement). You may include such design features if they operate during emission tests described in subpart F of this part. For example, you may include an integrated or external manually activated device in the portable fuel container's design to temporarily relieve pressure, provided that the device is in place during emission testing and closes automatically when not in use.
                (2) Leaks. You must design and manufacture your containers to be free of leaks. This requirement applies when your container is upright, partially inverted, or completely inverted.
                (3) Refueling. You are required to design your portable fuel containers to minimize spillage during refueling to the extent practical. This requires that you use good engineering judgment to avoid designs that will make it difficult to refuel typical vehicle and equipment designs without spillage.
                (d) Portable fuel containers must meet the standards and requirements specified in this subpart throughout the useful life of the container. The useful life of the container is five years beginning on the date of sale to the ultimate purchaser.

                § 59.612
                What emission-related warranty requirements apply to me?
                (a) General requirements. You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser that the new portable fuel container, including all parts of its evaporative emission-control system, is:
                (1) Designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this subpart.
                (2) Is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep it from meeting these requirements.
                (b) Warranty notice and period. Your emission-related warranty must be valid for a minimum of one year from the date of sale to the ultimate purchaser.
                (c) Notice. You must provide a warranty notice with each container.
              
              
                § 59.613
                What operation and maintenance instructions must I give to buyers?
                You must provide the ultimate purchaser of the new portable fuel container written instructions for properly maintaining and using the emission-control system.
              
              
                § 59.615
                How must I label and identify the portable fuel containers I produce?
                This section describes how you must label your portable fuel containers.
                (a) At the time of manufacture, indelibly mark the month and year of manufacture on each container.
                (b) Mold into or affix a legible label identifying each portable fuel container. The label must be:
                (1) Attached so it is not easily removable.
                (2) Secured to a part of the container that can be easily viewed when the can is in use, not on the bottom of the container.
                (3) Written in English.
                (c) The label must include:
                (1) The heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
                (2) Your full corporate name, trademark and warranty contact information.
                (3) A standardized identifier such as EPA's standardized designation for the emission families, the model number, or the part number.
                (4) This statement: “THIS CONTAINER COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA EMISSION REGULATIONS FOR PORTABLE FUEL CONTAINERS (40 CFR Part 59).”.
                (5) This statement: “THE EMISSIONS WARRANTY IS VALID FOR A MINIMUM OF ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF PURCHASE.”.

                (d) You may add information to the emission control information label to identify other emission standards that the container meets or does not meet (such as California standards). You may also add other information to ensure that the portable fuel container will be properly maintained and used.
                (e) You may request that we approve modified labeling requirements in this subpart F if you show that it is necessary or appropriate. We will approve your request if your alternate label is consistent with the requirements of this subpart.
                (f) You may identify the name and trademark of another company instead of their own on your emission control information label, subject to the following provisions:
                (1) You must have a contractual agreement with the other company that obligates that company to take the following steps:
                (i) Meet the emission warranty requirements that apply under § 59.612. This may involve a separate agreement involving reimbursement of warranty-related expenses.
                (ii) Report all warranty-related information to the certificate holder.
                (2) In your application for certification, identify the company whose trademark you will use and describe the arrangements you have made to meet your requirements under this section.
                (3) You remain responsible for meeting all the requirements of this subpart.
              
            
            
              Certifying Emission Families
              
                § 59.621
                Who may apply for a certificate of conformity?
                A certificate of conformity may be issued only to the manufacturer that completes the construction of the portable fuel container. In unusual circumstances, upon a petition by a manufacturer, we may allow another manufacturer of the container to hold the certificate of conformity. However, in order to hold the certificate, the manufacturer must demonstrate day-to-day ability to ensure that containers produced under the certificate will comply with the requirements of this subpart.
              
              
                § 59.622
                What are the general requirements for obtaining a certificate of conformity and producing portable fuel containers under it?
                (a) You must send us a separate application for a certificate of conformity for each emission family. A certificate of conformity for containers is valid from the indicated effective date until the end of the production period for which it is issued. We may require new certification prior to the end of the production period if we finds that containers are not meeting the standards in use during their useful life.
                (b) The application must be written in English and contain all the information required by this subpart and must not include false or incomplete statements or information (see §§ 59.607 and 59.629).
                (c) We may ask you to include less information than we specify in this subpart, as long as you maintain all the information required by § 59.628.
                (d) You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related to your application (see § 59.603).
                (e) An authorized representative of your company must approve and sign the application.
                (f) See § 59.629 for provisions describing how we will process your application.
                (g) If we approve your application, we will issue a certificate that will allow you to produce the containers that you described in your application for a specified production period. Certificates do not allow you to produce containers that were not described in your application, unless we approve the additional containers under § 59.624.
              
              
                § 59.623
                What must I include in my application?
                This section specifies the information that must be in your application, unless we ask you to include less information under § 59.622(c). We may require you to provide additional information to evaluate your application.

                (a) Describe the emission family's specifications and other basic parameters of the emission controls. List each distinguishable configuration in the emission family. Include descriptions and part numbers for all detachable components such as spouts and caps and describe any devices designed for venting pressure, if applicable.
                (b) Describe and explain the method of emission control.
                (c) Describe the products you selected for testing and the reasons for selecting them.
                (d) Describe the test equipment and procedures that you used, including any special or alternate test procedures you used (see § 59.650).
                (e) List the specifications of the test fuel to show that it falls within the required ranges specified in § 59.650.
                (f) Include the maintenance and use instructions and warranty information you will give to the ultimate purchaser of each new portable fuel container (see § 59.613).
                (g) Describe your emission control information label (see § 59.615).
                (h) State that your product was tested as described in the application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and test fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this subpart.
                (i) Present emission data to show your products meet the applicable emission standards. Where applicable, §§ 59.626 and 59.627 may allow you to submit an application in certain cases without new emission data.
                (j) Report all test results, including those from invalid tests or from any other tests, whether or not they were conducted according to the test procedures of §§ 59.650 through 59.653. We may ask you to send other information to confirm that your tests were valid under the requirements of this subpart.
                (k) Unconditionally certify that all the products in the emission family comply with the requirements of this subpart, other referenced parts of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.
                (l) Include estimates of U.S.-directed production volumes.
                (m) Include the information required by other sections of this subpart.

                § 59.624
                How do I amend my application for certification?
                Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your application to include new or modified configurations, subject to the provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of conformity, you may send us an amended application requesting that we include new or modified configurations within the scope of the certificate, subject to the provisions of this section. You must amend your application if any changes occur with respect to any information included in your application.
                (a) You must amend your application before you take either of the following actions:
                (1) Add a configuration to an emission family. In this case, the configuration added must be consistent with other configurations in the emission family with respect to the criteria listed in § 59.625.
                (2) Change a configuration already included in an emission family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the components you described in your application for certification. This includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any time during the portable fuel containers' lifetime.
                (b) To amend your application for certification, send the Designated Compliance Officer the following information:
                (1) Describe in detail the addition or change in the configuration you intend to make.
                (2) Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended emission family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this by showing that the original emission data are still appropriate with respect to showing compliance of the amended family with all applicable requirements.

                (3) If the original emission data for the emission family are not appropriate to show compliance for the new or modified configuration, include new test data showing that the new or modified configuration meets the requirements of this subpart.
                (c) We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You must give us these within 30 days after we request them.
                (d) For emission families already covered by a certificate of conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of conformity covers your new or modified configuration. You may ask for a hearing if we deny your request (see § 59.699).
                (e) For emission families already covered by a certificate of conformity and you send us a request to amend your application, you may sell and distribute the new or modified configuration before we make a decision under paragraph (d) of this section, subject to the provisions of this paragraph. If we determine that the affected configurations do not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease production of the configurations and any containers from the new or modified configuration will not be considered covered by the certificate. In addition, we may require you to recall any affected containers that you have already distributed, including those sold to the ultimate purchasers. Choosing to produce containers under this paragraph (e) is deemed to be consent to recall all containers that we determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide information required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days, you must stop producing the new or modified containers.
              
              
                § 59.625
                How do I select emission families?
                (a) Divide your product line into families of portable fuel containers that are expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout the useful life.
                (b) Group containers in the same emission family if they are the same in all the following aspects:
                (1) Type of material (including pigments, plasticizers, UV inhibitors, or other additives that may affect control of emissions).
                (2) Production method.
                (3) Spout and cap design.
                (4) Gasket material and design.
                (5) Emission control strategy.
                (6) Strategy for venting pressure.
                (c) You may subdivide a group of containers that is identical under paragraph (b) of this section into different emission families if you show the expected emission characteristics are different.
                (d) You may group containers that are not identical with respect to the things listed in paragraph (b) of this section in the same emission family if you show that their emission characteristics will be similar throughout their useful life.
                [72 FR 8533, Feb. 26, 2007, as amended at 80 FR 9089, Feb. 19, 2015]
              
              
                § 59.626
                What emission testing must I perform for my application for a certificate of conformity?
                This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show compliance with the emission standards in § 59.611.
                (a) Test your products using the procedures and equipment specified in §§ 59.650 through 59.653.
                (b) Select an emission-data unit from each emission family for testing. You must test a production sample or a preproduction product that will represent actual production. Select the configuration that is most likely to exceed (or have emissions nearest to) the applicable emission standard. For example, for a family of multilayer portable fuel containers, test the container with the thinnest barrier layer. Test three identical containers.
                (c) We may measure emissions from any of your products from the emission family. You must supply your products to us if we choose to perform confirmatory testing.

                (d) You may ask to use emission data from a previous production period (carryover) instead of doing new tests, but only if the emission-data from the previous production period remains the appropriate emission-data unit under paragraph (b) of this section. For example, you may not carryover emission data for your family of containers if you have added a thinner-walled container than was tested previously.
                (e) We may require you to test a second unit of the same or different configuration in addition to the unit tested under paragraph (b) of this section.
                (f) If you use an alternate test procedure under § 59.652 and later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are equivalent to the procedures specified in this subpart, we may reject data you generated using the alternate procedure and base our compliance determination on the later testing.
              
              
                § 59.627
                How do I demonstrate that my emission family complies with evaporative emission standards?
                (a) For purposes of certification, your emission family is considered in compliance with an evaporative emission standard in § 59.611(a) if the test results from all portable fuel containers in the family that have been tested show measured emissions levels that are at or below the applicable standard.
                (b) Your emissions family is deemed not to comply if any container representing that family has test results showing an official emission level above the standard.
                (c) Round the measured emission level to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard.
              
              
                § 59.628
                What records must I keep and what reports must I send to EPA?
                (a) Organize and maintain the following records:
                (1) A copy of all applications and any other information you send us.
                (2) Any of the information we specify in § 59.623 that you were not required to include in your application.
                (3) A detailed history of each emission-data unit. For each emission-data unit, include all of the following:
                (i) The emission-data unit's construction, including its origin and buildup, steps you took to ensure that it represents production containers, any components you built specially for it, and all the components you include in your application for certification.
                (ii) All your emission tests, including documentation on routine and standard tests, as specified in §§ 59.650 through 59.653, and the date and purpose of each test.
                (iii) All tests to diagnose emission-control performance, giving the date and time of each and the reasons for the test.
                (iv) Any other relevant events or information.
                (4) Production figures for each emission family divided by assembly plant.
                (5) If you identify your portable fuel containers by lot number or other identification numbers, keep a record of these numbers for all the containers you produce under each certificate of conformity.
                (b) Keep data from routine emission tests (such as test cell temperatures and relative humidity readings) for one year after we issue the associated certificate of conformity. Keep all other information specified in paragraph (a) of this section for five years after we issue your certificate.
                (c) Store these records in any format and on any media, as long as you can promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. You must keep these records readily available. We may review them at any time.
                (d) Send us copies of any maintenance instructions or explanations if we ask for them.
                (e) Send us an annual warranty report summarizing successful warranty claims by emission family under § 59.612, including the reason for the claim. You must submit the report by July 1 for the preceding calendar year.
              
              
                § 59.629
                What decisions may EPA make regarding my certificate of conformity?
                (a) If we determine your application is complete and shows that the emission family meets all the requirements of this subpart and the Act, we will issue a certificate of conformity for your emission family for the specified production period. We may make the approval subject to additional conditions.

                (b) We may deny your application for certification if we determine that your emission family fails to comply with emission standards or other requirements of this subpart or the Act. Our decision may be based on a review of all information available to us. If we deny your application, we will explain why in writing.
                (c) In addition, we may deny your application or suspend, revoke, or void your certificate if you do any of the following:
                (1) Refuse to comply with any testing or reporting requirements.
                (2) Submit false or incomplete information.
                (3) Render inaccurate any test data.
                (4) Deny us from completing authorized activities (see § 59.698). This includes a failure to provide reasonable assistance.
                (5) Produce portable fuel containers for importation into the United States at a location where local law prohibits us from carrying out authorized activities.
                (6) Fail to supply requested information or amend your application to include all portable fuel containers being produced.
                (7) Take any action that otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act or this subpart.
                (d) If we deny your application or suspend, revoke, or void your certificate, you may ask for a hearing (see § 59.699).
              
              
                § 59.630
                EPA testing.
                We may test any portable fuel container subject to the standards of this subpart.
                (a) Certification and production sample testing. Upon our request, a manufacturer must supply a prototype container or a reasonable number of production samples to us for verification testing. These samples will generally be tested using the full test procedure of § 59.653.
                (b) In-use testing. We may test in-use containers using the test procedure of § 59.653 without preconditioning.
              
              
                § 59.650
                General testing provisions.
                (a) The test procedures of this subpart are addressed to you as a manufacturer, but they apply equally to anyone who does testing for you.
                (b) Unless we specify otherwise, the terms “procedures” and “test procedures” in this subpart include all aspects of testing, including the equipment specifications, calibrations, calculations, and other protocols and procedural specifications needed to measure emissions.
                (c) The specification for gasoline to be used for testing is given in 40 CFR 1065.710. Use the grade of gasoline specified for general testing. Blend this grade of gasoline with reagent grade ethanol in a volumetric ratio of 90.0 percent gasoline to 10.0 percent ethanol. You may use ethanol that is less pure if you can demonstrate that it will not affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards.
                (d) Accuracy and precision of all temperature measurements must be ±2.2 °C or better.
                (e) Accuracy and precision of mass balances must be sufficient to ensure accuracy and precision of two percent or better for emission measurements for products at the maximum level allowed by the standard. The readability of the display may not be coarser than half of the required accuracy and precision.
              
              
                § 59.652
                Other procedures.
                (a) Your testing. The procedures in this subpart apply for all testing you do to show compliance with emission standards, with certain exceptions listed in this section.
                (b) Our testing. These procedures generally apply for testing that we do to determine if your portable fuel containers complies with applicable emission standards. We may perform other testing as allowed by the Act.
                (c) Exceptions. We may allow or require you to use procedures other than those specified in this subpart as follows:
                (1) You may request to use special procedures if your portable fuel containers cannot be tested using the specified procedures. We will approve your request if we determine that it would produce emission measurements that represent in-use operation and we determine that it can be used to show compliance with the requirements of § 59.611.

                (2) You may ask to use emission data collected using other procedures, such as those of the California Air Resources Board. We will approve this only if you show us that using these other procedures do not affect your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission standards. This generally requires emission levels to be far enough below the applicable emission standards so that any test differences do not affect your ability to state unconditionally that your containers will meet all applicable emission standards when tested using the specified test procedures.
                (3) You may request to use alternate procedures that are equivalent to allowed procedures, or more accurate or more precise than allowed procedures.
                (4) You may not use other procedures under this paragraph (c) until we approve your request.
              
              
                § 59.653
                How do I test portable fuel containers?
                You must test the portable fuel container as described in your application, with the applicable spout attached except as otherwise noted. Tighten fittings in a manner representative of how they would be tightened by a typical user.
                (a) Preconditioning for durability. Complete the following steps before an emissions test, in any order, unless we determine that omission of one or more of these durability steps will not affect the emissions from your container.
                (1) Pressure cycling. Perform a pressure test by sealing the container and cycling it between + 13.8 and −1.7 kPa (+2.0 and −0.5 psig) for 10,000 cycles at a rate of 60 seconds per cycle. For this test, the spout may be removed and the pressure applied through the opening where the spout attaches. The purpose of this test is to represent environmental wall stresses caused by pressure changes and other factors (such as vibration or thermal expansion). If your container cannot be tested using the pressure cycles specified by this paragraph (a)(1), you may ask to use special test procedures under § 59.652(c).
                (2) UV exposure. Perform a sunlight-exposure test by exposing the container to an ultraviolet light of at least 24 W/m2 (0.40 W-hr/m2/min) on the container surface for at least 450 hours. Alternatively, the container may be exposed to direct natural sunlight for an equivalent period of time, as long as you ensure that the container is exposed to at least 450 daylight hours.
                (3) Slosh testing. Perform a slosh test by filling the portable fuel container to 40 percent of its capacity with the fuel specified in paragraph (e) of this section and rocking it at a rate of 15 cycles per minute until you reach one million total cycles. Use an angle deviation of + 15° to −15° from level.
                (4) Spout actuation. Perform the following spout actuation and inversion steps at the end on the slosh testing, and at the end of the preconditioning soak.
                (i) Perform one complete actuation/inversion cycle per day for ten days.
                (ii) One actuation/inversion cycle consists of the following steps:
                (A) Remove and replace the spout to simulate filling the container.
                (B) Slowly invert the container and keep it inverted for at least 5 seconds to ensure that the spout and mechanisms become saturated with fuel. Any fuel leaking from any part of the container will denote a leak and must be reported as part of certification. Once completed, place the container on a flat surface in the upright position.
                (C) Actuate the spout by fully opening and closing without dispensing fuel. The spout must return to the closed position without the aid of the operator (e.g., pushing or pulling the spout closed). Repeat for a total of 10 actuations. If at any point the spout fails to return to the closed position, the container fails the test.
                (D) Repeat the step contained in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section (i.e., the inversion step).
                (E) Repeat the steps contained in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(C) of this section (i.e., ten actuations).
                (b) Preconditioning fuel soak. Complete the following steps before a diurnal emission test:

                (1) Fill the portable fuel container with the specified fuel to its nominal capacity, seal it using the spout, and allow it to soak at 28 ±5 °C for 20 weeks. Alternatively, the container may be soaked for 10 weeks at 43 ±5 °C. You may count the time of the preconditioning steps in paragraph (a) of this section as part of the preconditioning fuel soak, as long as the ambient temperature remains within the specified temperature range and the fuel tank is at least 40 percent full; you may add or replace fuel as needed to conduct the specified durability procedures.
                (2) Pour the fuel out of the container and immediately refill to 50 percent of nominal capacity. Be careful to not spill any fuel on the container. Wipe the outside of the container as needed to remove any liquid fuel that may have spilled on it.
                (3) Install the spout assembly that will be used in the production containers. The spout and other openings (such as vents) on the container must be tested in their open condition unless they close automatically and are unlikely to be left open by the user during typical storage. All manual closures such as caps must be left off the container and spout during testing.
                (c) Reference container. A reference container is required to correct for buoyancy effects that may occur during testing. Prepare the reference tank as follows:
                (1) Obtain a second container of the same model as the test tank. You may not use a container that has previously contained fuel or any other contents that might affect the stability of its mass.
                (2) Fill the reference container with enough dry sand (or other inert material) so that the mass of the reference container is approximately the same as the test container when filled with fuel. Use good engineering judgment to determine how similar the mass of the reference container needs to be to the mass of the test container considering the performance characteristics of your balance.
                (3) Ensure that the sand (or other inert material) is dry. This may require heating the container or applying a vacuum to it.
                (4) Seal the container.
                (d) Diurnal test run. To run the test, take the following steps for a portable fuel container that was preconditioned as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (1) Stabilize the fuel temperature within the portable fuel container at 22.2 °C. Vent the container at this point to relieve any positive or negative pressure that may have developed during stabilization.

                (2) Weigh the sealed reference container and record the weight. Place the reference on the balance and tare it so that it reads zero. Place the sealed test container on the balance and record the difference between the test container and the reference container. This value is Minitial Take this measurement within 8 hours of filling the test container with fuel as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
                (3) Immediately place the portable fuel container within a well ventilated, temperature-controlled room or enclosure. Do not spill or add any fuel.
                (4) Close the room or enclosure.
                (5) Follow the temperature profile in the following table for all portable fuel containers. Use good engineering judgment to follow this profile as closely as possible. You may use linearly interpolated temperatures or a spline fit for temperatures between the hourly setpoints.

                (6) At the end of the diurnal period, retare the balance using the reference container and weigh the portable fuel container. Record the difference in mass between the reference container and the test. This value is Mfinal.
                
                (7) Subtract Mfinal from Minitial and divide the difference by the nominal capacity of the container (using at least three significant figures) to calculate the g/gallon/day emission rate as follows:
                
                Emission rate = (Minitial—Mfinal)/(nominal capacity)/(one day)
                
                (8) Round your result to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard.
                (9) Instead of determining emissions by weighing the container before and after the diurnal temperature cycle, you may place the container in a SHED meeting the specifications of 40 CFR 86.107-96(a)(1) and measure emissions directly. Immediately following the stabilization in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, purge the SHED and follow the temperature profile from paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Start measuring emissions when you start the temperature profile and stop measuring emissions when the temperature profile concludes.
                (e) For metal containers, you may demonstrate for certification that your portable fuel containers comply with the evaporative emission standards without performing the pre-soak or container durability cycles (i.e., the pressure cycling, UV exposure, and slosh testing) specified in this section. For other containers, you may demonstrate compliance without performing the durability cycles specified in this section only if we approve it after you have presented data clearly demonstrating that the cycle or cycles do not negatively impact the permeation rate of the materials used in the containers.
              
            
            
              Special Compliance Provisions
              
                § 59.660
                Exemption from the standards.
                In certain circumstances, we may exempt portable fuel containers from the evaporative emission standards and requirements of § 59.611 and the prohibitions and requirements of § 59.602. You do not need an exemption for any containers that you own but do not sell, offer for sale, introduce or deliver for introduction into U.S. commerce, or import into the United States. Submit your request for an exemption to the Designated Compliance Officer.
                (a) Portable fuel containers that are intended for export only and are in fact exported are exempt provided they are clearly labeled as being for export only. Keep records for five years of all portable fuel containers that you manufacture for export. Any introduction into U.S. commerce of such portable fuel containers for any purpose other than export is considered to be a violation of § 59.602 by the manufacturer. You do not need to request this exemption.
                (b) You may ask us to exempt portable fuel containers that you will purchase, sell, or distribute for the sole purpose of testing them.
                (c) You may ask us to exempt portable fuel containers for the purpose of national security, as long as your request is endorsed by an agency of the federal government responsible for national defense. In your request, explain why you need the exemption.
                (d) You may ask us to exempt containers that are designed and marketed solely for rapidly refueling racing applications which are designed to create a leak proof seal with the target tank or are designed to connect with a receiver installed on the target tank. This exemption is generally intended for containers used to rapidly refuel a race car during a pit stop and similar containers. In your request, explain how why these containers are unlikely to be used for nonracing applications. We may limit these exemptions to those applications that are allowed to use gasoline exempted under 40 CFR 80.200(a).
                (e) EPA may impose reasonable conditions on any exemption, including a limit on the number of containers that are covered by an exemption.
              
              
                § 59.662
                What temporary provisions address hardship due to unusual circumstances?

                What are the provisions for extending compliance deadlines for manufacturers under hardship?
                (a) After considering the circumstances, we may extend the compliance deadline for you to meet new emission standards, as long as you meet all the conditions and requirements in this section.
                (b) To apply for an extension, you must send the Designated Compliance Officer a written request. In your request, show that all the following conditions and requirements apply:
                (1) You have taken all possible business, technical, and economic steps to comply.
                (2) Show that the burden of compliance costs prevents you from meeting the requirements of this subpart by the required compliance date.
                (3) Not having the exemption will jeopardize the solvency of your company.
                (4) No other allowances are available under the regulations in this subpart to avoid the impending violation.
                (c) In describing the steps you have taken to comply under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, include at least the following information:
                (1) Describe your business plan, showing the range of projects active or under consideration.
                (2) Describe your current and projected financial standing, with and without the burden of complying in full with the applicable regulations in this subpart by the required compliance date.
                (3) Describe your efforts to raise capital to comply with regulations in this subpart.
                (4) Identify the engineering and technical steps you have taken or plan to take to comply with regulations in this subpart.
                (5) Identify the level of compliance you can achieve. For example, you may be able to produce containers that meet a somewhat less stringent emission standard than the regulations in this subpart require.
                (d) Include in your request a plan showing how you will meet all the applicable requirements as quickly as possible.
                (e) You must give us other relevant information if we ask for it.

                (f) An authorized representative of your company must sign the request and include the statement: “All the information in this request is true and accurate, to the best of my knowledge.”.
                (g) Send your request for this extension at least nine months before the relevant deadline.

                § 59.664
                What are the requirements for importing portable fuel containers into the United States?
                As specified in this section, we may require you to post a bond if you import into the United States containers that are subject to the standards of this subpart. See paragraph (f) of this section for the requirements related to importing containers that have been certified by someone else.
                (a) Prior to importing containers into the U.S., we may require you to post a bond to cover any potential compliance or enforcement actions under the Clean Air Act if you cannot demonstrate to us that you have assets of an appropriate liquidity readily available in the United States with a value equal to the retail value of the containers that you will import during the calendar year.
                (b) We may set the value of the bond up to five dollars per container.

                (c) You may meet the bond requirements of this section by obtaining a bond from a third-party surety that is cited in the U.S. Department of Treasury Circular 570, “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies” (http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/c570.html#certified).
                (d) If you forfeit some or all of your bond in an enforcement action, you must post any appropriate bond for continuing importation within 90 days after you forfeit the bond amount.
                (e) You will forfeit the proceeds of the bond posted under this section if you need to satisfy any United States administrative final order or judicial judgment against you arising from your conduct in violation of this subpart.
                (f) This paragraph (f) applies if you import for resale containers that have been certified by someone else. You and the certificate holder are each responsible for compliance with the requirements of this subpart and the Clean Air Act. No bond is required under this section if either you or the certificate holder meet the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section. Otherwise, the importer must comply with the bond requirements of this section.

                (b) We will store your confidential information as described in 40 CFR part 2. Also, we will disclose it only as specified in 40 CFR part 2. This applies both to any information you send us and to any information we collect from inspections, audits, or other site visits.
                (c) If you send us a second copy without the confidential information, we will assume it contains nothing confidential whenever we need to release information from it.

                § 59.698
                May EPA enter my facilities for inspections?
                (a) We may inspect your portable fuel containers, testing, manufacturing processes, storage facilities (including port facilities for imported containers or other relevant facilities), or records, as authorized by the Act, to enforce the provisions of this subpart. Inspectors will have authorizing credentials and will limit inspections to reasonable times—usually, normal operating hours.
                (b) If we come to inspect, we may or may not have a warrant or court order.
                (1) If we do not have a warrant or court order, you may deny us entry.
                (2) If we have a warrant or court order, you must allow us to enter the facility and carry out the activities it describes.
                (c) We may seek a warrant or court order authorizing an inspection described in this section, whether or not we first tried to get your permission to inspect.
                (d) We may select any facility to do any of the following:
                (1) Inspect and monitor any aspect of portable fuel container manufacturing, assembly, storage, or other procedures, and any facilities where you do them.
                (2) Inspect and monitor any aspect of test procedures or test-related activities, including test container selection, preparation, durability cycles, and maintenance and verification of your test equipment's calibration.
                (3) Inspect and copy records or documents related to assembling, storing, selecting, and testing a container.

                (4) Inspect and photograph any part or aspect of containers or components use for assembly.
                
                (e) You must give us reasonable help without charge during an inspection authorized by the Act. For example, you may need to help us arrange an inspection with the facility's managers, including clerical support, copying, and translation. You may also need to show us how the facility operates and answer other questions. If we ask in writing to see a particular employee at the inspection, you must ensure that he or she is present (legal counsel may accompany the employee).
                (f) If you have facilities in other countries, we expect you to locate them in places where local law does not keep us from inspecting as described in this section. We will not try to inspect if we learn that local law prohibits it, but we may suspend your certificate if we are not allowed to inspect.
              
              
                § 59.699

To do this, you must file a written request with the Designated Compliance Officer, including a description of your objection and any supporting data, within 30 days after we make a decision.
                (b) For a hearing you request under the provisions of this subpart, we will approve your request if we find that your request raises a substantial factual issue.
