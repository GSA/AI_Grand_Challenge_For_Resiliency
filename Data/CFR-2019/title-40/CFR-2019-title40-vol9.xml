      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.</P>
            <P>Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in appendix B.</P>
            <P>Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.</P>
            <P>The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.</P>

            <P>Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to <PRTPAGE P="6"/>specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.</P>
            <P>Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <P>1.1 Measured Parameters. The purpose of the method is to provide guidance for the selection of sampling ports and traverse points at which sampling for air pollutants will be performed pursuant to regulations set forth in this part. Two procedures are presented: a simplified procedure, and an alternative procedure (see section 11.5). The magnitude of cyclonic flow of effluent gas in a stack or duct is the only parameter quantitatively measured in the simplified procedure.</P>
            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable to gas streams flowing in ducts, stacks, and flues. This method cannot be used when: (1) the flow is cyclonic or swirling; or (2) a stack is smaller than 0.30 meter (12 in.) in diameter, or 0.071 m<SU>2</SU> (113 in.<SU>2</SU>) in cross-sectional area. The simplified procedure cannot be used when the measurement site is less than two stack or duct diameters downstream or less than a half diameter upstream from a flow disturbance.</P>

            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

Traverse points are then located within each of these equal areas.</P>

Before using the probe, assign an identification number to the <PRTPAGE P="7"/>directional probe, and permanently mark or engrave the number on the body of the probe. The pressure holes of directional probes are susceptible to plugging when used in particulate-laden gas streams. Therefore, a procedure for cleaning the pressure holes by “back-purging” with pressurized air is required.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Procedure</HD>
            <P>11.1 Selection of Measurement Site.</P>
            <P>11.1.1 Sampling and/or velocity measurements are performed at a site located at least eight stack or duct diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion, or contraction in the stack, or from a visible flame. If necessary, an alternative location may be selected, at a position at least two stack or duct diameters downstream and a half diameter upstream from any flow disturbance.</P>
            <P>11.1.2 An alternative procedure is available for determining the acceptability of a measurement location not meeting the criteria above. This procedure described in section 11.5 allows for the determination of gas flow angles at the sampling points and comparison of the measured results with acceptability criteria.</P>
            <P>11.2 Determining the Number of Traverse Points.</P>
            <P>11.2.1 Particulate Traverses.</P>
            <P>11.2.1.1 When the eight- and two-diameter criterion can be met, the minimum number of traverse points shall be: (1) twelve, for circular or rectangular stacks with diameters (or equivalent diameters) greater than 0.61 meter (24 in.); (2) eight, for circular stacks with diameters between 0.30 and 0.61 meter (12 and 24 in.); and (3) nine, for rectangular stacks with equivalent diameters between 0.30 and 0.61 meter (12 and 24 in.).</P>
            <P>11.2.1.2 When the eight- and two-diameter criterion cannot be met, the minimum number of traverse points is determined from Figure 1-1. Before referring to the figure, however, determine the distances from the measurement site to the nearest upstream and downstream disturbances, and divide each distance by the stack diameter or equivalent diameter, to determine the distance in terms of the number of duct diameters. Then, determine from Figure 1-1 the minimum number of traverse points that corresponds:</P>
            <P>(1) To the number of duct diameters upstream; and</P>
            <P>(2) To the number of diameters downstream. Select the higher of the two minimum numbers of traverse points, or a greater value, so that for circular stacks, the number is a multiple of 4, and for rectangular stacks, the number is one of those shown in Table 1-1.</P>
            <P>11.2.2 Velocity (Non-Particulate) Traverses. When velocity or volumetric flow rate is to be determined (but not particulate matter), the same procedure as that used for particulate traverses (Section 11.2.1) is followed, except that Figure 1-2 may be used instead of Figure 1-1.</P>
            <P>11.3 Cross-Sectional Layout and Location of Traverse Points.</P>
            <P>11.3.1 Circular Stacks.</P>
            <P>11.3.1.1 Locate the traverse points on two perpendicular diameters according to Table 1-2 and the example shown in Figure 1-3. Any equation (see examples in References 2 and 3 in section 16.0) that gives the same values as those in Table 1-2 may be used in lieu of Table 1-2.</P>

            <P>11.3.1.2 For particulate traverses, one of the diameters must coincide with the plane containing the greatest expected concentration variation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> after bends); one diameter shall be congruent to the direction of the bend. This requirement becomes less critical as the distance from the disturbance increases; therefore, other diameter locations may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

            <P>11.3.1.3 In addition, for elliptical stacks having unequal perpendicular diameters, separate traverse points shall be calculated and located along each diameter. To determine the cross-sectional area of the elliptical stack, use the following equation:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Square Area = D<E T="52">1</E> × D<E T="52">2</E> × 0.7854</FP>
            
            <FP>Where: D<E T="52">1</E> = Stack diameter 1</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D<E T="52">2</E> = Stack diameter 2</FP>
            
            <P>11.3.1.4 In addition, for stacks having diameters greater than 0.61 m (24 in.), no traverse points shall be within 2.5 centimeters (1.00 in.) of the stack walls; and for stack diameters equal to or less than 0.61 m (24 in.), no traverse points shall be located within 1.3 cm (0.50 in.) of the stack walls. To meet these criteria, observe the procedures given below.</P>

            <P>11.3.2 Stacks With Diameters Greater Than 0.61 m (24 in.).<PRTPAGE P="8"/>
            </P>
            <P>11.3.2.1 When any of the traverse points as located in section 11.3.1 fall within 2.5 cm (1.0 in.) of the stack walls, relocate them away from the stack walls to: (1) a distance of 2.5 cm (1.0 in.); or (2) a distance equal to the nozzle inside diameter, whichever is larger. These relocated traverse points (on each end of a diameter) shall be the “adjusted” traverse points.</P>
            <P>11.3.2.2 Whenever two successive traverse points are combined to form a single adjusted traverse point, treat the adjusted point as two separate traverse points, both in the sampling and/or velocity measurement procedure, and in recording of the data.</P>
            <P>11.3.3 Stacks With Diameters Equal To or Less Than 0.61 m (24 in.). Follow the procedure in section 11.3.1.1, noting only that any “adjusted” points should be relocated away from the stack walls to: (1) a distance of 1.3 cm (0.50 in.); or (2) a distance equal to the nozzle inside diameter, whichever is larger.</P>
            <P>11.3.4 Rectangular Stacks.</P>
            <P>11.3.4.1 Determine the number of traverse points as explained in sections 11.1 and 11.2 of this method. From Table 1-1, determine the grid configuration. Divide the stack cross-section into as many equal rectangular elemental areas as traverse points, and then locate a traverse point at the centroid of each equal area according to the example in Figure 1-4.</P>
            <P>11.3.4.2 To use more than the minimum number of traverse points, expand the “minimum number of traverse points” matrix (see Table 1-1) by adding the extra traverse points along one or the other or both legs of the matrix; the final matrix need not be balanced. For example, if a 4 × 3 “minimum number of points” matrix were expanded to 36 points, the final matrix could be 9 × 4 or 12 × 3, and would not necessarily have to be 6 × 6. After constructing the final matrix, divide the stack cross-section into as many equal rectangular, elemental areas as traverse points, and locate a traverse point at the centroid of each equal area.</P>
            <P>11.3.4.3 The situation of traverse points being too close to the stack walls is not expected to arise with rectangular stacks. If this problem should ever arise, the Administrator must be contacted for resolution of the matter.</P>
            <P>11.4 Verification of Absence of Cyclonic Flow.</P>
            <P>11.4.1 In most stationary sources, the direction of stack gas flow is essentially parallel to the stack walls. However, cyclonic flow may exist (1) after such devices as cyclones and inertial demisters following venturi scrubbers, or (2) in stacks having tangential inlets or other duct configurations which tend to induce swirling; in these instances, the presence or absence of cyclonic flow at the sampling location must be determined. The following techniques are acceptable for this determination.</P>
            <P>11.4.2 Level and zero the manometer. Connect a Type S pitot tube to the manometer and leak-check system. Position the Type S pitot tube at each traverse point, in succession, so that the planes of the face openings of the pitot tube are perpendicular to the stack cross-sectional plane; when the Type S pitot tube is in this position, it is at “0° reference.” Note the differential pressure (Δp) reading at each traverse point. If a null (zero) pitot reading is obtained at 0° reference at a given traverse point, an acceptable flow condition exists at that point. If the pitot reading is not zero at 0° reference, rotate the pitot tube (up to ±90° yaw angle), until a null reading is obtained. Carefully determine and record the value of the rotation angle (α) to the nearest degree. After the null technique has been applied at each traverse point, calculate the average of the absolute values of α; assign α values of 0° to those points for which no rotation was required, and include these in the overall average. If the average value of α is greater than 20°, the overall flow condition in the stack is unacceptable, and alternative methodology, subject to the approval of the Administrator, must be used to perform accurate sample and velocity traverses.</P>
            <P>11.5 The alternative site selection procedure may be used to determine the rotation angles in lieu of the procedure outlined in section 11.4.</P>

            <P>11.5.1 Alternative Measurement Site Selection Procedure. This alternative applies to sources where measurement locations are less than 2 equivalent or duct diameters downstream or less than one-half duct diameter upstream from a flow disturbance. The alternative should be limited to ducts larger than 24 in. in diameter where blockage and wall effects are minimal. A directional flow-sensing probe is used to measure pitch and yaw angles of the gas flow at 40 or more traverse points; the resultant angle is calculated and compared with acceptable criteria for mean and standard deviation.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Both the pitch and yaw angles are measured from a line passing through the traverse point and parallel to the stack axis. The pitch angle is the angle of the gas flow component in the plane that INCLUDES the traverse line and is parallel to the stack axis. The yaw angle is the angle of the gas flow component in the plane PERPENDICULAR to the traverse line at the traverse point and is measured from the line passing through the traverse point and parallel to the stack axis.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>11.5.2 Traverse Points. Use a minimum of 40 traverse points for circular ducts and 42 points for rectangular ducts for the gas flow angle determinations. Follow the procedure outlined in section 11.3 and Table 1-1 or 1-2 for the location and layout of the traverse <PRTPAGE P="9"/>points. If the measurement location is determined to be acceptable according to the criteria in this alternative procedure, use the same traverse point number and locations for sampling and velocity measurements.</P>
            <P>11.5.3 Measurement Procedure.</P>

            <P>11.5.3.1 Prepare the directional probe and differential pressure gauges as recommended by the manufacturer. Capillary tubing or surge tanks may be used to dampen pressure fluctuations. It is recommended, but not required, that a pretest leak check be conducted. To perform a leak check, pressurize or use suction on the impact opening until a reading of at least 7.6 cm (3 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>O registers on the differential pressure gauge, then plug the impact opening. The pressure of a leak-free system will remain stable for at least 15 seconds.</P>
            <P>11.5.3.2 Level and zero the manometers. Since the manometer level and zero may drift because of vibrations and temperature changes, periodically check the level and zero during the traverse.</P>
            <P>11.5.3.3 Position the probe at the appropriate locations in the gas stream, and rotate until zero deflection is indicated for the yaw angle pressure gauge. Determine and record the yaw angle. Record the pressure gauge readings for the pitch angle, and determine the pitch angle from the calibration curve. Repeat this procedure for each traverse point. Complete a “back-purge” of the pressure lines and the impact openings prior to measurements of each traverse point.</P>
            <P>11.5.3.4 A post-test check as described in section 11.5.3.1 is required. If the criteria for a leak-free system are not met, repair the equipment, and repeat the flow angle measurements.</P>
            <P>11.5.4 Calibration. Use a flow system as described in sections 10.1.2.1 and 10.1.2.2 of Method 2. In addition, the flow system shall have the capacity to generate two test-section velocities: one between 365 and 730 m/min (1,200 and 2,400 ft/min) and one between 730 and 1,100 m/min (2,400 and 3,600 ft/min).</P>
            <P>11.5.4.1 Cut two entry ports in the test section. The axes through the entry ports shall be perpendicular to each other and intersect in the centroid of the test section. The ports should be elongated slots parallel to the axis of the test section and of sufficient length to allow measurement of pitch angles while maintaining the pitot head position at the test-section centroid. To facilitate alignment of the directional probe during calibration, the test section should be constructed of plexiglass or some other transparent material. All calibration measurements should be made at the same point in the test section, preferably at the centroid of the test section.</P>
            <P>11.5.4.2 To ensure that the gas flow is parallel to the central axis of the test section, follow the procedure outlined in section 11.4 for cyclonic flow determination to measure the gas flow angles at the centroid of the test section from two test ports located 90° apart. The gas flow angle measured in each port must be ±2° of 0°. Straightening vanes should be installed, if necessary, to meet this criterion.</P>
            <P>11.5.4.3 Pitch Angle Calibration. Perform a calibration traverse according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol in 5° increments for angles from −60° to + 60° at one velocity in each of the two ranges specified above. Average the pressure ratio values obtained for each angle in the two flow ranges, and plot a calibration curve with the average values of the pressure ratio (or other suitable measurement factor as recommended by the manufacturer) versus the pitch angle. Draw a smooth line through the data points. Plot also the data values for each traverse point. Determine the differences between the measured data values and the angle from the calibration curve at the same pressure ratio. The difference at each comparison must be within 2° for angles between 0° and 40° and within 3° for angles between 40° and 60°.</P>
            <P>11.5.4.4 Yaw Angle Calibration. Mark the three-dimensional probe to allow the determination of the yaw position of the probe. This is usually a line extending the length of the probe and aligned with the impact opening. To determine the accuracy of measurements of the yaw angle, only the zero or null position need be calibrated as follows: Place the directional probe in the test section, and rotate the probe until the zero position is found. With a protractor or other angle measuring device, measure the angle indicated by the yaw angle indicator on the three-dimensional probe. This should be within 2° of 0°. Repeat this measurement for any other points along the length of the pitot where yaw angle measurements could be read in order to account for variations in the pitot markings used to indicate pitot head positions.</P>

              <P>This method does not include all of the specifications (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> equipment and supplies) and procedures (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sampling) essential to its performance.

Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test method: Method 1.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <P>1.1 Measured Parameters. The purpose of the method is to provide guidance for the selection of sampling ports and traverse points at which sampling for air pollutants will be performed pursuant to regulations set forth in this part.</P>
            <P>1.2 Applicability. The applicability and principle of this method are identical to Method 1, except its applicability is limited to stacks or ducts. This method is applicable to flowing gas streams in ducts, stacks, and flues of less than about 0.30 meter (12 in.) in diameter, or 0.071 m<SU>2</SU> (113 in.<SU>2</SU>) in cross-sectional area, but equal to or greater than about 0.10 meter (4 in.) in diameter, or 0.0081 m<SU>2</SU> (12.57 in.<SU>2</SU>) in cross-sectional area. This method cannot be used when the flow is cyclonic or swirling.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>2.1 The method is designed to aid in the representative measurement of pollutant emissions and/or total volumetric flow rate from a stationary source. A measurement site or a pair of measurement sites where the effluent stream is flowing in a known direction is (are) selected. The cross-section of the stack is divided into a number of equal areas. Traverse points are then located within each of these equal areas.</P>

            <P>2.2 In these small diameter stacks or ducts, the conventional Method 5 stack assembly (consisting of a Type S pitot tube attached to a sampling probe, equipped with a nozzle and thermocouple) blocks a significant portion of the cross-section of the duct and causes inaccurate measurements. Therefore, for particulate matter (PM) sampling in small stacks or ducts, the gas velocity is measured using a standard pitot tube downstream of the actual emission sampling site. <PRTPAGE P="13"/>The straight run of duct between the PM sampling and velocity measurement sites allows the flow profile, temporarily disturbed by the presence of the sampling probe, to redevelop and stabilize.</P>

            <P>11.1 Selection of Measurement Site.</P>
            <P>11.1.1 Particulate Measurements—Steady or Unsteady Flow. Select a particulate measurement site located preferably at least eight equivalent stack or duct diameters downstream and 10 equivalent diameters upstream from any flow disturbances such as bends, expansions, or contractions in the stack, or from a visible flame. Next, locate the velocity measurement site eight equivalent diameters downstream of the particulate measurement site (see Figure 1A-1). If such locations are not available, select an alternative particulate measurement location at least two equivalent stack or duct diameters downstream and two and one-half diameters upstream from any flow disturbance. Then, locate the velocity measurement site two equivalent diameters downstream from the particulate measurement site. (See section 12.2 of Method 1 for calculating equivalent diameters for a rectangular cross-section.)</P>
            <P>11.1.2 PM Sampling (Steady Flow) or Velocity (Steady or Unsteady Flow) Measurements. For PM sampling when the volumetric flow rate in a duct is constant with respect to time, section 11.1.1 of Method 1 may be followed, with the PM sampling and velocity measurement performed at one location. To demonstrate that the flow rate is constant (within 10 percent) when PM measurements are made, perform complete velocity traverses before and after the PM sampling run, and calculate the deviation of the flow rate derived after the PM sampling run from the one derived before the PM sampling run. The PM sampling run is acceptable if the deviation does not exceed 10 percent.</P>
            <P>11.2 Determining the Number of Traverse Points.</P>
            <P>11.2.1 Particulate Measurements (Steady or Unsteady Flow). Use Figure 1-1 of Method 1 to determine the number of traverse points to use at both the velocity measurement and PM sampling locations. Before referring to the figure, however, determine the distances between both the velocity measurement and PM sampling sites to the nearest upstream and downstream disturbances. Then divide each distance by the stack diameter or equivalent diameter to express the distances in terms of the number of duct diameters. Then, determine the number of traverse points from Figure 1-1 of Method 1 corresponding to each of these four distances. Choose the highest of the four numbers of traverse points (or a greater number) so that, for circular ducts the number is a multiple of four; and for rectangular ducts, the number is one of those shown in Table 1-1 of Method 1. When the optimum duct diameter location criteria can be satisfied, the minimum number of traverse points required is eight for circular ducts and nine for rectangular ducts.</P>
            <P>11.2.2 PM Sampling (Steady Flow) or only Velocity (Non-Particulate) Measurements. Use Figure 1-2 of Method 1 to determine number of traverse points, following the same procedure used for PM sampling as described in section 11.2.1 of Method 1. When the optimum duct diameter location criteria can be satisfied, the minimum number of traverse points required is eight for circular ducts and nine for rectangular ducts.</P>
            <P>11.3 Cross-sectional Layout, Location of Traverse Points, and Verification of the Absence of Cyclonic Flow. Same as Method 1, sections 11.3 and 11.4, respectively.</P>

            <P>1.1 This method is applicable for the determination of the average velocity and the volumetric flow rate of a gas stream.</P>
            <P>1.2 This method is not applicable at measurement sites that fail to meet the criteria of Method 1, section 11.1. Also, the method cannot be used for direct measurement in cyclonic or swirling gas streams; section 11.4 of Method 1 shows how to determine cyclonic or swirling flow conditions. When unacceptable conditions exist, alternative procedures, subject to the approval of the Administrator, must be employed to produce accurate flow rate determinations. Examples of such alternative procedures are: (1) to install straightening vanes; (2) to calculate the total volumetric flow rate stoichiometrically, or (3) to move to another measurement site at which the flow is acceptable.</P>

            <P>Specifications for the apparatus are given below. Any other apparatus that has been demonstrated (subject to approval of the Administrator) to be capable of meeting the specifications will be considered acceptable.</P>
            <P>6.1 Type S Pitot Tube.</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Pitot tube made of metal tubing (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, stainless steel) as shown in Figure 2-1. It is recommended that the external tubing diameter (dimension D<E T="52">t</E>, Figure 2-2b) be between 0.48 and 0.95 cm (<FR>3/16</FR> and <FR>3/8</FR> inch). There shall be an equal distance from the base of each leg of the pitot tube to its face-opening plane (dimensions P<E T="52">A</E> and P<E T="52">B</E>, Figure 2-2b); it is recommended that this distance be between 1.05 and 1.50 times the external tubing diameter. The face openings of the pitot tube shall, preferably, be aligned as shown in Figure 2-2; however, slight misalignments of the openings are permissible (see Figure 2-3).</P>

            <P>6.1.2 The Type S pitot tube shall have a known coefficient, determined as outlined in section 10.0. An identification number shall be assigned to the pitot tube; this number shall be permanently marked or engraved on <PRTPAGE P="15"/>the body of the tube. A standard pitot tube may be used instead of a Type S, provided that it meets the specifications of sections 6.7 and 10.2. Note, however, that the static and impact pressure holes of standard pitot tubes are susceptible to plugging in particulate-laden gas streams. Therefore, whenever a standard pitot tube is used to perform a traverse, adequate proof must be furnished that the openings of the pitot tube have not plugged up during the traverse period. This can be accomplished by comparing the velocity head (Δp) measurement recorded at a selected traverse point (readable Δp value) with a second Δp measurement recorded after “back purging” with pressurized air to clean the impact and static holes of the standard pitot tube. If the before and after Δp measurements are within 5 percent, then the traverse data are acceptable. Otherwise, the data should be rejected and the traverse measurements redone. Note that the selected traverse point should be one that demonstrates a readable Δp value. If “back purging” at regular intervals is part of a routine procedure, then comparative Δp measurements shall be conducted as above for the last two traverse points that exhibit suitable Δp measurements.</P>

            <P>6.2 Differential Pressure Gauge. An inclined manometer or equivalent device. Most sampling trains are equipped with a 10 in. (water column) inclined-vertical manometer, having 0.01 in. H<E T="52">2</E>0 divisions on the 0 to 1 in. inclined scale, and 0.1 in. H<E T="52">2</E>0 divisions on the 1 to 10 in. vertical scale. This type of manometer (or other gauge of equivalent sensitivity) is satisfactory for the measurement of Δp values as low as 1.27 mm (0.05 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0. However, a differential pressure gauge of greater sensitivity shall be used (subject to the approval of the Administrator), if any of the following is found to be true: (1) the arithmetic average of all Δp readings at the traverse points in the stack is less than 1.27 mm (0.05 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0; (2) for traverses of 12 or more points, more than 10 percent of the individual Δp readings are below 1.27 mm (0.05 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0; or (3) for traverses of fewer than 12 points, more than one Δp reading is below 1.27 mm (0.05 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0. Reference 18 (see section 17.0) describes commercially available instrumentation for the measurement of low-range gas velocities.</P>

            <P>6.2.1 As an alternative to criteria (1) through (3) above, Equation 2-1 (Section 12.2) may be used to determine the necessity of using a more sensitive differential pressure gauge. If T is greater than 1.05, the velocity head data are unacceptable and a more sensitive differential pressure gauge must be used.

              <P>If differential pressure gauges other than inclined manometers are used (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, magnehelic gauges), their calibration must be checked after each test series. To check the calibration of a differential pressure gauge, compare Δp readings of the gauge with those of a gauge-oil manometer at a minimum of three points, approximately representing the range of Δp values in the stack. If, at each point, the values of Δp as read by the differential pressure gauge and gauge-oil manometer agree to within 5 percent, the differential pressure gauge shall be considered to be in proper calibration. Otherwise, the test series shall either be voided, or procedures to adjust the measured Δp values and final results shall be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

A thermocouple, liquid-filled bulb thermometer, bimetallic thermometer, mercury-in-glass thermometer, or other gauge capable of measuring temperatures to within 1.5 percent of the minimum absolute stack temperature. The temperature sensor shall be attached to the pitot tube such that the sensor tip does not touch any metal; the gauge shall be in an interference-free arrangement with respect to the pitot tube face openings (see Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-4). Alternative positions may be used if the pitot tube-temperature gauge system is calibrated according to the procedure of section 10.0. Provided that a difference of not more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is introduced, the temperature gauge need not be attached to the pitot tube. This alternative is subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

            <P>6.7 Calibration Pitot Tube. Calibration of the Type S pitot tube requires a standard pitot tube for a reference. When calibration of the Type S pitot tube is necessary (see Section 10.1), a standard pitot tube shall be used for a reference. The standard pitot tube shall, preferably, have a known coefficient, obtained directly from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD 20899, (301) 975-2002; or by calibration against another standard pitot tube with a NIST-traceable coefficient. Alternatively, a standard pitot tube designed according to the criteria given in sections 6.7.1 through 6.7.5 below and illustrated in Figure 2-5 (see also References 7, 8, and 17 in section 17.0) may be used. Pitot tubes designed according to these specifications will have baseline coefficients of 0.99 ±0.01.</P>

If the single-velocity calibration technique is employed (see section 10.1.2.3), the calibration differential pressure gauge shall be readable to the nearest 0.127 mm (0.005 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0. For multivelocity calibrations, the gauge shall be readable to the nearest 0.127 mm (0.005 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0 for Δp values between 1.27 and 25.4 mm (0.05 and 1.00 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0, and to the nearest 1.27 mm (0.05 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0 for Δp values above 25.4 mm (1.00 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0. A special, more sensitive gauge will be required to read Δp values below 1.27 mm (0.05 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>0 (see Reference 18 in section 16.0).</P>

            <P>8.1 Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2-1. Capillary tubing or surge tanks installed between the manometer and pitot tube may be used to dampen ΔP fluctuations. It is recommended, but not required, that a pretest leak-check be conducted as follows: (1) blow through the pitot impact opening until at least 7.6 cm (3.0 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>O velocity head registers on the manometer; then, close off the impact opening. The pressure shall remain stable (±2.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O, ±0.10 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) for at least 15 seconds; (2) do the same for the static pressure side, except using suction to obtain the minimum of 7.6 cm (3.0 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>O. Other leak-check procedures, subject to the approval of the Administrator, may be used.</P>
            <P>8.2 Level and zero the manometer. Because the manometer level and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature changes, make periodic checks during the traverse (at least once per hour). Record all necessary data on a form similar to that shown in Figure 2-6.</P>
            <P>8.3 Measure the velocity head and temperature at the traverse points specified by Method 1. Ensure that the proper differential pressure gauge is being used for the range of Δp values encountered (see section 6.2). If it is necessary to change to a more sensitive gauge, do so, and remeasure the Δp and temperature readings at each traverse point. Conduct a post-test leak-check (mandatory), as described in section 8.1 above, to validate the traverse run.</P>
            <P>8.4 Measure the static pressure in the stack. One reading is usually adequate.</P>
            <P>8.5 Determine the atmospheric pressure.</P>

            <P>8.6 Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight. For combustion processes or processes that emit essentially CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, CO, and N<E T="52">2</E>, use Method 3. For processes emitting essentially air, an analysis need not be conducted; use a dry molecular weight of 29.0. For other processes, other methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, must be used.</P>
            <P>8.7 Obtain the moisture content from Method 4 (reference method, or equivalent) or from Method 5.</P>
            <P>8.8 Determine the cross-sectional area of the stack or duct at the sampling location. Whenever possible, physically measure the stack dimensions rather than using blueprints. Do not assume that stack diameters are equal. Measure each diameter distance to verify its dimensions.</P>

            <P>10.1 Type S Pitot Tube. Before its initial use, carefully examine the Type S pitot tube top, side, and end views to verify that the face openings of the tube are aligned within the specifications illustrated in Figures 2-2 <PRTPAGE P="17"/>and 2-3. The pitot tube shall not be used if it fails to meet these alignment specifications. After verifying the face opening alignment, measure and record the following dimensions of the pitot tube: (a) the external tubing diameter (dimension D<E T="52">t</E>, Figure 2-2b); and (b) the base-to-opening plane distances (dimensions P<E T="52">A</E> and P<E T="52">B</E>, Figure 2-2b). If D<E T="52">t</E> is between 0.48 and 0.95 cm <FR>3/16</FR> and <FR>3/8</FR> in.), and if P<E T="52">A</E> and P<E T="52">B</E> are equal and between 1.05 and 1.50 D<E T="52">t</E>, there are two possible options: (1) the pitot tube may be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in sections 10.1.2 through 10.1.5, or (2) a baseline (isolated tube) coefficient value of 0.84 may be assigned to the pitot tube. Note, however, that if the pitot tube is part of an assembly, calibration may still be required, despite knowledge of the baseline coefficient value (see section 10.1.1). If D<E T="52">t</E>, P<E T="52">A</E>, and P<E T="52">B</E> are outside the specified limits, the pitot tube must be calibrated as outlined in sections 10.1.2 through 10.1.5.</P>

            <P>10.1.1 Type S Pitot Tube Assemblies. During sample and velocity traverses, the isolated Type S pitot tube is not always used; in many instances, the pitot tube is used in combination with other source-sampling components (e.g., thermocouple, sampling probe, nozzle) as part of an “assembly.” The presence of other sampling components can sometimes affect the baseline value of the Type S pitot tube coefficient (Reference 9 in section 17.0); therefore, an assigned (or otherwise known) baseline coefficient value may or may not be valid for a given assembly. The baseline and assembly coefficient values will be identical only when the relative placement of the components in the assembly is such that aerodynamic interference effects are eliminated. Figures 2-4, 2-7, and 2-8 illustrate interference-free component arrangements for Type S pitot tubes having external tubing diameters between 0.48 and 0.95 cm (<FR>3/16</FR> and <FR>3/8</FR> in.). Type S pitot tube assemblies that fail to meet any or all of the specifications of Figures 2-4, 2-7, and 2-8 shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in sections 10.1.2 through 10.1.5, and prior to calibration, the values of the intercomponent spacings (pitot-nozzle, pitot-thermocouple, pitot-probe sheath) shall be measured and recorded.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Do not use a Type S pitot tube assembly that is constructed such that the impact pressure opening plane of the pitot tube is below the entry plane of the nozzle (see Figure 2-7B).</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>10.1.2 Calibration Setup. If the Type S pitot tube is to be calibrated, one leg of the tube shall be permanently marked A, and the other, B. Calibration shall be performed in a flow system having the following essential design features:</P>
            <P>10.1.2.1 The flowing gas stream must be confined to a duct of definite cross-sectional area, either circular or rectangular. For circular cross sections, the minimum duct diameter shall be 30.48 cm (12 in.); for rectangular cross sections, the width (shorter side) shall be at least 25.4 cm (10 in.).</P>

            <P>10.1.2.2 The cross-sectional area of the calibration duct must be constant over a distance of 10 or more duct diameters. For a rectangular cross section, use an equivalent diameter, calculated according to Equation 2-2 (see section 12.3), to determine the number of duct diameters. To ensure the presence of stable, fully developed flow patterns at the calibration site, or “test section,” the site must be located at least eight diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from the nearest disturbances.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The eight- and two-diameter criteria are not absolute; other test section locations may be used (subject to approval of the Administrator), provided that the flow at the test site has been demonstrated to be or found stable and parallel to the duct axis.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>10.1.2.3 The flow system shall have the capacity to generate a test-section velocity around 910 m/min (3,000 ft/min). This velocity must be constant with time to guarantee constant and steady flow during the entire period of calibration. A centrifugal fan is recommended for this purpose, as no flow rate adjustment for back pressure of the fan is allowed during the calibration process. Note that Type S pitot tube coefficients obtained by single-velocity calibration at 910 m/min (3,000 ft/min) will generally be valid to ±3 percent for the measurement of velocities above 300 m/min (1,000 ft/min) and to ±6 percent for the measurement of velocities between 180 and 300 m/min (600 and 1,000 ft/min). If a more precise correlation between the pitot tube coefficient (Cp) and velocity is desired, the flow system should have the capacity to generate at least four distinct, time-invariant test-section velocities covering the velocity range from 180 to 1,500 m/min (600 to 5,000 ft/min), and calibration data shall be taken at regular velocity intervals over this range (see References 9 and 14 in section 17.0 for details).</P>
            <P>10.1.2.4 Two entry ports, one for each of the standard and Type S pitot tubes, shall be cut in the test section. The standard pitot entry port shall be located slightly downstream of the Type S port, so that the standard and Type S impact openings will lie in the same cross-sectional plane during calibration. To facilitate alignment of the pitot tubes during calibration, it is advisable that the test section be constructed of Plexiglas <SU>TM</SU> or some other transparent material.</P>

            <P>10.1.3 Calibration Procedure. Note that this procedure is a general one and must not be used without first referring to the special considerations presented in section 10.1.5. Note also that this procedure applies only to <PRTPAGE P="18"/>single-velocity calibration. To obtain calibration data for the A and B sides of the Type S pitot tube, proceed as follows:</P>
            <P>10.1.3.1 Make sure that the manometer is properly filled and that the oil is free from contamination and is of the proper density. Inspect and leak-check all pitot lines; repair or replace if necessary.</P>
            <P>10.1.3.2 Level and zero the manometer. Switch on the fan, and allow the flow to stabilize. Seal the Type S pitot tube entry port.</P>
            <P>10.1.3.3 Ensure that the manometer is level and zeroed. Position the standard pitot tube at the calibration point (determined as outlined in section 10.1.5.1), and align the tube so that its tip is pointed directly into the flow. Particular care should be taken in aligning the tube to avoid yaw and pitch angles. Make sure that the entry port surrounding the tube is properly sealed.</P>
            <P>10.1.3.4 Read Δp<E T="52">std</E>, and record its value in a data table similar to the one shown in Figure 2-9. Remove the standard pitot tube from the duct, and disconnect it from the manometer. Seal the standard entry port. Make no adjustment to the fan speed or other wind tunnel volumetric flow control device between this reading and the corresponding Type S pitot reading.</P>
            <P>10.1.3.5 Connect the Type S pitot tube to the manometer and leak-check. Open the Type S tube entry port. Check the manometer level and zero. Insert and align the Type S pitot tube so that its A side impact opening is at the same point as was the standard pitot tube and is pointed directly into the flow. Make sure that the entry port surrounding the tube is properly sealed.</P>
            <P>10.1.3.6 Read Δp<E T="52">s</E>, and enter its value in the data table. Remove the Type S pitot tube from the duct, and disconnect it from the manometer.</P>
            <P>10.1.3.7 Repeat Steps 10.1.3.3 through 10.1.3.6 until three pairs of Δp readings have been obtained for the A side of the Type S pitot tube, with all the paired observations conducted at a constant fan speed (no changes to fan velocity between observed readings).</P>
            <P>10.1.3.8 Repeat Steps 10.1.3.3 through 10.1.3.7 for the B side of the Type S pitot tube.</P>

            <P>10.1.3.9 Perform calculations as described in section 12.4. Use the Type S pitot tube only if the values of σ<E T="52">A</E> and σ<E T="52">B</E> are less than or equal to 0.01 and if the absolute value of the difference between C<AC T="8"/>
              <E T="52">p(A)</E> and C<AC T="8"/>
              <E T="52">p(B)</E> is 0.01 or less.</P>
            <P>10.1.4 Special Considerations.</P>
            <P>10.1.4.1 Selection of Calibration Point.</P>

            <P>10.1.4.1.1 When an isolated Type S pitot tube is calibrated, select a calibration point at or near the center of the duct, and follow the procedures outlined in section 10.1.3. The Type S pitot coefficients measured or calculated, (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> C<AC T="8"/>
              <E T="52">p(A)</E> and C<AC T="8"/>
              <E T="52">p(B)</E>) will be valid, so long as either: (1) the isolated pitot tube is used; or (2) the pitot tube is used with other components (nozzle, thermocouple, sample probe) in an arrangement that is free from aerodynamic interference effects (see Figures 2-4, 2-7, and 2-8).</P>
            <P>10.1.4.1.2 For Type S pitot tube-thermocouple combinations (without probe assembly), select a calibration point at or near the center of the duct, and follow the procedures outlined in section 10.1.3. The coefficients so obtained will be valid so long as the pitot tube-thermocouple combination is used by itself or with other components in an interference-free arrangement (Figures 2-4, 2-7, and 2-8).</P>
            <P>10.1.4.1.3 For Type S pitot tube combinations with complete probe assemblies, the calibration point should be located at or near the center of the duct; however, insertion of a probe sheath into a small duct may cause significant cross-sectional area interference and blockage and yield incorrect coefficient values (Reference 9 in section 17.0). Therefore, to minimize the blockage effect, the calibration point may be a few inches off-center if necessary, but no closer to the outer wall of the wind tunnel than 4 inches. The maximum allowable blockage, as determined by a projected-area model of the probe sheath, is 2 percent or less of the duct cross-sectional area (Figure 2-10a). If the pitot and/or probe assembly blocks more than 2 percent of the cross-sectional area at an insertion point only 4 inches inside the wind tunnel, the diameter of the wind tunnel must be increased.</P>

            <P>10.1.4.2 For those probe assemblies in which pitot tube-nozzle interference is a factor (i.e., those in which the pitot-nozzle separation distance fails to meet the specifications illustrated in Figure 2-7A), the value of C<E T="52">p(s)</E> depends upon the amount of free space between the tube and nozzle and, therefore, is a function of nozzle size. In these instances, separate calibrations shall be performed with each of the commonly used nozzle sizes in place. Note that the single-velocity calibration technique is acceptable for this purpose, even though the larger nozzle sizes (&gt;0.635 cm or <FR>1/4</FR> in.) are not ordinarily used for isokinetic sampling at velocities around 910 m/min (3,000 ft/min), which is the calibration velocity. Note also that it is not necessary to draw an isokinetic sample during calibration (see Reference 19 in section 17.0).</P>
            <P>10.1.4.3 For a probe assembly constructed such that its pitot tube is always used in the same orientation, only one side of the pitot tube needs to be calibrated (the side which will face the flow). The pitot tube must still meet the alignment specifications of Figure 2-2 or 2-3, however, and must have an average deviation (σ) value of 0.01 or less (see section 12.4.4).</P>
            <P>10.1.5 Field Use and Recalibration.</P>
            <P>10.1.5.1 Field Use.</P>

            <P>10.1.5.1.1 When a Type S pitot tube (isolated or in an assembly) is used in the field, the appropriate coefficient value (whether <PRTPAGE P="19"/>assigned or obtained by calibration) shall be used to perform velocity calculations. For calibrated Type S pitot tubes, the A side coefficient shall be used when the A side of the tube faces the flow, and the B side coefficient shall be used when the B side faces the flow. Alternatively, the arithmetic average of the A and B side coefficient values may be used, irrespective of which side faces the flow.</P>

            <P>10.1.5.1.2 When a probe assembly is used to sample a small duct, 30.5 to 91.4 cm (12 to 36 in.) in diameter, the probe sheath sometimes blocks a significant part of the duct cross-section, causing a reduction in the effective value of C<E T="52">p(s)</E>. Consult Reference 9 (see section 17.0) for details. Conventional pitot-sampling probe assemblies are not recommended for use in ducts having inside diameters smaller than 30.5 cm (12 in.) (see Reference 16 in section 17.0).</P>
            <P>10.1.5.2 Recalibration.</P>
            <P>10.1.5.2.1 Isolated Pitot Tubes. After each field use, the pitot tube shall be carefully reexamined in top, side, and end views. If the pitot face openings are still aligned within the specifications illustrated in Figure 2-2 and Figure 2-3, it can be assumed that the baseline coefficient of the pitot tube has not changed. If, however, the tube has been damaged to the extent that it no longer meets the specifications of Figure 2-2 and Figure 2-3, the damage shall either be repaired to restore proper alignment of the face openings, or the tube shall be discarded.</P>
            <P>10.1.5.2.2 Pitot Tube Assemblies. After each field use, check the face opening alignment of the pitot tube, as in section 10.1.5.2.1. Also, remeasure the intercomponent spacings of the assembly. If the intercomponent spacings have not changed and the face opening alignment is acceptable, it can be assumed that the coefficient of the assembly has not changed. If the face opening alignment is no longer within the specifications of Figure 2-2 and Figure 2-3, either repair the damage or replace the pitot tube (calibrating the new assembly, if necessary). If the intercomponent spacings have changed, restore the original spacings, or recalibrate the assembly.</P>
            <P>10.2 Standard Pitot Tube (if applicable). If a standard pitot tube is used for the velocity traverse, the tube shall be constructed according to the criteria of section 6.7 and shall be assigned a baseline coefficient value of 0.99. If the standard pitot tube is used as part of an assembly, the tube shall be in an interference-free arrangement (subject to the approval of the Administrator).</P>
            <P>10.3 Temperature Sensors.</P>

            <P>10.3.1 After each field use, calibrate dial thermometers, liquid-filled bulb thermometers, thermocouple-potentiometer systems, and other sensors at a temperature within 10 percent of the average absolute stack temperature. For temperatures up to 405 °C (761 °F), use an ASTM mercury-in-glass reference thermometer, or equivalent, as a reference. Alternatively, either a reference thermocouple and potentiometer (calibrated against NIST standards) or thermometric fixed points (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ice bath and boiling water, corrected for barometric pressure) may be used. For temperatures above 405 °C (761 °F), use a reference thermocouple-potentiometer system calibrated against NIST standards or an alternative reference, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>10.3.2 The temperature data recorded in the field shall be considered valid. If, during calibration, the absolute temperature measured with the sensor being calibrated and the reference sensor agree within 1.5 percent, the temperature data taken in the field shall be considered valid. Otherwise, the pollutant emission test shall either be considered invalid or adjustments (if appropriate) of the test results shall be made, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>10.4 Barometer. Calibrate the barometer used against a mercury barometer or NIST-traceable barometer prior to each field test.</P>

            <P>6.1 Gas Volume Meter. A positive displacement meter, turbine meter, or other direct measuring device capable of measuring volume to within 2 percent. The meter shall be equipped with a temperature sensor (accurate to within ±2 percent of the minimum absolute temperature) and a pressure gauge (accurate to within ±2.5 mm Hg).

            <P>8.1 Installation. As there are numerous types of pipes and small ducts that may be subject to volume measurement, it would be difficult to describe all possible installation schemes. In general, flange fittings should be used for all connections wherever possible. Gaskets or other seal materials should be used to assure leak-tight connections. The volume meter should be located so as to avoid severe vibrations and other factors that may affect the meter calibration.</P>
            <P>8.2 Leak Test.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 A volume meter installed at a location under positive pressure may be leak-checked at the meter connections by using a liquid leak detector solution containing a surfactant. Apply a small amount of the solution to the connections. If a leak exists, bubbles will form, and the leak must be corrected.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 A volume meter installed at a location under negative pressure is very difficult to test for leaks without blocking flow at the inlet of the line and watching for meter movement. If this procedure is not possible, visually check all connections to assure leak-tight seals.</P>
            <P>8.3 Volume Measurement.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 For sources with continuous, steady emission flow rates, record the initial meter volume reading, meter temperature(s), meter pressure, and start the stopwatch. Throughout the test period, record the meter temperatures and pressures so that average values can be determined. At the end of the test, stop the timer, and record the elapsed time, the final volume reading, meter temperature, and pressure. Record the barometric pressure at the beginning and end of the test run. Record the data on a table similar to that shown in Figure 2A-1.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 For sources with noncontinuous, non-steady emission flow rates, use the procedure in section 8.3.1 with the addition of the following: Record all the meter parameters and the start and stop times corresponding to each process cyclical or noncontinuous event.</P>

            <P>10.1 Volume Meter.</P>
            <P>10.1.1 The volume meter is calibrated against a standard reference meter prior to its initial use in the field. The reference meter is a spirometer or liquid displacement meter with a capacity consistent with that of the test meter.</P>
            <P>10.1.2 Alternatively, a calibrated, standard pitot may be used as the reference meter in conjunction with a wind tunnel assembly. Attach the test meter to the wind tunnel so that the total flow passes through the test meter. For each calibration run, conduct a 4-point traverse along one stack diameter at a position at least eight diameters of straight tunnel downstream and two diameters upstream of any bend, inlet, or air mover. Determine the traverse point locations as specified in Method 1. Calculate the reference volume using the velocity values following the procedure in Method 2, the wind tunnel cross-sectional area, and the run time.</P>

            <P>10.1.3 Set up the test meter in a configuration similar to that used in the field installation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> in relation to the flow moving device). Connect the temperature sensor and pressure gauge as they are to be used in the field. Connect the reference meter at the inlet of the flow line, if appropriate for the meter, and begin gas flow through the system to condition the meters. During this conditioning operation, check the system for leaks.</P>
            <P>10.1.4 The calibration shall be performed during at least three different flow rates. The calibration flow rates shall be about 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 times the rated maximum flow rate of the test meter.</P>
            <P>10.1.5 For each calibration run, the data to be collected include: reference meter initial and final volume readings, the test meter initial and final volume reading, meter average temperature and pressure, barometric pressure, and run time. Repeat the runs at each flow rate at least three times.</P>
            <P>10.1.6 Calculate the test meter calibration coefficient as indicated in section 12.2.</P>
            <P>10.1.7 Compare the three Y<E T="52">m</E> values at each of the flow rates tested and determine the maximum and minimum values. The difference between the maximum and minimum values at each flow rate should be no greater than 0.030. Extra runs may be required to complete this requirement. If this specification cannot be met in six successive runs, the test meter is not suitable for use. In addition, the meter coefficients should be between 0.95 and 1.05. If these specifications are met at all the flow rates, average all the Y<E T="52">m</E> values from runs meeting the specifications to obtain an average meter calibration coefficient, Y<E T="52">m</E>.</P>

            <P>10.1.8 The procedure above shall be performed at least once for each volume meter. Thereafter, an abbreviated calibration check shall be completed following each field test. The calibration of the volume meter shall be checked with the meter pressure set at the average value encountered during the field test. Three calibration checks (runs) shall be performed using this average flow rate value. Calculate the average value of the calibration factor. If the calibration has changed by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the meter over the full range of flow as described above.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

              <P>If the volume meter calibration coefficient values obtained before and after a test series differ by more than 5 percent, the test series shall either be voided, or calculations for the test series shall be performed using whichever meter coefficient value (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> before or after) gives the greater value of pollutant emission rate.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>10.2 Temperature Sensor. After each test series, check the temperature sensor at ambient temperature. Use an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) mercury-in-glass reference thermometer, or equivalent, as a reference. If the sensor being checked agrees within 2 percent (absolute temperature) of the reference, the temperature data collected in the field shall be considered valid. Otherwise, the test data shall be considered invalid or adjustments of the results shall be made, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>10.3 Barometer. Calibrate the barometer used against a mercury barometer or NIST-traceable barometer prior to the field test.</P>

            <P>8.1 Follow the general procedures in section 8.0 of Method 2, except conduct the measurements at the traverse points specified in Method 1A. The static and impact pressure holes of standard pitot tubes are susceptible to plugging in particulate-laden gas streams. Therefore, adequate proof that the openings of the pitot tube have not <PRTPAGE P="34"/>plugged during the traverse period must be furnished; this can be done by taking the velocity head (Δp) heading at the final traverse point, cleaning out the impact and static holes of the standard pitot tube by “back-purging” with pressurized air, and then taking another Δp reading. If the Δp readings made before and after the air purge are the same (within ±5 percent) the traverse is acceptable. Otherwise, reject the run. Note that if the Δp at the final traverse point is unsuitably low, another point may be selected. If “back purging” at regular intervals is part of the procedure, then take comparative Δp readings, as above, for the last two back purges at which suitably high Δp readings are observed.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

              <P>This method does not include all of the specifications (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, equipment and supplies) and procedures (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this <PRTPAGE P="37"/>method should also have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Methods 2 and 3C.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <P>1.1 Applicability. This method applies to the measurement of landfill gas (LFG) production flow rate from municipal solid waste landfills and is used to calculate the flow rate of nonmethane organic compounds (NMOC) from landfills.</P>
            <P>1.2 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>2.1 Extraction wells are installed either in a cluster of three or at five dispersed locations in the landfill. A blower is used to extract LFG from the landfill. LFG composition, landfill pressures, and orifice pressure differentials from the wells are measured and the landfill gas production flow rate is calculated.</P>

            </HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 Safety</HD>
            <P>5.1 Since this method is complex, only experienced personnel should perform the test. Landfill gas contains methane, therefore explosive mixtures may exist at or near the landfill.

            <P>8.1 Placement of Extraction Wells. The landfill owner or operator may install a single cluster of three extraction wells in a test area or space five equal-volume wells over the landfill. The cluster wells are recommended but may be used only if the composition, age of the refuse, and the landfill depth of the test area can be determined.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Cluster Wells. Consult landfill site records for the age of the refuse, depth, and composition of various sections of the landfill. Select an area near the perimeter of the landfill with a depth equal to or greater than the average depth of the landfill and with the average age of the refuse between 2 and 10 years old. Avoid areas known to contain nondecomposable materials, such as concrete and asbestos. Locate the cluster wells as shown in Figure 2E-2.</P>
            <P>8.1.1.1 The age of the refuse in a test area will not be uniform, so calculate a weighted average age of the refuse as shown in section 12.2.</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Equal Volume Wells. Divide the sections of the landfill that are at least 2 years old into five areas representing equal volumes. Locate an extraction well near the center of each area.<PRTPAGE P="38"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.2 Installation of Extraction Wells. Use a well drilling rig to dig a 0.6 m (24 in.) diameter hole in the landfill to a minimum of 75 percent of the landfill depth, not to extend to the bottom of the landfill or the liquid level. Perforate the bottom two thirds of the extraction well pipe. A minimum requirement for perforations is holes or slots with an open area equivalent to 0.01-m (0.5-in.) diameter holes spaced 90° apart every 0.1 to 0.2 m (4 to 8 in.). Place the extraction well in the center of the hole and backfill with gravel to a level 0.30 m (1 ft) above the perforated section. Add a layer of backfill material 1.2 m (4 ft) thick. Add a layer of bentonite 0.9 m (3 ft) thick, and backfill the remainder of the hole with cover material or material equal in permeability to the existing cover material. The specifications for extraction well installation are shown in Figure 2E-3.</P>
            <P>8.3 Pressure Probes. Shallow pressure probes are used in the check for infiltration of air into the landfill, and deep pressure probes are use to determine the radius of influence. Locate pressure probes along three radial arms approximately 120° apart at distances of 3, 15, 30, and 45 m (10, 50, 100, and 150 ft) from the extraction well. The tester has the option of locating additional pressure probes at distances every 15 m (50 feet) beyond 45 m (150 ft). Example placements of probes are shown in Figure 2E-4. The 15-, 30-, and 45-m, (50-, 100-, and 150-ft) probes from each well, and any additional probes located along the three radial arms (deep probes), shall extend to a depth equal to the top of the perforated section of the extraction wells. All other probes (shallow probes) shall extend to a depth equal to half the depth of the deep probes.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Use an auger to dig a hole, 0.15- to 0.23-m (6-to 9-in.) in diameter, for each pressure probe. Perforate the bottom two thirds of the pressure probe. A minimum requirement for perforations is holes or slots with an open area equivalent to four 0.006-m (0.25-in.) diameter holes spaced 90° apart every 0.15 m (6 in.). Place the pressure probe in the center of the hole and backfill with gravel to a level 0.30 m (1 ft) above the perforated section. Add a layer of backfill material at least 1.2 m (4 ft) thick. Add a layer of bentonite at least 0.3 m (1 ft) thick, and backfill the remainder of the hole with cover material or material equal in permeability to the existing cover material. The specifications for pressure probe installation are shown in Figure 2E-5.</P>
            <P>8.4 LFG Flow Rate Measurement. Place the flow measurement device, such as an orifice meter, as shown in Figure 2E-1. Attach the wells to the blower and flare assembly. The individual wells may be ducted to a common header so that a single blower, flare assembly, and flow meter may be used. Use the procedures in section 10.1 to calibrate the flow meter.</P>

            <P>8.5 Leak-Check. A leak-check of the above ground system is required for accurate flow rate measurements and for safety. Sample LFG at the well head sample port and at the outlet sample port. Use Method 3C to determine nitrogen (N<E T="52">2</E>) concentrations. Determine the difference between the well head and outlet N<E T="52">2</E> concentrations using the formula in section 12.3. The system passes the leak-check if the difference is less than 10,000 ppmv.</P>

            <P>8.6 Static Testing. Close the control valves on the well heads during static testing. Measure the gauge pressure (P<E T="52">g</E>) at each deep pressure probe and the barometric pressure (P<E T="52">bar</E>) every 8 hours (hr) for 3 days. Convert the gauge pressure of each deep pressure probe to absolute pressure using the equation in section 12.4. Record as P<E T="52">i</E> (initial absolute pressure).</P>

            <P>8.6.1 For each probe, average all of the 8-hr deep pressure probe readings (P<E T="52">i</E>) and record as P<E T="52">ia</E> (average absolute pressure). P<E T="52">ia</E> is used in section 8.7.5 to determine the maximum radius of influence.</P>
            <P>8.6.2 Measure the static flow rate of each well once during static testing.</P>
            <P>8.7 Short-Term Testing. The purpose of short-term testing is to determine the maximum vacuum that can be applied to the wells without infiltration of ambient air into the landfill. The short-term testing is performed on one well at a time. Burn all LFG with a flare or incinerator.</P>
            <P>8.7.1 Use the blower to extract LFG from a single well at a rate at least twice the static flow rate of the respective well measured in section 8.6.2. If using a single blower and flare assembly and a common header system, close the control valve on the wells not being measured. Allow 24 hr for the system to stabilize at this flow rate.</P>

            <P>8.7.2 Test for infiltration of air into the landfill by measuring the gauge pressures of the shallow pressure probes and using Method 3C to determine the LFG N<E T="52">2</E> concentration. If the LFG N<E T="52">2</E> concentration is less than 5 percent and all of the shallow probes have a positive gauge pressure, increase the blower vacuum by 3.7 mm Hg (2 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), wait 24 hr, and repeat the tests for infiltration. Continue the above steps of increasing blower vacuum by 3.7 mm Hg (2 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), waiting 24 hr, and testing for infiltration until the concentration of N<E T="52">2</E> exceeds 5 percent or any of the shallow probes have a negative gauge pressure. When this occurs,reduce the blower vacuum to the maximum setting at which the N<E T="52">2</E> concentration was less than 5 percent and the gauge pressures of the shallow probes are positive.</P>

            <P>8.7.3 At this blower vacuum, measure atmospheric pressure (P<E T="52">bar</E>) every 8 hr for 24 hr, and record the LFG flow rate (Q<E T="52">s</E>) and the probe gauge pressures (P<E T="52">f</E>) for all of the probes. Convert the gauge pressures of the <PRTPAGE P="39"/>deep probes to absolute pressures for each 8-hr reading at Q<E T="52">s</E> as shown in section 12.4.</P>

            <P>8.7.4 For each probe, average the 8-hr deep pressure probe absolute pressure readings and record as P<E T="52">fa</E> (the final average absolute pressure).</P>

            <P>8.7.5 For each probe, compare the initial average pressure (P<E T="52">ia</E>) from section 8.6.1 to the final average pressure (P<E T="52">fa</E>). Determine the furthermost point from the well head along each radial arm where P<E T="52">fa</E> ≤P<E T="52">ia</E>. This distance is the maximum radius of influence (R<E T="52">m</E>), which is the distance from the well affected by the vacuum. Average these values to determine the average maximum radius of influence (R<E T="52">ma</E>).</P>
            <P>8.7.6 Calculate the depth (D<E T="52">st</E>) affected by the extraction well during the short term test as shown in section 12.6. If the computed value of D<E T="52">st</E> exceeds the depth of the landfill, set D<E T="52">st</E> equal to the landfill depth.</P>
            <P>8.7.7 Calculate the void volume (V) for the extraction well as shown in section 12.7.</P>
            <P>8.7.8 Repeat the procedures in section 8.7 for each well.</P>

            <P>8.8 Calculate the total void volume of the test wells (V<E T="52">v</E>) by summing the void volumes (V) of each well.</P>

            <P>8.9 Long-Term Testing. The purpose of long-term testing is to extract two void volumes of LFG from the extraction wells. Use the blower to extract LFG from the wells. If a single Blower and flare assembly and common header system are used, open all control valves and set the blower vacuum equal to the highest stabilized blower vacuum demonstrated by any individual well in section 8.7. Every 8 hr, sample the LFG from the well head sample port, measure the gauge pressures of the shallow pressure probes, the blower vacuum, the LFG flow rate, and use the criteria for infiltration in section 8.7.2 and Method 3C to test for infiltration. If infiltration is detected, do not reduce the blower vacuum, instead reduce the LFG flow rate from the well by adjusting the control valve on the well head. Adjust each affected well individually. Continue until the equivalent of two total void volumes (V<E T="52">v</E>) have been extracted, or until V<E T="52">t</E> = 2V<E T="52">v</E>.</P>
            <P>8.9.1 Calculate V<E T="52">t</E>, the total volume of LFG extracted from the wells, as shown in section 12.8.</P>
            <P>8.9.2 Record the final stabilized flow rate as Q<E T="52">f</E> and the gauge pressure for each deep probe. If, during the long term testing, the flow rate does not stabilize, calculate Q<E T="52">f</E> by averaging the last 10 recorded flow rates.</P>

            <P>8.9.3 For each deep probe, convert each gauge pressure to absolute pressure as in section 12.4. Average these values and record as P<E T="52">sa</E>. For each probe, compare P<E T="52">ia</E> to P<E T="52">sa</E>. Determine the furthermost point from the well head along each radial arm where P<E T="52">sa</E> ≤P<E T="52">ia</E>. This distance is the stabilized radius of influence. Average these values to determine the average stabilized radius of influence (R<E T="52">sa</E>).</P>
            <P>8.10 Determine the NMOC mass emission rate using the procedures in section 12.9 through 12.15.</P>

Use the procedures in section 8, 12.5, 12.6, and 12.7 of Method 2 to determine the average dry gas volumetric flow rate for at least five flow rates that bracket the expected LFG flow rates, except in section 8.1, use a standard pitot tube rather than a Type S pitot tube. Method 3C may be used to determine the dry molecular weight. It may be necessary to calibrate more than one orifice meter in order to bracket the LFG flow rates. Construct a calibration curve by plotting the pressure drops across the orifice meter for each flow rate versus the average dry gas volumetric flow rate in m<SU>3</SU>/min of the gas.</P>

            <FP>1.1 This method is applicable for the determination of yaw angle, pitch angle, axial velocity and the volumetric flow rate of a gas <PRTPAGE P="47"/>stream in a stack or duct using a three-dimensional (3-D) probe. This method may be used only when the average stack or duct gas velocity is greater than or equal to 20 ft/sec. When the above condition cannot be met, alternative procedures, approved by the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, shall be used to make accurate flow rate determinations.</FP>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>2.1 A 3-D probe is used to determine the velocity pressure and the yaw and pitch angles of the flow velocity vector in a stack or duct. The method determines the yaw angle directly by rotating the probe to null the pressure across a pair of symmetrically placed ports on the probe head. The pitch angle is calculated using probe-specific calibration curves. From these values and a determination of the stack gas density, the average axial velocity of the stack gas is calculated. The average gas volumetric flow rate in the stack or duct is then determined from the average axial velocity.</P>

            <P>6.1.3 <E T="03">A manual 3-D probe</E> refers to a five-hole prism-shaped or spherical probe that is positioned at individual traverse points and yaw nulled manually by an operator. An automated 3-D probe refers to a system that uses a computer-controlled motorized mechanism to position the five-hole prism-shaped or spherical head at individual traverse points and perform yaw angle determinations.</P>
            <P>6.1.4 <E T="03">Other three-dimensional probes.</E> [Reserved]</P>
            <P>6.1.5 <E T="03">Probe sheath.</E> The probe shaft shall include an outer sheath to: (1) provide a surface for inscribing a permanent reference scribe line, (2) accommodate attachment of an angle-measuring device to the probe shaft, and (3) facilitate precise rotational movement of the probe for determining yaw angles. The sheath shall be rigidly attached to the probe assembly and shall enclose all pressure lines from the probe head to the farthest position away from the probe head where an angle-measuring device may be attached during use in the field. The sheath of the fully assembled probe shall be sufficiently rigid and straight at all rotational positions such that, when one end of the probe shaft is held in a horizontal position, the fully extended probe meets the horizontal straightness specifications indicated in section 8.2 below.</P>
            <P>6.1.6 <E T="03">Scribe lines.</E>
            </P>
            <P>6.1.6.1 <E T="03">Reference scribe line.</E> A permanent line, no greater than 1.6 mm (1/16 in.) in width, shall be inscribed on each manual probe that will be used to determine yaw angles of flow. This line shall be placed on the main probe sheath in accordance with the procedures described in section 10.4 and is used as a reference position for installation of the yaw angle-measuring device on the probe. At the discretion of the tester, the scribe line may be a single line segment placed at a particular position on the probe sheath (e.g., near the probe head), multiple line segments placed at various locations along the length of the probe sheath (e.g., at every position where a yaw angle-measuring device may be mounted), or a single continuous line extending along the full length of the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>6.1.6.2 <E T="03">Scribe line on probe extensions.</E> A permanent line may also be inscribed on any probe extension that will be attached to the main probe in performing field testing. This allows a yaw angle-measuring device mounted on the extension to be readily aligned with the reference scribe line on the main probe sheath.</P>
            <P>6.1.6.3 <E T="03">Alignment specifications.</E> This specification shall be met separately, using the procedures in section 10.4.1, on the main probe and on each probe extension. The rotational position of the scribe line or scribe line segments on the main probe or any probe extension must not vary by more than 2°. That is, the difference between the minimum and maximum of all of the rotational angles that are measured along the full length of the main probe or the probe extension must not exceed 2°.</P>
            <P>6.1.7 Probe and system characteristics to ensure horizontal stability.</P>
            <P>6.1.7.1 For manual probes, it is recommended that the effective length of the probe (coupled with a probe extension, if necessary) be at least 0.9 m (3 ft.) longer than the farthest traverse point mark on the probe shaft away from the probe head. The operator should maintain the probe's horizontal stability when it is fully inserted into the stack or duct. If a shorter probe is used, the probe should be inserted through a bushing sleeve, similar to the one shown in Figure 2F-5, that is installed on the test port; such a bushing shall fit snugly around the probe and be secured to the stack or duct entry port in such a manner as to maintain the probe's horizontal stability when fully inserted into the stack or duct.</P>
            <P>6.1.7.2 An automated system that includes an external probe casing with a transport system shall have a mechanism for maintaining horizontal stability comparable to that obtained by manual probes following the provisions of this method. The automated probe assembly shall also be constructed to maintain the alignment and position of the pressure ports during sampling at each traverse point. The design of the probe casing and transport system shall allow the probe to be removed from the stack or duct and checked through direct physical measurement for angular position and insertion depth.</P>
            <P>6.1.8 The tubing that is used to connect the probe and the pressure-measuring device should have an inside diameter of at least 3.2 mm (1/8 in.), to reduce the time required for pressure equilibration, and should be as short as practicable.</P>
            <P>6.2 Yaw Angle-measuring Device. One of the following devices shall be used for measurement of the yaw angle of flow.</P>

            <P>6.2.1 Digital inclinometer. This refers to a digital device capable of measuring and displaying the rotational position of the probe to within ±1°. The device shall be able to be locked into position on the probe sheath or probe extension, so that it indicates the probe's rotational position throughout the test. A rotational position collar block that can be attached to the probe sheath (similar <PRTPAGE P="50"/>to the collar shown in Figure 2F-6) may be required to lock the digital inclinometer into position on the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>6.2.2 Protractor wheel and pointer assembly. This apparatus, similar to that shown in Figure 2F-7, consists of the following components.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.1 A protractor wheel that can be attached to a port opening and set in a fixed rotational position to indicate the yaw angle position of the probe's scribe line relative to the longitudinal axis of the stack or duct. The protractor wheel must have a measurement ring on its face that is no less than 17.8 cm (7 in.) in diameter, shall be able to be rotated to any angle and then locked into position on the stack or duct port, and shall indicate angles to a resolution of 1°.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.2 A pointer assembly that includes an indicator needle mounted on a collar that can slide over the probe sheath and be locked into a fixed rotational position on the probe sheath. The pointer needle shall be of sufficient length, rigidity, and sharpness to allow the tester to determine the probe's angular position to within 1° from the markings on the protractor wheel. Corresponding to the position of the pointer, the collar must have a scribe line to be used in aligning the pointer with the scribe line on the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>6.2.3 Other yaw angle-measuring devices. Other angle-measuring devices with a manufacturer's specified precision of 1° or better may be used, if approved by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.3 Probe Supports and Stabilization Devices. When probes are used for determining flow angles, the probe head should be kept in a stable horizontal position. For probes longer than 3.0 m (10 ft.), the section of the probe that extends outside the test port shall be secured. Three alternative devices are suggested for maintaining the horizontal position and stability of the probe shaft during flow angle determinations and velocity pressure measurements: (1) Monorails installed above each port, (2) probe stands on which the probe shaft may be rested, or (3) bushing sleeves of sufficient length secured to the test ports to maintain probes in a horizontal position. Comparable provisions shall be made to ensure that automated systems maintain the horizontal position of the probe in the stack or duct. The physical characteristics of each test platform may dictate the most suitable type of stabilization device. Thus, the choice of a specific stabilization device is left to the judgment of the testers.</P>

            <P>6.4 Differential Pressure Gauges. The pressure (ΔP) measuring devices used during wind tunnel calibrations and field testing shall be either electronic manometers (e.g., pressure transducers), fluid manometers, or mechanical pressure gauges (e.g., Magnehelic<E T="51">Δ</E> gauges). Use of electronic manometers is recommended. Under low velocity conditions, use of electronic manometers may be necessary to obtain acceptable measurements.</P>

            <P>6.4.1 Differential pressure-measuring device. This refers to a device capable of measuring pressure differentials and having a readability of ±1 percent of full scale. The device shall be capable of accurately measuring the maximum expected pressure differential. Such devices are used to determine the following pressure measurements: velocity pressure, static pressure, yaw-null pressure, and pitch-angle pressure. For an inclined-vertical manometer, the readability specification of ±1 percent shall be met separately using the respective full-scale upper limits of the inclined and vertical portions of the scales. To the extent practicable, the device shall be selected such that most of the pressure readings are between 10 and 90 percent of the device's full-scale measurement range (as defined in section 3.5). Typical velocity pressure (P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">2</E>) ranges for both the prism-shaped probe and the spherical probe are 0 to 1.3 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0 to 0.5 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), 0 to 5.1 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0 to 2 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), and 0 to 12.7 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0 to 5 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O). The pitch angle (P<E T="52">4</E>-P<E T="52">5</E>) pressure range is typically −6.4 to + 6.4 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (−0.25 to + 0.25 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) or −12.7 to + 12.7 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (−0.5 to + 0.5 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) for the prism-shaped probe, and −12.7 to + 12.7 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (−0.5 to + 0.5 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) or −5.1 to + 5.1 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (−2 to + 2 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) for the spherical probe. The pressure range for the yaw null (P<E T="52">2</E>-P<E T="52">3</E>) readings is typically −12.7 to + 12.7 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (−0.5 to + 0.5 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) for both probe types. In addition, pressure-measuring devices should be selected such that the zero does not drift by more than 5 percent of the average expected pressure readings to be encountered during the field test. This is particularly important under low pressure conditions.</P>

            <P>6.4.2 Gauge used for yaw nulling. The differential pressure-measuring device chosen for yaw nulling the probe during the wind tunnel calibrations and field testing shall be bi-directional, i.e., capable of reading both positive and negative differential pressures. If a mechanical, bi-directional pressure gauge is chosen, it shall have a full-scale range no greater than 2.6 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (1 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) [i.e., −1.3 to + 1.3 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (−0.5 in. to + 0.5 in.)].</P>

            <P>6.4.3 Devices for calibrating differential pressure-measuring devices. A precision manometer (e.g., a U-tube, inclined, or inclined-vertical manometer, or micromanometer) or NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable pressure source shall be used for calibrating differential pressure-measuring devices. The device shall be maintained under laboratory conditions or in a similar protected environment (e.g., a climate-controlled trailer). It shall not be used in field tests. The precision manometer shall have a scale gradation of 0.3 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.01 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), or less, in the range of 0 to 5.1 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O <PRTPAGE P="51"/>(0 to 2 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) and 2.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.1 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), or less, in the range of 5.1 to 25.4 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (2 to 10 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O). The manometer shall have manufacturer's documentation that it meets an accuracy specification of at least 0.5 percent of full scale. The NIST-traceable pressure source shall be recertified annually.</P>
            <P>6.4.4 Devices used for post-test calibration check. A precision manometer meeting the specifications in section 6.4.3, a pressure-measuring device or pressure source with a documented calibration traceable to NIST, or an equivalent device approved by the Administrator shall be used for the post-test calibration check. The pressure-measuring device shall have a readability equivalent to or greater than the tested device. The pressure source shall be capable of generating pressures between 50 and 90 percent of the range of the tested device and known to within ±1 percent of the full scale of the tested device. The pressure source shall be recertified annually.</P>
            <P>6.5 Data Display and Capture Devices. Electronic manometers (if used) shall be coupled with a data display device (such as a digital panel meter, personal computer display, or strip chart) that allows the tester to observe and validate the pressure measurements taken during testing. They shall also be connected to a data recorder (such as a data logger or a personal computer with data capture software) that has the ability to compute and retain the appropriate average value at each traverse point, identified by collection time and traverse point.</P>
            <P>6.6 Temperature Gauges. For field tests, a thermocouple or resistance temperature detector (RTD) capable of measuring temperature to within ±3 °C (±5 °F) of the stack or duct temperature shall be used. The thermocouple shall be attached to the probe such that the sensor tip does not touch any metal and is located on the opposite side of the probe head from the pressure ports so as not to interfere with the gas flow around the probe head. The position of the thermocouple relative to the pressure port face openings shall be in the same configuration as used for the probe calibrations in the wind tunnel. Temperature gauges used for wind tunnel calibrations shall be capable of measuring temperature to within ±0.6 °C (±1 °F) of the temperature of the flowing gas stream in the wind tunnel.</P>

            <P>6.7 Stack or Duct Static Pressure Measurement. The pressure-measuring device used with the probe shall be as specified in section 6.4 of this method. The static tap of a standard (Prandtl type) pitot tube or one leg of a Type S pitot tube with the face opening planes positioned parallel to the gas flow may be used for this measurement. Also acceptable is the pressure differential reading of P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">bar</E> from a five-hole prism-shaped probe (e.g., Type DA or DAT probe) with the P<E T="52">1</E> pressure port face opening positioned parallel to the gas flow in the same manner as the Type S probe. However, the spherical probe, as specified in section 6.1.2, is unable to provide this measurement and shall not be used to take static pressure measurements. Static pressure measurement is further described in section 8.11.</P>
            <P>6.8 Barometer. Same as Method 2, section 2.5.</P>
            <P>6.9 Gas Density Determination Equipment. Method 3 or 3A shall be used to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. Method 4 shall be used for moisture content determination and computation of stack gas wet molecular weight. Other methods may be used, if approved by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.10 Calibration Pitot Tube. Same as Method 2, section 2.7.</P>
            <P>6.11 Wind Tunnel for Probe Calibration. Wind tunnels used to calibrate velocity probes must meet the following design specifications.</P>
            <P>6.11.1 Test section cross-sectional area. The flowing gas stream shall be confined within a circular, rectangular, or elliptical duct. The cross-sectional area of the tunnel must be large enough to ensure fully developed flow in the presence of both the calibration pitot tube and the tested probe. The calibration site, or “test section,” of the wind tunnel shall have a minimum diameter of 30.5 cm (12 in.) for circular or elliptical duct cross-sections or a minimum width of 30.5 cm (12 in.) on the shorter side for rectangular cross-sections. Wind tunnels shall meet the probe blockage provisions of this section and the qualification requirements prescribed in section 10.1. The projected area of the portion of the probe head, shaft, and attached devices inside the wind tunnel during calibration shall represent no more than 4 percent of the cross-sectional area of the tunnel. The projected area shall include the combined area of the calibration pitot tube and the tested probe if both probes are placed simultaneously in the same cross-sectional plane in the wind tunnel, or the larger projected area of the two probes if they are placed alternately in the wind tunnel.</P>
            <P>6.11.2 Velocity range and stability. The wind tunnel should be capable of maintaining velocities between 6.1 m/sec and 30.5 m/sec (20 ft/sec and 100 ft/sec). The wind tunnel shall produce fully developed flow patterns that are stable and parallel to the axis of the duct in the test section.</P>
            <P>6.11.3 Flow profile at the calibration location. The wind tunnel shall provide axial flow within the test section calibration location (as defined in section 3.20). Yaw and pitch angles in the calibration location shall be within ±3° of 0°. The procedure for determining that this requirement has been met is described in section 10.1.2.</P>

            <P>6.11.4 Entry ports in the wind tunnel test section.<PRTPAGE P="52"/>
            </P>
            <P>6.11.4.1 Port for tested probe. A port shall be constructed for the tested probe. The port should have an elongated slot parallel to the axis of the duct at the test section. The elongated slot should be of sufficient length to allow attaining all the pitch angles at which the probe will be calibrated for use in the field. To facilitate alignment of the probe during calibration, the test section should include a window constructed of a transparent material to allow the tested probe to be viewed. This port shall be located to allow the head of the tested probe to be positioned within the calibration location (as defined in section 3.20) at all pitch angle settings.</P>
            <P>6.11.4.2 Port for verification of axial flow. Depending on the equipment selected to conduct the axial flow verification prescribed in section 10.1.2, a second port, located 90° from the entry port for the tested probe, may be needed to allow verification that the gas flow is parallel to the central axis of the test section. This port should be located and constructed so as to allow one of the probes described in section 10.1.2.2 to access the same test point(s) that are accessible from the port described in section 6.11.4.1.</P>
            <P>6.11.4.3 Port for calibration pitot tube. The calibration pitot tube shall be used in the port for the tested probe or a separate entry port. In either case, all measurements with the calibration pitot tube shall be made at the same point within the wind tunnel over the course of a probe calibration. The measurement point for the calibration pitot tube shall meet the same specifications for distance from the wall and for axial flow as described in section 3.20 for the wind tunnel calibration location.</P>
            <P>6.11.5 Pitch angle protractor plate. A protractor plate shall be attached directly under the port used with the tested probe and set in a fixed position to indicate the pitch angle position of the probe relative to the longitudinal axis of the wind tunnel duct (similar to Figure 2F-8). The protractor plate shall indicate angles in 5° increments with a minimum resolution of ±2°. The tested probe shall be able to be locked into position at the desired pitch angle delineated on the protractor. The probe head position shall be maintained within the calibration location (as defined in section 3.20) in the test section of the wind tunnel during all tests across the range of pitch angles.</P>

            <P>8.1 Equipment Inspection and Set-Up</P>
            <P>8.1.1 All probes, differential pressure-measuring devices, yaw angle-measuring devices, thermocouples, and barometers shall have a current, valid calibration before being used in a field test. (See sections 10.3.3, 10.3.4, and 10.5 through10.10 for the applicable calibration requirements.)</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Before each field use of a 3-D probe, perform a visual inspection to verify the physical condition of the probe head according to the procedures in section 10.2. Record the inspection results on a form similar to Table 2F-1. If there is visible damage to the 3-D probe, the probe shall not be used until it is recalibrated.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 After verifying that the physical condition of the probe head is acceptable, set up the apparatus using lengths of flexible tubing that are as short as practicable. Surge tanks installed between the probe and pressure-measuring device may be used to dampen pressure fluctuations provided that an adequate measurement response time (see section 8.8) is maintained.</P>
            <P>8.2 Horizontal Straightness Check. A horizontal straightness check shall be performed before the start of each field test, except as otherwise specified in this section. Secure the fully assembled probe (including the probe head and all probe shaft extensions) in a horizontal position using a stationary support at a point along the probe shaft approximating the location of the stack or duct entry port when the probe is sampling at the farthest traverse point from the stack or duct wall. The probe shall be rotated to detect bends. Use an angle-measuring device or trigonometry to determine the bend or sag between the probe head and the secured end. (See Figure 2F-9.) Probes that are bent or sag by more than 5° shall not be used. Although this check does not apply when the probe is used for a vertical traverse, care should be taken to avoid the use of bent probes when conducting vertical traverses. If the probe is constructed of a rigid steel material and consists of a main probe without probe extensions, this check need only be performed before the initial field use of the probe, when the probe is recalibrated, when a change is made to the design or material of the probe assembly, and when the probe becomes bent. With such probes, a visual inspection shall be made of the fully assembled probe before each field test to determine if a bend is visible. The probe shall be rotated to detect bends. The inspection results shall be documented in the field test report. If a bend in the probe is visible, the horizontal straightness check shall be performed before the probe is used.</P>

            <P>8.3 Rotational Position Check. Before each field test, and each time an extension is added to the probe during a field test, a rotational position check shall be performed on all manually operated probes (except as noted in section 8.3.5, below) to ensure that, throughout testing, the angle-measuring device is either: aligned to within ±1° of the rotational position of the reference scribe line; or is affixed to the probe such that the rotational offset of the device from the reference scribe line is known to within ±1°. This check shall consist of direct measurements of the <PRTPAGE P="53"/>rotational positions of the reference scribe line and angle-measuring device sufficient to verify that these specifications are met. Annex A in section 18 of this method gives recommended procedures for performing the rotational position check, and Table 2F-2 gives an example data form. Procedures other than those recommended in Annex A in section 18 may be used, provided they demonstrate whether the alignment specification is met and are explained in detail in the field test report.</P>

            <P>8.3.1 Angle-measuring device rotational offset. The tester shall maintain a record of the angle-measuring device rotational offset, R<E T="52">ADO</E>, as defined in section 3.1. Note that R<E T="52">ADO</E> is assigned a value of 0° when the angle-measuring device is aligned to within ±1° of the rotational position of the reference scribe line. The R<E T="52">ADO</E> shall be used to determine the yaw angle of flow in accordance with section 8.9.4.</P>

            <P>8.3.2 Sign of angle-measuring device rotational offset. The sign of R<E T="52">ADO</E> is positive when the angle-measuring device (as viewed from the “tail” end of the probe) is positioned in a clockwise direction from the reference scribe line and negative when the device is positioned in a counterclockwise direction from the reference scribe line.</P>

            <P>8.3.3 Angle-measuring devices that can be independently adjusted (e.g., by means of a set screw), after being locked into position on the probe sheath, may be used. However, the R<E T="52">ADO</E> must also take into account this adjustment.</P>
            <P>8.3.4 Post-test check. If probe extensions remain attached to the main probe throughout the field test, the rotational position check shall be repeated, at a minimum, at the completion of the field test to ensure that the angle-measuring device has remained within ±2° of its rotational position established prior to testing. At the discretion of the tester, additional checks may be conducted after completion of testing at any sample port or after any test run. If the ±2° specification is not met, all measurements made since the last successful rotational position check must be repeated. section 18.1.1.3 of Annex A provides an example procedure for performing the post-test check.</P>
            <P>8.3.5 Exceptions.</P>
            <P>8.3.5.1 A rotational position check need not be performed if, for measurements taken at all velocity traverse points, the yaw angle-measuring device is mounted and aligned directly on the reference scribe line specified in sections 6.1.6.1 and 6.1.6.3 and no independent adjustments, as described in section 8.3.3, are made to the device's rotational position.</P>
            <P>8.3.5.2 If extensions are detached and re-attached to the probe during a field test, a rotational position check need only be performed the first time an extension is added to the probe, rather than each time the extension is re-attached, if the probe extension is designed to be locked into a mechanically fixed rotational position (e.g., through use of interlocking grooves) that can re-establish the initial rotational position to within ±1°.</P>
            <P>8.4 Leak Checks. A pre-test leak check shall be conducted before each field test. A post-test check shall be performed at the end of the field test, but additional leak checks may be conducted after any test run or group of test runs. The post-test check may also serve as the pre-test check for the next group of test runs. If any leak check is failed, all runs since the last passed leak check are invalid. While performing the leak check procedures, also check each pressure device's responsiveness to the changes in pressure.</P>

            <P>8.4.1 To perform the leak check, pressurize the probe's P<E T="52">1</E> pressure port until at least 7.6 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (3 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) pressure, or a pressure corresponding to approximately 75 percent of the pressure-measuring device's measurement scale, whichever is less, registers on the device; then, close off the pressure port. The pressure shall remain stable [±2.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (±0.10 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O)] for at least 15 seconds. Check the P<E T="52">2</E>, P<E T="52">3</E>, P<E T="52">4</E>, and P<E T="52">5</E> pressure ports in the same fashion. Other leak-check procedures may be used, if approved by the Administrator.</P>

            <P>8.5 Zeroing the Differential Pressure-measuring Device. Zero each differential pressure-measuring device, including the device used for yaw nulling, before each field test. At a minimum, check the zero after each field test. A zero check may also be performed after any test run or group of test runs. For fluid manometers and mechanical pressure gauges (e.g., Magnehelic<E T="51">Δ</E> gauges), the zero reading shall not deviate from zero by more than ±0.8 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (±0.03 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) or one minor scale division, whichever is greater, between checks. For electronic manometers, the zero reading shall not deviate from zero between checks by more than: ±0.3 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (±0.01 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), for full scales less than or equal to 5.1 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (2.0 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O); or ±0.8 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (±0.03 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), for full scales greater than 5.1 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (2.0 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O). (Note: If negative zero drift is not directly readable, estimate the reading based on the position of the gauge oil in the manometer or of the needle on the pressure gauge.) In addition, for all pressure-measuring devices except those used exclusively for yaw nulling, the zero reading shall not deviate from zero by more than 5 percent of the average measured differential pressure at any distinct process condition or load level. If any zero check is failed at a specific process condition or load level, all runs conducted at that process condition or load level since the last passed zero check are invalid.</P>

            <P>8.6 Traverse Point Verification. The number and location of the traverse points shall be selected based on Method 1 guidelines. <PRTPAGE P="54"/>The stack or duct diameter and port nipple lengths, including any extension of the port nipples into stack or duct, shall be verified the first time the test is performed; retain and use this information for subsequent field tests, updating it as required. Physically measure the stack or duct dimensions or use a calibrated laser device; do not use engineering drawings of the stack or duct. The probe length necessary to reach each traverse point shall be recorded to within ±6.4 mm (±1/4 in.) and, for manual probes, marked on the probe sheath. In determining these lengths, the tester shall take into account both the distance that the port flange projects outside of the stack and the depth that any port nipple extends into the gas stream. The resulting point positions shall reflect the true distances from the inside wall of the stack or duct, so that when the tester aligns any of the markings with the outside face of the stack port, the probe's impact port shall be located at the appropriate distance from the inside wall for the respective Method 1 traverse point. Before beginning testing at a particular location, an out-of-stack or duct verification shall be performed on each probe that will be used to ensure that these position markings are correct. The distances measured during the verification must agree with the previously calculated distances to within ±1/4 in. For manual probes, the traverse point positions shall be verified by measuring the distance of each mark from the probe's P<E T="52">1</E> pressure port. A comparable out-of-stack test shall be performed on automated probe systems. The probe shall be extended to each of the prescribed traverse point positions. Then, the accuracy of the positioning for each traverse point shall be verified by measuring the distance between the port flange and the probe's P<E T="52">1</E> pressure port.</P>
            <P>8.7 Probe Installation. Insert the probe into the test port. A solid material shall be used to seal the port.</P>

            <P>8.8 System Response Time. Determine the response time of the probe measurement system. Insert and position the “cold” probe (at ambient temperature and pressure) at any Method 1 traverse point. Read and record the probe's P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">2</E> differential pressure, temperature, and elapsed time at 15-second intervals until stable readings for both pressure and temperature are achieved. The response time is the longer of these two elapsed times. Record the response time.</P>
            <P>8.9 Sampling.</P>
            <P>8.9.1 Yaw angle measurement protocol. With manual probes, yaw angle measurements may be obtained in two alternative ways during the field test, either by using a yaw angle-measuring device (e.g., digital inclinometer) affixed to the probe, or using a protractor wheel and pointer assembly. For horizontal traversing, either approach may be used. For vertical traversing, i.e., when measuring from on top or into the bottom of a horizontal duct, only the protractor wheel and pointer assembly may be used. With automated probes, curve-fitting protocols may be used to obtain yaw-angle measurements.</P>
            <P>8.9.1.1 If a yaw angle-measuring device affixed to the probe is to be used, lock the device on the probe sheath, aligning it either on the reference scribe line or in the rotational offset position established under section 8.3.1.</P>
            <P>8.9.1.2 If a protractor wheel and pointer assembly is to be used, follow the procedures in Annex B of this method.</P>
            <P>8.9.1.3 Other yaw angle-determination procedures. If approved by the Administrator, other procedures for determining yaw angle may be used, provided that they are verified in a wind tunnel to be able to perform the yaw angle calibration procedure as described in section 10.5.</P>
            <P>8.9.2 Sampling strategy. At each traverse point, first yaw-null the probe, as described in section 8.9.3, below. Then, with the probe oriented into the direction of flow, measure and record the yaw angle, the differential pressures and the temperature at the traverse point, after stable readings are achieved, in accordance with sections 8.9.4 and 8.9.5. At the start of testing in each port (i.e., after a probe has been inserted into the flue gas stream), allow at least the response time to elapse before beginning to take measurements at the first traverse point accessed from that port. Provided that the probe is not removed from the flue gas stream, measurements may be taken at subsequent traverse points accessed from the same test port without waiting again for the response time to elapse.</P>
            <P>8.9.3 Yaw-nulling procedure. In preparation for yaw angle determination, the probe must first be yaw nulled. After positioning the probe at the appropriate traverse point, perform the following procedures.</P>

            <P>8.9.3.1 Rotate the probe until a null differential pressure reading (the difference in pressures across the P<E T="52">2</E> and P<E T="52">3</E> pressure ports is zero, i.e., P<E T="52">2</E> = P<E T="52">3</E>) is indicated by the yaw angle pressure gauge. Read and record the angle displayed by the angle-measuring device.</P>
            <P>8.9.3.2 Sign of the measured angle. The angle displayed on the angle-measuring device is considered positive when the probe's impact pressure port (as viewed from the “tail” end of the probe) is oriented in a clockwise rotational position relative to the stack or duct axis and is considered negative when the probe's impact pressure port is oriented in a counterclockwise rotational position (see Figure 2F-10).</P>

            <P>8.9.4 Yaw angle determination. After performing the yaw-nulling procedure in section <PRTPAGE P="55"/>8.9.3, determine the yaw angle of flow according to one of the following procedures. Special care must be observed to take into account the signs of the recorded angle and all offsets.</P>

            <P>8.9.4.1 Direct-reading. If all rotational offsets are zero or if the angle-measuring device rotational offset (R<E T="52">ADO</E>) determined in section 8.3 exactly compensates for the scribe line rotational offset (R<E T="52">SLO</E>) determined in section 10.5, then the magnitude of the yaw angle is equal to the displayed angle-measuring device reading from section 8.9.3.1. The algebraic sign of the yaw angle is determined in accordance with section 8.9.3.2.

              <P>Under certain circumstances (e.g., testing of horizontal ducts), a 90° adjustment to the angle-measuring device readings may be necessary to obtain the correct yaw angles.</P>

            <P>8.9.4.2 Compensation for rotational offsets during data reduction. When the angle-measuring device rotational offset does not compensate for reference scribe line rotational offset, the following procedure shall be used to determine the yaw angle:</P>
            <P>(a) Enter the reading indicated by the angle-measuring device from section 8.9.3.1.</P>
            <P>(b) Associate the proper algebraic sign from section 8.9.3.2 with the reading in step (a).</P>

            <P>(c) Subtract the reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>, from the reading in step (b).</P>

            <P>(d) Subtract the angle-measuring device rotational offset, R<E T="52">ADO</E>, if any, from the result obtained in step (c).</P>

            <P>(e) The final result obtained in step (d) is the yaw angle of flow.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>It may be necessary to first apply a 90° adjustment to the reading in step (a), in order to obtain the correct yaw angle.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.9.4.3 Record the yaw angle measurements on a form similar to Table 2F-3.</P>

            <P>8.9.5 Velocity determination. Maintain the probe rotational position established during the yaw angle determination. Then, begin recording the pressure-measuring device readings for the impact pressure (P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">2</E>) and pitch angle pressure (P<E T="52">4</E>-P<E T="52">5</E>). These pressure measurements shall be taken over a sampling period of sufficiently long duration to ensure representative readings at each traverse point. If the pressure measurements are determined from visual readings of the pressure device or display, allow sufficient time to observe the pulsation in the readings to obtain a sight-weighted average, which is then recorded manually. If an automated data acquisition system (e.g., data logger, computer-based data recorder, strip chart recorder) is used to record the pressure measurements, obtain an integrated average of all pressure readings at the traverse point. Stack or duct gas temperature measurements shall be recorded, at a minimum, once at each traverse point. Record all necessary data as shown in the example field data form (Table 2F-3).</P>
            <P>8.9.6 Alignment check. For manually operated probes, after the required yaw angle and differential pressure and temperature measurements have been made at each traverse point, verify (e.g., by visual inspection) that the yaw angle-measuring device has remained in proper alignment with the reference scribe line or with the rotational offset position established in section 8.3. If, for a particular traverse point, the angle-measuring device is found to be in proper alignment, proceed to the next traverse point; otherwise, re-align the device and repeat the angle and differential pressure measurements at the traverse point. In the course of a traverse, if a mark used to properly align the angle-measuring device (e.g., as described in section 18.1.1.1) cannot be located, re-establish the alignment mark before proceeding with the traverse.</P>
            <P>8.10 Probe Plugging. Periodically check for plugging of the pressure ports by observing the responses on pressure differential readouts. Plugging causes erratic results or sluggish responses. Rotate the probe to determine whether the readouts respond in the expected direction. If plugging is detected, correct the problem and repeat the affected measurements.</P>
            <P>8.11 Static Pressure. Measure the static pressure in the stack or duct using the equipment described in section 6.7.</P>

            <P>8.11.1 If a Type DA or DAT probe is used for this measurement, position the probe at or between any traverse point(s) and rotate the probe until a null differential pressure reading is obtained at P<E T="52">2</E>-P<E T="52">3</E>. Rotate the probe 90°. Disconnect the P<E T="52">2</E> pressure side of the probe and read the pressure P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">bar</E> and record as the static pressure. (<E T="04">Note</E>: The spherical probe, specified in section 6.1.2, is unable to provide this measurement and shall not be used to take static pressure measurements.)</P>
            <P>8.11.2 If a Type S probe is used for this measurement, position the probe at or between any traverse point(s) and rotate the probe until a null differential pressure reading is obtained. Disconnect the tubing from one of the pressure ports; read and record the ΔP. For pressure devices with one-directional scales, if a deflection in the positive direction is noted with the negative side disconnected, then the static pressure is positive. Likewise, if a deflection in the positive direction is noted with the positive side disconnected, then the static pressure is negative.</P>

For horizontal traverses of a stack or duct, visually check that the probe shaft is maintained in a horizontal position prior to taking a pressure reading. Periodically, during a test run, the probe's horizontal stability should be verified by placing a carpenter's level, a digital inclinometer, or other angle-measuring device on the portion of the probe sheath that extends outside of the test port. A comparable check should be performed by automated systems.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 Calibration</HD>
            <P>10.1 Wind Tunnel Qualification Checks. To qualify for use in calibrating probes, a wind tunnel shall have the design features specified in section 6.11 and satisfy the following qualification criteria. The velocity pressure cross-check in section 10.1.1 and axial flow verification in section 10.1.2 shall be performed before the initial use of the wind tunnel and repeated immediately after any alteration occurs in the wind tunnel's configuration, fans, interior surfaces, straightening vanes, controls, or other properties that could reasonably be expected to alter the flow pattern or velocity stability in the tunnel. The owner or operator of a wind tunnel used to calibrate probes according to this method shall maintain records documenting that the wind tunnel meets the requirements of sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 and shall provide these records to the Administrator upon request.</P>

            <P>10.1.1 Velocity pressure cross-check. To verify that the wind tunnel produces the same velocity at the tested probe head as at the calibration pitot tube impact port, perform the following cross-check. Take three differential pressure measurements at the fixed calibration pitot tube location, using the calibration pitot tube specified in section 6.10, and take three measurements with the calibration pitot tube at the wind tunnel calibration location, as defined in section 3.20. Alternate the measurements between the two positions. Perform this procedure at the lowest and highest velocity settings at which the probes will be calibrated. Record the values on a form similar to Table 2F-4. At each velocity setting, the average velocity pressure obtained at the wind tunnel calibration location shall be within ±2 percent or 2.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.01 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), whichever is less restrictive, of the average velocity pressure obtained at the fixed calibration pitot tube location. This comparative check shall be performed at 2.5-cm (1-in.), or smaller, intervals across the full length, width, and depth (if applicable) of the wind tunnel calibration location. If the criteria are not met at every tested point, the wind tunnel calibration location must be redefined, so that acceptable results are obtained at every point. Include the results of the velocity pressure cross-check in the calibration data section of the field test report. (See section 16.1.4.)</P>

            <P>10.1.2 Axial flow verification. The following procedures shall be performed to demonstrate that there is fully developed axial flow within the calibration location and at <PRTPAGE P="57"/>the calibration pitot tube location. Two testing options are available to conduct this check.</P>
            <P>10.1.2.1 Using a calibrated 3-D probe. A 3-D probe that has been previously calibrated in a wind tunnel with documented axial flow (as defined in section 3.21) may be used to conduct this check. Insert the calibrated 3-D probe into the wind tunnel test section using the tested probe port. Following the procedures in sections 8.9 and 12.2 of this method, determine the yaw and pitch angles at all the point(s) in the test section where the velocity pressure cross-check, as specified in section 10.1.1, is performed. This includes all the points in the calibration location and the point where the calibration pitot tube will be located. Determine the yaw and pitch angles at each point. Repeat these measurements at the highest and lowest velocities at which the probes will be calibrated. Record the values on a form similar to Table 2F-5. Each measured yaw and pitch angle shall be within ±3° of 0°. Exceeding the limits indicates unacceptable flow in the test section. Until the problem is corrected and acceptable flow is verified by repetition of this procedure, the wind tunnel shall not be used for calibration of probes. Include the results of the axial flow verification in the calibration data section of the field test report. (See section 16.1.4.)</P>

            <P>10.1.2.2 Using alternative probes. Axial flow verification may be performed using an uncalibrated prism-shaped 3-D probe (e.g., DA or DAT probe) or an uncalibrated wedge probe. (Figure 2F-11 illustrates a typical wedge probe.) This approach requires use of two ports: the tested probe port and a second port located 90° from the tested probe port. Each port shall provide access to all the points within the wind tunnel test section where the velocity pressure cross-check, as specified in section 10.1.1, is conducted. The probe setup shall include establishing a reference yaw-null position on the probe sheath to serve as the location for installing the angle-measuring device. Physical design features of the DA, DAT, and wedge probes are relied on to determine the reference position. For the DA or DAT probe, this reference position can be determined by setting a digital inclinometer on the flat facet where the P<E T="52">1</E> pressure port is located and then identifying the rotational position on the probe sheath where a second angle-measuring device would give the same angle reading. The reference position on a wedge probe shaft can be determined either geometrically or by placing a digital inclinometer on each side of the wedge and rotating the probe until equivalent readings are obtained. With the latter approach, the reference position is the rotational position on the probe sheath where an angle-measuring device would give a reading of 0°. After installing the angle-measuring device in the reference yaw-null position on the probe sheath, determine the yaw angle from the tested port. Repeat this measurement using the 90° offset port, which provides the pitch angle of flow. Determine the yaw and pitch angles at all the point(s) in the test section where the velocity pressure cross-check, as specified in section 10.1.1, is performed. This includes all the points in the wind tunnel calibration location and the point where the calibration pitot tube will be located. Perform this check at the highest and lowest velocities at which the probes will be calibrated. Record the values on a form similar to Table 2F-5. Each measured yaw and pitch angle shall be within ±3° of 0°. Exceeding the limits indicates unacceptable flow in the test section. Until the problem is corrected and acceptable flow is verified by repetition of this procedure, the wind tunnel shall not be used for calibration of probes. Include the results in the probe calibration report.</P>
            <P>10.1.3 Wind tunnel audits.</P>
            <P>10.1.3.1 Procedure. Upon the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of a wind tunnel shall calibrate a 3-D audit probe in accordance with the procedures described in sections 10.3 through 10.6. The calibration shall be performed at two velocities and over a pitch angle range that encompasses the velocities and pitch angles typically used for this method at the facility. The resulting calibration data and curves shall be submitted to the Agency in an audit test report. These results shall be compared by the Agency to reference calibrations of the audit probe at the same velocity and pitch angle settings obtained at two different wind tunnels.</P>

            <P>10.1.3.2 Acceptance criteria. The audited tunnel's calibration is acceptable if all of the following conditions are satisfied at each velocity and pitch setting for the reference calibration obtained from at least one of the wind tunnels. For pitch angle settings between −15° and + 15°, no velocity calibration coefficient (i.e., F<E T="52">2</E>) may differ from the corresponding reference value by more than 3 percent. For pitch angle settings outside of this range (i.e., less than −15° and greater than + 15°), no velocity calibration coefficient may differ by more than 5 percent from the corresponding reference value. If the acceptance criteria are not met, the audited wind tunnel shall not be used to calibrate probes for use under this method until the problems are resolved and acceptable results are obtained upon completion of a subsequent audit.</P>

            <P>10.2 Probe Inspection. Before each calibration of a 3-D probe, carefully examine the physical condition of the probe head. Particular attention shall be paid to the edges of the pressure ports and the surfaces surrounding these ports. Any dents, scratches, or asymmetries on the edges of the pressure ports and any scratches or indentations on <PRTPAGE P="58"/>the surfaces surrounding the pressure ports shall be noted because of the potential effect on the probe's pressure readings. If the probe has been previously calibrated, compare the current condition of the probe's pressure ports and surfaces to the results of the inspection performed during the probe's most recent wind tunnel calibration. Record the results of this inspection on a form and in diagrams similar to Table 2F-1. The information in Table 2F-1 will be used as the basis for comparison during the probe head inspections performed before each subsequent field use.</P>
            <P>10.3 Pre-Calibration Procedures. Prior to calibration, a scribe line shall have been placed on the probe in accordance with section 10.4. The yaw angle and velocity calibration procedures shall not begin until the pre-test requirements in sections 10.3.1 through 10.3.4 have been met.</P>
            <P>10.3.1 Perform the horizontal straightness check described in section 8.2 on the probe assembly that will be calibrated in the wind tunnel.</P>
            <P>10.3.2 Perform a leak check in accordance with section 8.4.</P>
            <P>10.3.3 Except as noted in section 10.3.3.3, calibrate all differential pressure-measuring devices to be used in the probe calibrations, using the following procedures. At a minimum, calibrate these devices on each day that probe calibrations are performed.</P>

            <P>10.3.3.1 Procedure. Before each wind tunnel use, all differential pressure-measuring devices shall be calibrated against the reference device specified in section 6.4.3 using a common pressure source. Perform the calibration at three reference pressures representing 30, 60, and 90 percent of the full-scale range of the pressure-measuring device being calibrated. For an inclined-vertical manometer, perform separate calibrations on the inclined and vertical portions of the measurement scale, considering each portion of the scale to be a separate full-scale range. [For example, for a manometer with a 0- to 2.5-cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0- to 1-in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) inclined scale and a 2.5- to 12.7-cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (1- to 5-in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) vertical scale, calibrate the inclined portion at 7.6, 15.2, and 22.9 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), and calibrate the vertical portion at 3.8, 7.6, and 11.4 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O).] Alternatively, for the vertical portion of the scale, use three evenly spaced reference pressures, one of which is equal to or higher than the highest differential pressure expected in field applications.</P>

            <P>10.3.3.2 Acceptance criteria. At each pressure setting, the two pressure readings made using the reference device and the pressure-measuring device being calibrated shall agree to within ±2 percent of full scale of the device being calibrated or 0.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.02 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), whichever is less restrictive. For an inclined-vertical manometer, these requirements shall be met separately using the respective full-scale upper limits of the inclined and vertical portions of the scale. Differential pressure-measuring devices not meeting the #2 percent of full scale or 0.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.02 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) calibration requirement shall not be used.</P>
            <P>10.3.3.3 Exceptions. Any precision manometer that meets the specifications for a reference device in section 6.4.3 and that is not used for field testing does not require calibration, but must be leveled and zeroed before each wind tunnel use. Any pressure device used exclusively for yaw nulling does not require calibration, but shall be checked for responsiveness to rotation of the probe prior to each wind tunnel use.</P>

            <P>10.3.4 Calibrate digital inclinometers on each day of wind tunnel or field testing (prior to beginning testing) using the following procedures. Calibrate the inclinometer according to the manufacturer's calibration procedures. In addition, use a triangular block (illustrated in Figure 2F-12) with a known angle, θ independently determined using a protractor or equivalent device, between two adjacent sides to verify the inclinometer readings.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>If other angle-measuring devices meeting the provisions of section 6.2.3 are used in place of a digital inclinometer, comparable calibration procedures shall be performed on such devices.)</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <FP>Secure the triangular block in a fixed position. Place the inclinometer on one side of the block (side A) to measure the angle of inclination (R<E T="52">1</E>). Repeat this measurement on the adjacent side of the block (side B) using the inclinometer to obtain a second angle reading (R<E T="52">2</E>). The difference of the sum of the two readings from 180° (i.e., 180° −R<E T="52">1</E> −R<E T="52">2</E>) shall be within ±2° of the known angle, Θ</FP>
            <P>10.4 Placement of Reference Scribe Line. Prior to the first calibration of a probe, a line shall be permanently inscribed on the main probe sheath to serve as a reference mark for determining yaw angles. Annex C in section 18 of this method gives a guideline for placement of the reference scribe line.</P>

            <P>10.4.1 This reference scribe line shall meet the specifications in sections 6.1.6.1 and 6.1.6.3 of this method. To verify that the alignment specification in section 6.1.6.3 is met, secure the probe in a horizontal position and measure the rotational angle of each scribe line and scribe line segment using an angle-measuring device that meets the specifications in section 6.2.1 or 6.2.3. For any scribe line that is longer than 30.5 cm (12 in.), check the line's rotational position at 30.5-cm (12-in.) intervals. For each line segment that is 30.5 cm (12 in.) or less in length, check the rotational position at the two endpoints of the segment. To meet the alignment specification in section 6.1.6.3, the minimum and maximum of all of the rotational angles that are measured along the full <PRTPAGE P="59"/>length of the main probe must not differ by more than 2°.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>A short reference scribe line segment [e.g., 15.2 cm (6 in.) or less in length] meeting the alignment specifications in section 6.1.6.3 is fully acceptable under this method. See section 18.1.1.1 of Annex A for an example of a probe marking procedure, suitable for use with a short reference scribe line.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>10.4.2 The scribe line should be placed on the probe first and then its offset from the yaw-null position established (as specified in section 10.5). The rotational position of the reference scribe line relative to the yaw-null position of the probe, as determined by the yaw angle calibration procedure in section 10.5, is defined as the reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>. The reference scribe line rotational offset shall be recorded and retained as part of the probe's calibration record.</P>
            <P>10.4.3 Scribe line for automated probes. A scribe line may not be necessary for an automated probe system if a reference rotational position of the probe is built into the probe system design. For such systems, a “flat” (or comparable, clearly identifiable physical characteristic) should be provided on the probe casing or flange plate to ensure that the reference position of the probe assembly remains in a vertical or horizontal position. The rotational offset of the flat (or comparable, clearly identifiable physical characteristic) needed to orient the reference position of the probe assembly shall be recorded and maintained as part of the automated probe system's specifications.</P>
            <P>10.5 Yaw Angle Calibration Procedure. For each probe used to measure yaw angles with this method, a calibration procedure shall be performed in a wind tunnel meeting the specifications in section 10.1 to determine the rotational position of the reference scribe line relative to the probe's yaw-null position. This procedure shall be performed on the main probe with all devices that will be attached to the main probe in the field [such as thermocouples or resistance temperature detectors (RTDs)] that may affect the flow around the probe head. Probe shaft extensions that do not affect flow around the probe head need not be attached during calibration. At a minimum, this procedure shall include the following steps.</P>
            <P>10.5.1 Align and lock the angle-measuring device on the reference scribe line. If a marking procedure (such as that described in section 18.1.1.1) is used, align the angle-measuring device on a mark within ±1° of the rotational position of the reference scribe line. Lock the angle-measuring device onto the probe sheath at this position.</P>
            <P>10.5.2 Zero the pressure-measuring device used for yaw nulling.</P>
            <P>10.5.3 Insert the probe assembly into the wind tunnel through the entry port, positioning the probe's impact port at the calibration location. Check the responsiveness of the pressure-measurement device to probe rotation, taking corrective action if the response is unacceptable.</P>
            <P>10.5.4 Ensure that the probe is in a horizontal position, using a carpenter's level.</P>

            <P>10.5.5 Rotate the probe either clockwise or counterclockwise until a yaw null (P<E T="52">2</E> = P<E T="52">3</E>) is obtained.</P>

            <P>10.5.6 Use the reading displayed by the angle-measuring device at the yaw-null position to determine the magnitude of the reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>, as defined in section 3.15. Annex D in section 18 of this method provides a recommended procedure for determining the magnitude of R<E T="52">SLO</E> with a digital inclinometer and a second procedure for determining the magnitude of R<E T="52">SLO</E> with a protractor wheel and pointer device. Table 2F-6 presents an example data form and Table 2F-7 is a look-up table with the recommended procedure. Procedures other than those recommended in Annex D in section 18 may be used, if they can determine R<E T="52">SLO</E> to within ±1° and are explained in detail in the field test report. The algebraic sign of R<E T="52">SLO</E> will either be positive, if the rotational position of the reference scribe line (as viewed from the “tail” end of the probe) is clockwise, or negative, if counterclockwise with respect to the probe's yaw-null position. (This is illustrated in Figure 2F-13.)</P>

            <P>10.5.7 The steps in sections 10.5.3 through 10.5.6 shall be performed twice at each of the velocities at which the probe will be calibrated (in accordance with section 10.6). Record the values of R<E T="52">SLO</E>.</P>
            <P>10.5.8 The average of all of the R<E T="52">SLO</E> values shall be documented as the reference scribe line rotational offset for the probe.</P>
            <P>10.5.9 Use of reference scribe line offset. The reference scribe line rotational offset shall be used to determine the yaw angle of flow in accordance with section 8.9.4.</P>

            <P>10.6 Pitch Angle and Velocity Pressure Calibrations. Use the procedures in sections 10.6.1 through 10.6.16 to generate an appropriate set (or sets) of pitch angle and velocity pressure calibration curves for each probe. The calibration procedure shall be performed on the main probe and all devices that will be attached to the main probe in the field (e.g., thermocouple or RTDs) that may affect the flow around the probe head. Probe shaft extensions that do not affect flow around the probe head need not be attached during calibration. (Note: If a sampling nozzle is part of the assembly, a wind tunnel demonstration shall be performed that shows the probe's ability to measure velocity and yaw null is not impaired when the nozzle is drawing a sample.) The calibration <PRTPAGE P="60"/>procedure involves generating two calibration curves, F<E T="52">1</E> versus pitch angle and F<E T="52">2</E> versus pitch angle. To generate these two curves, F<E T="52">1</E> and F<E T="52">2</E> shall be derived using Equations 2F-1 and 2F-2, below. Table 2F-8 provides an example wind tunnel calibration data sheet, used to log the measurements needed to derive these two calibration curves.</P>

            <P>10.6.1 Calibration velocities. The tester may calibrate the probe at two nominal wind tunnel velocity settings of 18.3 m/sec and 27.4 m/sec (60 ft/sec and 90 ft/sec) and average the results of these calibrations, as described in section 10.6.16.1, in order to generate a set of calibration curves. If this option is selected, this single set of calibration curves may be used for all field applications over the entire velocity range allowed by the method. Alternatively, the tester may customize the probe calibration for a particular field test application (or for a series of applications), based on the expected average velocity(ies) at the test site(s). If this option is selected, generate each set of calibration curves by calibrating the probe at two nominal wind tunnel velocity settings, at least one of which is greater than or equal to the expected average velocity(ies) for the field application(s), and average the results as described in section 10.6.16.1. Whichever calibration option is selected, the probe calibration coefficients (F<E T="52">2</E> values) obtained at the two nominal calibration velocities shall, for the same pitch angle setting, meet the conditions specified in section 10.6.16.</P>
            <P>10.6.2 Pitch angle calibration curve (F<E T="52">1</E> versus pitch angle). The pitch angle calibration involves generating a calibration curve of calculated F<E T="52">1</E> values versus tested pitch angles, where F<E T="52">1</E> is the ratio of the pitch pressure to the velocity pressure, i.e.,</P>

            <P>10.6.4 Connect the tested probe and calibration pitot probe to their respective pressure-measuring devices. Zero the pressure-measuring devices. Inspect and leak-check all pitot lines; repair or replace, if necessary. Turn on the fan, and allow the wind tunnel air flow to stabilize at the first of the two selected nominal velocity settings.</P>
            <P>10.6.5 Position the calibration pitot tube at its measurement location (determined as outlined in section 6.11.4.3), and align the tube so that its tip is pointed directly into the flow. Ensure that the entry port surrounding the tube is properly sealed. The calibration pitot tube may either remain in the wind tunnel throughout the calibration, or be removed from the wind tunnel while measurements are taken with the probe being calibrated.</P>
            <P>10.6.6 Set up the pitch protractor plate on the tested probe's entry port to establish the pitch angle positions of the probe to within ±2°.</P>
            <P>10.6.7 Check the zero setting of each pressure-measuring device.</P>

            <P>10.6.8 Insert the tested probe into the wind tunnel and align it so that its P<E T="52">1</E> pressure port is pointed directly into the flow and is positioned within the calibration location (as defined in section 3.20). Secure the probe at the 0° pitch angle position. Ensure that the entry port surrounding the probe is properly sealed.</P>

            <P>10.6.9 Read the differential pressure from the calibration pitot tube (ΔP<E T="52">std</E>), and record its value. Read the barometric pressure to within ±2.5 mm Hg (±0.1 in. Hg) and the temperature in the wind tunnel to within 0.6 °C (1 °F). Record these values on a data form similar to Table 2F-8.</P>

            <P>10.6.10 After the tested probe's differential pressure gauges have had sufficient time to stabilize, yaw null the probe, then obtain differential pressure readings for (P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">2</E>) and (P<E T="52">4</E>-P<E T="52">5</E>). Record the yaw angle and differential pressure readings. After taking these readings, ensure that the tested probe has remained at the yaw-null position.</P>

            <P>10.6.11 Either take paired differential pressure measurements with both the calibration pitot tube and tested probe (according to sections 10.6.9 and 10.6.10) or take readings only with the tested probe (according to section 10.6.10) in 5° increments over the pitch-angle range for which the probe is to be calibrated. The calibration pitch-angle range shall be symmetric around 0° and shall exceed the largest pitch angle expected in the field by 5°. At a minimum, probes shall be calibrated over the range of −15° to + 15°. If paired calibration pitot tube and tested probe measurements are not taken at each pitch angle setting, the differential pressure from the calibration pitot tube shall be read, at a minimum, before taking the tested probe's differential pressure reading at the first pitch angle setting and after taking the tested probe's differential pressure readings at the last pitch angle setting in each replicate.<PRTPAGE P="61"/>
            </P>
            <P>10.6.12 Perform a second replicate of the procedures in sections 10.6.5 through 10.6.11 at the same nominal velocity setting.</P>
            <P>10.6.13 For each replicate, calculate the F<E T="52">1</E> and F<E T="52">2</E> values at each pitch angle. At each pitch angle, calculate the percent difference between the two F<E T="52">2</E> values using Equation 2F-3.</P>
            <GPH DEEP="29" SPAN="1">
              <GID>ER14MY99.051</GID>
            </GPH>

            <P>If the percent difference is less than or equal to 2 percent, calculate an average F<E T="52">1</E> value and an average F<E T="52">2</E> value at that pitch angle. If the percent difference is greater than 2 percent and less than or equal to 5 percent, perform a third repetition at that angle and calculate an average F<E T="52">1</E> value and an average F<E T="52">2</E> value using all three repetitions. If the percent difference is greater than 5 percent, perform four additional repetitions at that angle and calculate an average F<E T="52">1</E> value and an average F<E T="52">2</E> value using all six repetitions. When additional repetitions are required at any pitch angle, move the probe by at least 5° and then return to the specified pitch angle before taking the next measurement. Record the average values on a form similar to Table 2F-9.</P>
            <P>10.6.14 Repeat the calibration procedures in sections 10.6.5 through 10.6.13 at the second selected nominal wind tunnel velocity setting.</P>

            <P>10.6.15 Velocity drift check. The following check shall be performed, except when paired calibration pitot tube and tested probe pressure measurements are taken at each pitch angle setting. At each velocity setting, calculate the percent difference between consecutive differential pressure measurements made with the calibration pitot tube. If a measurement differs from the previous measurement by more than 2 percent or 0.25 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.01 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), whichever is less restrictive, the calibration data collected between these calibration pitot tube measurements may not be used, and the measurements shall be repeated.</P>
            <P>10.6.16 Compare the averaged F<E T="52">2</E> coefficients obtained from the calibrations at the two selected nominal velocities, as follows. At each pitch angle setting, use Equation 2F-3 to calculate the difference between the corresponding average F<E T="52">2</E> values at the two calibration velocities. At each pitch angle in the −15° to + 15° range, the percent difference between the average F<E T="52">2</E> values shall not exceed 3.0 percent. For pitch angles outside this range (i.e., less than −15°0 and greater than + 15°), the percent difference shall not exceed 5.0 percent.</P>

            <P>10.6.16.1 If the applicable specification in section 10.6.16 is met at each pitch angle setting, average the results obtained at the two nominal calibration velocities to produce a calibration record of F<E T="52">1</E> and F<E T="52">2</E> at each pitch angle tested. Record these values on a form similar to Table 2F-9. From these values, generate one calibration curve representing F<E T="52">1</E> versus pitch angle and a second curve representing F<E T="52">2</E> versus pitch angle. Computer spreadsheet programs may be used to graph the calibration data and to develop polynomial equations that can be used to calculate pitch angles and axial velocities.</P>

            <P>10.6.16.2 If the applicable specification in section 10.6.16 is exceeded at any pitch angle setting, the probe shall not be used unless: (1) the calibration is repeated at that pitch angle and acceptable results are obtained or (2) values of F<E T="52">1</E> and F<E T="52">2</E> are obtained at two nominal velocities for which the specifications in section 10.6.16 are met across the entire pitch angle range.</P>
            <P>10.7 Recalibration. Recalibrate the probe using the procedures in section 10 either within 12 months of its first field use after its most recent calibration or after 10 field tests (as defined in section 3.4), whichever occurs later. In addition, whenever there is visible damage to the 3-D head, the probe shall be recalibrated before it is used again.</P>
            <P>10.8 Calibration of pressure-measuring devices used in field tests. Before its initial use in a field test, calibrate each pressure-measuring device (except those used exclusively for yaw nulling) using the three-point calibration procedure described in section 10.3.3. The device shall be recalibrated according to the procedure in section 10.3.3 no later than 90 days after its first field use following its most recent calibration. At the discretion of the tester, more frequent calibrations (e.g., after a field test) may be performed. No adjustments, other than adjustments to the zero setting, shall be made to the device between calibrations.</P>
            <P>10.8.1 Post-test calibration check. A single-point calibration check shall be performed on each pressure-measuring device after completion of each field test. At the discretion of the tester, more frequent single-point calibration checks (e.g., after one or more field test runs) may be performed. It is recommended that the post-test check be performed before leaving the field test site. The check shall be performed at a pressure between 50 and 90 percent of full scale by taking a common pressure reading with the tested device and a reference pressure-measuring device (as described in section 6.4.4) or by challenging the tested device with a reference pressure source (as described in section 6.4.4) or by performing an equivalent check using a reference device approved by the Administrator.</P>

            <P>10.8.2 Acceptance criterion. At the selected pressure setting, the pressure readings made using the reference device and the tested device shall agree to within 3 percent of full scale of the tested device or 0.8 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.03 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), whichever is less restrictive. If this <PRTPAGE P="62"/>specification is met, the test data collected during the field test are valid. If the specification is not met, all test data collected since the last successful calibration or calibration check are invalid and shall be repeated using a pressure-measuring device with a current, valid calibration. Any device that fails the calibration check shall not be used in a field test until a successful recalibration is performed according to the procedures in section 10.3.3.</P>
            <P>10.9 Temperature Gauges. Same as Method 2, section 4.3. The alternative thermocouple calibration procedures outlined in Emission Measurement Center (EMC) Approved Alternative Method (ALT-011) “Alternative Method 2 Thermocouple Calibration Procedure” may be performed. Temperature gauges shall be calibrated no more than 30 days prior to the start of a field test or series of field tests and recalibrated no more than 30 days after completion of a field test or series of field tests.</P>
            <P>10.10 Barometer. Same as Method 2, section 4.4. The barometer shall be calibrated no more than 30 days prior to the start of a field test or series of field tests.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">18.0 Annexes</HD>

            <P>Annex A, C, and D describe recommended procedures for meeting certain provisions in sections 8.3, 10.4, and 10.5 of this method. Annex B describes procedures to be followed <PRTPAGE P="66"/>when using the protractor wheel and pointer assembly to measure yaw angles, as provided under section 8.9.1.</P>

            <P>18.1 Annex A—Rotational Position Check. The following are recommended procedures that may be used to satisfy the rotational position check requirements of section 8.3 of this method and to determine the angle-measuring device rotational offset R<E T="52">ADO</E>.</P>
            <P>18.1.1 Rotational position check with probe outside stack. Where physical constraints at the sampling location allow full assembly of the probe outside the stack and insertion into the test port, the following procedures should be performed before the start of testing. Two angle-measuring devices that meet the specifications in section 6.2.1 or 6.2.3 are required for the rotational position check. An angle measuring device whose position can be independently adjusted (e.g., by means of a set screw) after being locked into position on the probe sheath shall not be used for this check unless the independent adjustment is set so that the device performs exactly like a device without the capability for independent adjustment. That is, when aligned on the probe such a device must give the same reading as a device that does not have the capability of being independently adjusted. With the fully assembled probe (including probe shaft extensions, if any) secured in a horizontal position, affix one yaw angle-measuring device to the probe sheath and lock it into position on the reference scribe line specified in section 6.1.6.1. Position the second angle-measuring device using the procedure in section 18.1.1.1 or 18.1.1.2.</P>
            <P>18.1.1.1 Marking procedure. The procedures in this section should be performed at each location on the fully assembled probe where the yaw angle-measuring device will be mounted during the velocity traverse. Place the second yaw angle-measuring device on the main probe sheath (or extension) at the position where a yaw angle will be measured during the velocity traverse. Adjust the position of the second angle-measuring device until it indicates the same angle (±1°) as the reference device, and affix the second device to the probe sheath (or extension). Record the angles indicated by the two angle-measuring devices on a form similar to Table 2F-2. In this position, the second angle-measuring device is considered to be properly positioned for yaw angle measurement. Make a mark, no wider than 1.6 mm (1/16 in.), on the probe sheath (or extension), such that the yaw angle-measuring device can be re-affixed at this same properly aligned position during the velocity traverse.</P>
            <P>18.1.1.2 Procedure for probe extensions with scribe lines. If, during a velocity traverse the angle-measuring device will be affixed to a probe extension having a scribe line as specified in section 6.1.6.2, the following procedure may be used to align the extension's scribe line with the reference scribe line instead of marking the extension as described in section 18.1.1.1. Attach the probe extension to the main probe. Align and lock the second angle-measuring device on the probe extension's scribe line. Then, rotate the extension until both measuring devices indicate the same angle (±1°). Lock the extension at this rotational position. Record the angles indicated by the two angle-measuring devices on a form similar to Table 2F-2. An angle-measuring device may be aligned at any position on this scribe line during the velocity traverse, if the scribe line meets the alignment specification in section 6.1.6.3.</P>
            <P>18.1.1.3 Post-test rotational position check. If the fully assembled probe includes one or more extensions, the following check should be performed immediately after the completion of a velocity traverse. At the discretion of the tester, additional checks may be conducted after completion of testing at any sample port. Without altering the alignment of any of the components of the probe assembly used in the velocity traverse, secure the fully assembled probe in a horizontal position. Affix an angle-measuring device at the reference scribe line specified in section 6.1.6.1. Use the other angle-measuring device to check the angle at each location where the device was checked prior to testing. Record the readings from the two angle-measuring devices.</P>
            <P>18.1.2 Rotational position check with probe in stack. This section applies only to probes that, due to physical constraints, cannot be inserted into the test port as fully assembled with all necessary extensions needed to reach the inner-most traverse point(s).</P>
            <P>18.1.2.1 Perform the out-of-stack procedure in section 18.1.1 on the main probe and any attached extensions that will be initially inserted into the test port.</P>
            <P>18.1.2.2 Use the following procedures to perform additional rotational position check(s) with the probe in the stack, each time a probe extension is added. Two angle-measuring devices are required. The first of these is the device that was used to measure yaw angles at the preceding traverse point, left in its properly aligned measurement position. The second angle-measuring device is positioned on the added probe extension. Use the applicable procedures in section 18.1.1.1 or 18.1.1.2 to align, adjust, lock, and mark (if necessary) the position of the second angle-measuring device to within ±1° of the first device. Record the readings of the two devices on a form similar to Table 2F-2.</P>

            <P>18.1.2.3 The procedure in section 18.1.2.2 should be performed at the first port where measurements are taken. The procedure should be repeated each time a probe extension is re-attached at a subsequent port, unless the probe extensions are designed to be locked into a mechanically fixed rotational position (e.g., through use of interlocking <PRTPAGE P="67"/>grooves), which can be reproduced from port to port as specified in section 8.3.5.2.</P>
            <P>18.2 Annex B—Angle Measurement Protocol for Protractor Wheel and Pointer Device. The following procedure shall be used when a protractor wheel and pointer assembly, such as the one described in section 6.2.2 and illustrated in Figure 2F-7 is used to measure the yaw angle of flow. With each move to a new traverse point, unlock, re-align, and re-lock the probe, angle-pointer collar, and protractor wheel to each other. At each such move, particular attention is required to ensure that the scribe line on the angle pointer collar is either aligned with the reference scribe line on the main probe sheath or is at the rotational offset position established under section 8.3.1. The procedure consists of the following steps:</P>
            <P>18.2.1 Affix a protractor wheel to the entry port for the test probe in the stack or duct.</P>
            <P>18.2.2 Orient the protractor wheel so that the 0° mark corresponds to the longitudinal axis of the stack or duct. For stacks, vertical ducts, or ports on the side of horizontal ducts, use a digital inclinometer meeting the specifications in section 6.2.1 to locate the 0° orientation. For ports on the top or bottom of horizontal ducts, identify the longitudinal axis at each test port and permanently mark the duct to indicate the 0° orientation. Once the protractor wheel is properly aligned, lock it into position on the test port.</P>
            <P>18.2.3 Move the pointer assembly along the probe sheath to the position needed to take measurements at the first traverse point. Align the scribe line on the pointer collar with the reference scribe line or at the rotational offset position established under section 8.3.1. Maintaining this rotational alignment, lock the pointer device onto the probe sheath. Insert the probe into the entry port to the depth needed to take measurements at the first traverse point.</P>
            <P>18.2.4 Perform the yaw angle determination as specified in sections 8.9.3 and 8.9.4 and record the angle as shown by the pointer on the protractor wheel. Then, take velocity pressure and temperature measurements in accordance with the procedure in section 8.9.5. Perform the alignment check described in section 8.9.6.</P>
            <P>18.2.5 After taking velocity pressure measurements at that traverse point, unlock the probe from the collar and slide the probe through the collar to the depth needed to reach the next traverse point.</P>
            <P>18.2.6 Align the scribe line on the pointer collar with the reference scribe line on the main probe or at the rotational offset position established under section 8.3.1. Lock the collar onto the probe.</P>
            <P>18.2.7 Repeat the steps in sections 18.2.4 through 18.2.6 at the remaining traverse points accessed from the current stack or duct entry port.</P>
            <P>18.2.8 After completing the measurement at the last traverse point accessed from a port, verify that the orientation of the protractor wheel on the test port has not changed over the course of the traverse at that port. For stacks, vertical ducts, or ports on the side of horizontal ducts, use a digital inclinometer meeting the specifications in section 6.2.1 to check the rotational position of the 0° mark on the protractor wheel. For ports on the top or bottom of horizontal ducts, observe the alignment of the angle wheel 0° mark relative to the permanent 0° mark on the duct at that test port. If these observed comparisons exceed ±2° of 0°, all angle and pressure measurements taken at that port since the protractor wheel was last locked into position on the port shall be repeated.</P>
            <P>18.2.9 Move to the next stack or duct entry port and repeat the steps in sections 18.2.1 through 18.2.8.</P>
            <P>18.3 Annex C—Guideline for Reference Scribe Line Placement. Use of the following guideline is recommended to satisfy the requirements of section 10.4 of this method. The rotational position of the reference scribe line should be either 90° or 180° from the probe's impact pressure port.</P>

            <P>18.4 Annex D—Determination of Reference Scribe Line Rotational Offset. The following procedures are recommended for determining the magnitude and sign of a probe's reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>. Separate procedures are provided for two types of angle-measuring devices: digital inclinometers and protractor wheel and pointer assemblies.</P>
            <P>18.4.1 Perform the following procedures on the main probe with all devices that will be attached to the main probe in the field [such as thermocouples or resistance temperature detectors (RTDs)] that may affect the flow around the probe head. Probe shaft extensions that do not affect flow around the probe head need not be attached during calibration.</P>
            <P>18.4.2 The procedures below assume that the wind tunnel duct used for probe calibration is horizontal and that the flow in the calibration wind tunnel is axial as determined by the axial flow verification check described in section 10.1.2. Angle-measuring devices are assumed to display angles in alternating 0° to 90° and 90° to 0° intervals. If angle-measuring devices with other readout conventions are used or if other calibration wind tunnel duct configurations are used, make the appropriate calculational corrections.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.1 Position the angle-measuring device in accordance with one of the following procedures.</P>

            <P>18.4.2.1.1 If using a digital inclinometer, affix the calibrated digital inclinometer to the probe. If the digital inclinometer can be independently adjusted after being locked <PRTPAGE P="68"/>into position on the probe sheath (e.g., by means of a set screw), the independent adjustment must be set so that the device performs exactly like a device without the capability for independent adjustment. That is, when aligned on the probe the device must give the same readings as a device that does not have the capability of being independently adjusted. Either align it directly on the reference scribe line or on a mark aligned with the scribe line determined according to the procedures in section 18.1.1.1. Maintaining this rotational alignment, lock the digital inclinometer onto the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.1.2 If using a protractor wheel and pointer device, orient the protractor wheel on the test port so that the 0° mark is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the wind tunnel duct. Maintaining this alignment, lock the wheel into place on the wind tunnel test port. Align the scribe line on the pointer collar with the reference scribe line or with a mark aligned with the reference scribe line, as determined under section 18.1.1.1. Maintaining this rotational alignment, lock the pointer device onto the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.2 Zero the pressure-measuring device used for yaw nulling.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.3 Insert the probe assembly into the wind tunnel through the entry port, positioning the probe's impact port at the calibration location. Check the responsiveness of the pressure-measuring device to probe rotation, taking corrective action if the response is unacceptable.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.4 Ensure that the probe is in a horizontal position using a carpenter's level.</P>

            <P>18.4.2.5 Rotate the probe either clockwise or counterclockwise until a yaw null (P<E T="52">2</E> = P<E T="52">3</E>) is obtained.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.6 Read and record the value of θ<E T="52">null</E>, the angle indicated by the angle-measuring device at the yaw-null position. Record the angle reading on a form similar to Table 2F-6. Do not associate an algebraic sign with this reading.</P>

            <P>18.4.2.7 Determine the magnitude and algebraic sign of the reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>. The magnitude of R<E T="52">SLO</E> will be equal to either θ<E T="52">null</E> or (90°−θ<E T="52">null</E>), depending on the angle-measuring device used. (See Table 2F-7 for a summary.) The algebraic sign of R<E T="52">SLO</E> will either be positive, if the rotational position of the reference scribe line is clockwise, or negative, if counterclockwise with respect to the probe's yaw-null position. Figure 2F-13 illustrates how the magnitude and sign of R<E T="52">SLO</E> are determined.</P>

            <P>18.4.2.8 Perform the steps in sections 18.4.2.3 through 18.4.2.7 twice at each of the two calibration velocities selected for the probe under section 10.6. Record the values of R<E T="52">SLO</E> in a form similar to Table 2F-6.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.9 The average of all R<E T="52">SLO</E> values is the reference scribe line rotational offset for the probe.</P>

            <P>The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.</P>
            <P>Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.</P>
            <P>Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.</P>
            <P>The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.</P>
            <P>Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.</P>

            <P>Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.<PRTPAGE P="89"/>

            <P>1.1 This method is applicable for the determination of yaw angle, near-axial velocity, and the volumetric flow rate of a gas stream in a stack or duct using a two-dimensional (2-D) probe.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <FP>2.1 A 2-D probe is used to measure the velocity pressure and the yaw angle of the flow velocity vector in a stack or duct. Alternatively, these measurements may be made by operating one of the three-dimensional (3-D) probes described in Method 2F, in yaw determination mode only. From these measurements and a determination of the stack gas density, the average near-axial velocity of the stack gas is calculated. The near-axial velocity accounts for the yaw, but not the pitch, component of flow. The average gas volumetric flow rate in the stack or duct is then determined from the average near-axial velocity.</FP>

The yaw angle is the angle described by this yaw component of flow and the vertical axis of the stack. The algebraic sign convention is illustrated in Figure 2G-2.</P>
            <P>3.24 <E T="03">Yaw Nulling.</E> A procedure in which a Type-S pitot tube or a 3-D probe is rotated about its axis in a stack or duct until a zero differential pressure reading (“yaw null”) is obtained. When a Type S probe is yaw-nulled, the rotational position of its impact port is 90° from the direction of flow in the stack or duct and the ΔP reading is zero. When a 3-D probe is yaw-nulled, its impact pressure port (P<E T="52">1</E>) faces directly into the direction of flow in the stack or duct and the differential pressure between pressure ports P<E T="52">2</E> and P<E T="52">3</E> is zero.</P>

            <P>5.1 This test method may involve hazardous operations and the use of hazardous materials or equipment. This method does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish and implement appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before using this test method.</P>

            <P>6.1 Two-dimensional Probes. Probes that provide both the velocity pressure and the yaw angle of the flow vector in a stack or duct, as listed in sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2, qualify for use based on comprehensive wind tunnel and field studies involving both inter-and intra-probe comparisons by multiple test teams. Each 2-D probe shall have a unique identification number or code permanently marked on the main probe sheath. Each probe shall be calibrated prior to use according to the procedures in section 10. Manufacturer-supplied calibration data shall be used as example information only, except when the manufacturer calibrates the probe as specified in section 10 and provides complete documentation.</P>

            <P>6.1.1 Type S (Stausscheibe or reverse type) pitot tube. This is the same as specified in Method 2, section 2.1, except for the following additional specifications that enable the pitot tube to accurately determine the yaw component of flow. For the purposes of this method, the external diameter of the tubing used to construct the Type S pitot tube (dimension D<E T="52">t</E> in Figure 2-2 of Method 2) shall be no less than 9.5 mm (3/8 in.). The pitot tube shall also meet the following alignment specifications. The angles α<E T="52">1</E>, α<E T="52">2</E>, β<E T="52">1</E>, and β<E T="52">2</E>, as shown in Method 2, Figure 2-3, shall not exceed ±2°. The dimensions <E T="03">w</E> and <E T="03">z</E>, shown in Method 2, Figure 2-3 shall not exceed 0.5 mm (0.02 in.).<PRTPAGE P="91"/>
            </P>
            <P>6.1.1.1 Manual Type S probe. This refers to a Type S probe that is positioned at individual traverse points and yaw nulled manually by an operator.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.2 Automated Type S probe. This refers to a system that uses a computer-controlled motorized mechanism to position the Type S pitot head at individual traverse points and perform yaw angle determinations.</P>

            <P>6.1.2 Three-dimensional probes used in 2-D mode. A 3-D probe, as specified in sections 6.1.1 through 6.1.3 of Method 2F, may, for the purposes of this method, be used in a two-dimensional mode (i.e., measuring yaw angle, but not pitch angle). When the 3-D probe is used as a 2-D probe, only the velocity pressure and yaw-null pressure are obtained using the pressure taps referred to as P<E T="52">1</E>, P<E T="52">2</E>, and P<E T="52">3</E>. The differential pressure P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">2</E> is a function of total velocity and corresponds to the ΔP obtained using the Type S probe. The differential pressure P<E T="52">2</E>-P<E T="52">3</E> is used to yaw null the probe and determine the yaw angle. The differential pressure P<E T="52">4</E>-P<E T="52">5</E>, which is a function of pitch angle, is not measured when the 3-D probe is used in 2-D mode.</P>
            <P>6.1.3 Other probes. [Reserved]</P>
            <P>6.1.4 Probe sheath. The probe shaft shall include an outer sheath to: (1) provide a surface for inscribing a permanent reference scribe line, (2) accommodate attachment of an angle-measuring device to the probe shaft, and (3) facilitate precise rotational movement of the probe for determining yaw angles. The sheath shall be rigidly attached to the probe assembly and shall enclose all pressure lines from the probe head to the farthest position away from the probe head where an angle-measuring device may be attached during use in the field. The sheath of the fully assembled probe shall be sufficiently rigid and straight at all rotational positions such that, when one end of the probe shaft is held in a horizontal position, the fully extended probe meets the horizontal straightness specifications indicated in section 8.2 below.</P>
            <P>6.1.5 Scribe lines.</P>
            <P>6.1.5.1 Reference scribe line. A permanent line, no greater than 1.6 mm (1/16 in.) in width, shall be inscribed on each manual probe that will be used to determine yaw angles of flow. This line shall be placed on the main probe sheath in accordance with the procedures described in section 10.4 and is used as a reference position for installation of the yaw angle-measuring device on the probe. At the discretion of the tester, the scribe line may be a single line segment placed at a particular position on the probe sheath (e.g., near the probe head), multiple line segments placed at various locations along the length of the probe sheath (e.g., at every position where a yaw angle-measuring device may be mounted), or a single continuous line extending along the full length of the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>6.1.5.2 Scribe line on probe extensions. A permanent line may also be inscribed on any probe extension that will be attached to the main probe in performing field testing. This allows a yaw angle-measuring device mounted on the extension to be readily aligned with the reference scribe line on the main probe sheath.</P>
            <P>6.1.5.3 Alignment specifications. This specification shall be met separately, using the procedures in section 10.4.1, on the main probe and on each probe extension. The rotational position of the scribe line or scribe line segments on the main probe or any probe extension must not vary by more than 2°. That is, the difference between the minimum and maximum of all of the rotational angles that are measured along the full length of the main probe or the probe extension must not exceed 2°.</P>
            <P>6.1.6 Probe and system characteristics to ensure horizontal stability.</P>
            <P>6.1.6.1 For manual probes, it is recommended that the effective length of the probe (coupled with a probe extension, if necessary) be at least 0.9 m (3 ft.) longer than the farthest traverse point mark on the probe shaft away from the probe head. The operator should maintain the probe's horizontal stability when it is fully inserted into the stack or duct. If a shorter probe is used, the probe should be inserted through a bushing sleeve, similar to the one shown in Figure 2G-3, that is installed on the test port; such a bushing shall fit snugly around the probe and be secured to the stack or duct entry port in such a manner as to maintain the probe's horizontal stability when fully inserted into the stack or duct.</P>
            <P>6.1.6.2 An automated system that includes an external probe casing with a transport system shall have a mechanism for maintaining horizontal stability comparable to that obtained by manual probes following the provisions of this method. The automated probe assembly shall also be constructed to maintain the alignment and position of the pressure ports during sampling at each traverse point. The design of the probe casing and transport system shall allow the probe to be removed from the stack or duct and checked through direct physical measurement for angular position and insertion depth.</P>
            <P>6.1.7 The tubing that is used to connect the probe and the pressure-measuring device should have an inside diameter of at least 3.2 mm (<FR>1/8</FR> in.), to reduce the time required for pressure equilibration, and should be as short as practicable.</P>

            <P>6.1.8 If a detachable probe head without a sheath [e.g., a pitot tube, typically 15.2 to 30.5 cm (6 to 12 in.) in length] is coupled with a probe sheath and calibrated in a wind tunnel in accordance with the yaw angle calibration procedure in section 10.5, the probe head shall remain attached to the probe <PRTPAGE P="92"/>sheath during field testing in the same configuration and orientation as calibrated. Once the detachable probe head is uncoupled or re-oriented, the yaw angle calibration of the probe is no longer valid and must be repeated before using the probe in subsequent field tests.</P>
            <P>6.2 Yaw Angle-measuring Device. One of the following devices shall be used for measurement of the yaw angle of flow.</P>
            <P>6.2.1 Digital inclinometer. This refers to a digital device capable of measuring and displaying the rotational position of the probe to within ±1°. The device shall be able to be locked into position on the probe sheath or probe extension, so that it indicates the probe's rotational position throughout the test. A rotational position collar block that can be attached to the probe sheath (similar to the collar shown in Figure 2G-4) may be required to lock the digital inclinometer into position on the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>6.2.2 Protractor wheel and pointer assembly. This apparatus, similar to that shown in Figure 2G-5, consists of the following components.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.1 A protractor wheel that can be attached to a port opening and set in a fixed rotational position to indicate the yaw angle position of the probe's scribe line relative to the longitudinal axis of the stack or duct. The protractor wheel must have a measurement ring on its face that is no less than 17.8 cm (7 in.) in diameter, shall be able to be rotated to any angle and then locked into position on the stack or duct test port, and shall indicate angles to a resolution of 1°.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.2 A pointer assembly that includes an indicator needle mounted on a collar that can slide over the probe sheath and be locked into a fixed rotational position on the probe sheath. The pointer needle shall be of sufficient length, rigidity, and sharpness to allow the tester to determine the probe's angular position to within 1° from the markings on the protractor wheel. Corresponding to the position of the pointer, the collar must have a scribe line to be used in aligning the pointer with the scribe line on the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>6.2.3 Other yaw angle-measuring devices. Other angle-measuring devices with a manufacturer's specified precision of 1° or better may be used, if approved by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.3 Probe Supports and Stabilization Devices. When probes are used for determining flow angles, the probe head should be kept in a stable horizontal position. For probes longer than 3.0 m (10 ft.), the section of the probe that extends outside the test port shall be secured. Three alternative devices are suggested for maintaining the horizontal position and stability of the probe shaft during flow angle determinations and velocity pressure measurements: (1) monorails installed above each port, (2) probe stands on which the probe shaft may be rested, or (3) bushing sleeves of sufficient length secured to the test ports to maintain probes in a horizontal position. Comparable provisions shall be made to ensure that automated systems maintain the horizontal position of the probe in the stack or duct. The physical characteristics of each test platform may dictate the most suitable type of stabilization device. Thus, the choice of a specific stabilization device is left to the judgement of the testers.</P>

            <P>6.4 Differential Pressure Gauges. The velocity pressure (ΔP) measuring devices used during wind tunnel calibrations and field testing shall be either electronic manometers (e.g., pressure transducers), fluid manometers, or mechanical pressure gauges (e.g., Magnehelic<E T="51">Δ</E> gauges). Use of electronic manometers is recommended. Under low velocity conditions, use of electronic manometers may be necessary to obtain acceptable measurements.</P>
            <P>6.4.1 Differential pressure-measuring device. This refers to a device capable of measuring pressure differentials and having a readability of ±1 percent of full scale. The device shall be capable of accurately measuring the maximum expected pressure differential. Such devices are used to determine the following pressure measurements: velocity pressure, static pressure, and yaw-null pressure. For an inclined-vertical manometer, the readability specification of ±1 percent shall be met separately using the respective full-scale upper limits of the inclined anvertical portions of the scales. To the extent practicable, the device shall be selected such that most of the pressure readings are between 10 and 90 percent of the device's full-scale measurement range (as defined in section 3.4). In addition, pressure-measuring devices should be selected such that the zero does not drift by more than 5 percent of the average expected pressure readings to be encountered during the field test. This is particularly important under low pressure conditions.</P>

            <P>6.4.2 Gauge used for yaw nulling. The differential pressure-measuring device chosen for yaw nulling the probe during the wind tunnel calibrations and field testing shall be bi-directional, i.e., capable of reading both positive and negative differential pressures. If a mechanical, bi-directional pressure gauge is chosen, it shall have a full-scale range no greater than 2.6 cm (i.e., −1.3 to + 1.3 cm) [1 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O (i.e., −0.5 in. to + 0.5 in.)].</P>

            <P>6.4.3 Devices for calibrating differential pressure-measuring devices. A precision manometer (e.g., a U-tube, inclined, or inclined-vertical manometer, or micromanometer) or NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable pressure source shall be used for calibrating differential pressure-measuring devices. The device shall be maintained under laboratory conditions or in a similar protected environment (e.g., a climate-controlled trailer). It shall not be used <PRTPAGE P="93"/>in field tests. The precision manometer shall have a scale gradation of 0.3 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.01 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), or less, in the range of 0 to 5.1 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0 to 2 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) and 2.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.1 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), or less, in the range of 5.1 to 25.4 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (2 to 10 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O). The manometer shall have manufacturer's documentation that it meets an accuracy specification of at least 0.5 percent of full scale. The NIST-traceable pressure source shall be recertified annually.</P>
            <P>6.4.4 Devices used for post-test calibration check. A precision manometer meeting the specifications in section 6.4.3, a pressure-measuring device or pressure source with a documented calibration traceable to NIST, or an equivalent device approved by the Administrator shall be used for the post-test calibration check. The pressure-measuring device shall have a readability equivalent to or greater than the tested device. The pressure source shall be capable of generating pressures between 50 and 90 percent of the range of the tested device and known to within ±1 percent of the full scale of the tested device. The pressure source shall be recertified annually.</P>
            <P>6.5 Data Display and Capture Devices. Electronic manometers (if used) shall be coupled with a data display device (such as a digital panel meter, personal computer display, or strip chart) that allows the tester to observe and validate the pressure measurements taken during testing. They shall also be connected to a data recorder (such as a data logger or a personal computer with data capture software) that has the ability to compute and retain the appropriate average value at each traverse point, identified by collection time and traverse point.</P>
            <P>6.6 Temperature Gauges. For field tests, a thermocouple or resistance temperature detector (RTD) capable of measuring temperature to within ±3 °C (±5 °F) of the stack or duct temperature shall be used. The thermocouple shall be attached to the probe such that the sensor tip does not touch any metal. The position of the thermocouple relative to the pressure port face openings shall be in the same configuration as used for the probe calibrations in the wind tunnel. Temperature gauges used for wind tunnel calibrations shall be capable of measuring temperature to within ±0.6 °C (±1 °F) of the temperature of the flowing gas stream in the wind tunnel.</P>

            <P>6.7 Stack or Duct Static Pressure Measurement. The pressure-measuring device used with the probe shall be as specified in section 6.4 of this method. The static tap of a standard (Prandtl type) pitot tube or one leg of a Type S pitot tube with the face opening planes positioned parallel to the gas flow may be used for this measurement. Also acceptable is the pressure differential reading of P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">bar</E> from a five-hole prism-shaped 3-D probe, as specified in section 6.1.1 of Method 2F (such as the Type DA or DAT probe), with the P<E T="52">1</E> pressure port face opening positioned parallel to the gas flow in the same manner as the Type S probe. However, the 3-D spherical probe, as specified in section 6.1.2 of Method 2F, is unable to provide this measurement and shall not be used to take static pressure measurements. Static pressure measurement is further described in section 8.11.</P>
            <P>6.8 Barometer. Same as Method 2, section 2.5.</P>
            <P>6.9 Gas Density Determination Equipment. Method 3 or 3A shall be used to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack or duct gas. Method 4 shall be used for moisture content determination and computation of stack or duct gas wet molecular weight. Other methods may be used, if approved by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.10 Calibration Pitot Tube. Same as Method 2, section 2.7.</P>
            <P>6.11 Wind Tunnel for Probe Calibration. Wind tunnels used to calibrate velocity probes must meet the following design specifications.</P>
            <P>6.11.1 Test section cross-sectional area. The flowing gas stream shall be confined within a circular, rectangular, or elliptical duct. The cross-sectional area of the tunnel must be large enough to ensure fully developed flow in the presence of both the calibration pitot tube and the tested probe. The calibration site, or “test section,” of the wind tunnel shall have a minimum diameter of 30.5 cm (12 in.) for circular or elliptical duct cross-sections or a minimum width of 30.5 cm (12 in.) on the shorter side for rectangular cross-sections. Wind tunnels shall meet the probe blockage provisions of this section and the qualification requirements prescribed in section 10.1. The projected area of the portion of the probe head, shaft, and attached devices inside the wind tunnel during calibration shall represent no more than 2 percent of the cross-sectional area of the tunnel. If the pitot and/or probe assembly blocks more than 2 percent of the cross-sectional area at an insertion point only 4 inches inside the wind tunnel, the diameter of the wind tunnel must be increased.</P>
            <P>6.11.2 Velocity range and stability. The wind tunnel should be capable of achieving and maintaining a constant and steady velocity between 6.1 m/sec and 30.5 m/sec (20 ft/sec and 100 ft/sec) for the entire calibration period for each selected calibration velocity. The wind tunnel shall produce fully developed flow patterns that are stable and parallel to the axis of the duct in the test section.</P>

            <P>6.11.3 Flow profile at the calibration location. The wind tunnel shall provide axial flow within the test section calibration location (as defined in section 3.21). Yaw and pitch angles in the calibration location shall be within ±3° of 0°. The procedure for determining that this requirement has been met is described in section 10.1.2.<PRTPAGE P="94"/>
            </P>
            <P>6.11.4 Entry ports in the wind tunnel test section.</P>
            <P>6.11.4.1 Port for tested probe. A port shall be constructed for the tested probe. This port shall be located to allow the head of the tested probe to be positioned within the wind tunnel calibration location (as defined in section 3.21). The tested probe shall be able to be locked into the 0° pitch angle position. To facilitate alignment of the probe during calibration, the test section should include a window constructed of a transparent material to allow the tested probe to be viewed.</P>
            <P>6.11.4.2 Port for verification of axial flow. Depending on the equipment selected to conduct the axial flow verification prescribed in section 10.1.2, a second port, located 90° from the entry port for the tested probe, may be needed to allow verification that the gas flow is parallel to the central axis of the test section. This port should be located and constructed so as to allow one of the probes described in section 10.1.2.2 to access the same test point(s) that are accessible from the port described in section 6.11.4.1.</P>
            <P>6.11.4.3 Port for calibration pitot tube. The calibration pitot tube shall be used in the port for the tested probe or in a separate entry port. In either case, all measurements with the calibration pitot tube shall be made at the same point within the wind tunnel over the course of a probe calibration. The measurement point for the calibration pitot tube shall meet the same specifications for distance from the wall and for axial flow as described in section 3.21 for the wind tunnel calibration location.</P>

            <P>8.1 Equipment Inspection and Set Up</P>
            <P>8.1.1 All 2-D and 3-D probes, differential pressure-measuring devices, yaw angle-measuring devices, thermocouples, and barometers shall have a current, valid calibration before being used in a field test. (See sections 10.3.3, 10.3.4, and 10.5 through 10.10 for the applicable calibration requirements.)</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Before each field use of a Type S probe, perform a visual inspection to verify the physical condition of the pitot tube. Record the results of the inspection. If the face openings are noticeably misaligned or there is visible damage to the face openings, the probe shall not be used until repaired, the dimensional specifications verified (according to the procedures in section 10.2.1), and the probe recalibrated.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Before each field use of a 3-D probe, perform a visual inspection to verify the physical condition of the probe head according to the procedures in section 10.2 of Method 2F. Record the inspection results on a form similar to Table 2F-1 presented in Method 2F. If there is visible damage to the 3-D probe, the probe shall not be used until it is recalibrated.</P>
            <P>8.1.4 After verifying that the physical condition of the probe head is acceptable, set up the apparatus using lengths of flexible tubing that are as short as practicable. Surge tanks installed between the probe and pressure-measuring device may be used to dampen pressure fluctuations provided that an adequate measurement system response time (see section 8.8) is maintained.</P>
            <P>8.2 Horizontal Straightness Check. A horizontal straightness check shall be performed before the start of each field test, except as otherwise specified in this section. Secure the fully assembled probe (including the probe head and all probe shaft extensions) in a horizontal position using a stationary support at a point along the probe shaft approximating the location of the stack or duct entry port when the probe is sampling at the farthest traverse point from the stack or duct wall. The probe shall be rotated to detect bends. Use an angle-measuring device or trigonometry to determine the bend or sag between the probe head and the secured end. (See Figure 2G-6.) Probes that are bent or sag by more than 5° shall not be used. Although this check does not apply when the probe is used for a vertical traverse, care should be taken to avoid the use of bent probes when conducting vertical traverses. If the probe is constructed of a rigid steel material and consists of a main probe without probe extensions, this check need only be performed before the initial field use of the probe, when the probe is recalibrated, when a change is made to the design or material of the probe assembly, and when the probe becomes bent. With such probes, a visual inspection shall be made of the fully assembled probe before each field test to determine if a bend is visible. The probe shall be rotated to detect bends. The inspection results shall be documented in the field test report. If a bend in the probe is visible, the horizontal straightness check shall be performed before the probe is used.</P>

            <P>8.3 Rotational Position Check. Before each field test, and each time an extension is added to the probe during a field test, a rotational position check shall be performed on all manually operated probes (except as noted in section 8.3.5 below) to ensure that, throughout testing, the angle-measuring device is either: aligned to within ±1° of the rotational position of the reference scribe line; or is affixed to the probe such that the rotational offset of the device from the reference scribe line is known to within ±1°. This check shall consist of direct measurements of the rotational positions of the reference scribe line and angle-measuring device sufficient to verify that these specifications are met. Annex A in section 18 of this method gives recommended procedures for performing the rotational position check, and Table 2G-2 <PRTPAGE P="95"/>gives an example data form. Procedures other than those recommended in Annex A in section 18 may be used, provided they demonstrate whether the alignment specification is met and are explained in detail in the field test report.</P>

            <P>8.3.1 Angle-measuring device rotational offset. The tester shall maintain a record of the angle-measuring device rotational offset, R<E T="52">ADO</E>, as defined in section 3.1. Note that R<E T="52">ADO</E> is assigned a value of 0° when the angle-measuring device is aligned to within ±1° of the rotational position of the reference scribe line. The R<E T="52">ADO</E> shall be used to determine the yaw angle of flow in accordance with section 8.9.4.</P>

            <P>8.3.2 Sign of angle-measuring device rotational offset. The sign of R<E T="52">ADO</E> is positive when the angle-measuring device (as viewed from the “tail” end of the probe) is positioned in a clockwise direction from the reference scribe line and negative when the device is positioned in a counterclockwise direction from the reference scribe line.</P>

            <P>8.3.3 Angle-measuring devices that can be independently adjusted (e.g., by means of a set screw), after being locked into position on the probe sheath, may be used. However, the R<E T="52">ADO</E> must also take into account this adjustment.</P>
            <P>8.3.4 Post-test check. If probe extensions remain attached to the main probe throughout the field test, the rotational position check shall be repeated, at a minimum, at the completion of the field test to ensure that the angle-measuring device has remained within ±2° of its rotational position established prior to testing. At the discretion of the tester, additional checks may be conducted after completion of testing at any sample port or after any test run. If the ±2° specification is not met, all measurements made since the last successful rotational position check must be repeated. section 18.1.1.3 of Annex A provides an example procedure for performing the post-test check.</P>
            <P>8.3.5 Exceptions.</P>
            <P>8.3.5.1 A rotational position check need not be performed if, for measurements taken at all velocity traverse points, the yaw angle-measuring device is mounted and aligned directly on the reference scribe line specified in sections 6.1.5.1 and 6.1.5.3 and no independent adjustments, as described in section 8.3.3, are made to device's rotational position.</P>
            <P>8.3.5.2 If extensions are detached and re-attached to the probe during a field test, a rotational position check need only be performed the first time an extension is added to the probe, rather than each time the extension is re-attached, if the probe extension is designed to be locked into a mechanically fixed rotational position (e.g., through the use of interlocking grooves), that can re-establish the initial rotational position to within ±1°.</P>
            <P>8.4 Leak Checks. A pre-test leak check shall be conducted before each field test. A post-test check shall be performed at the end of the field test, but additional leak checks may be conducted after any test run or group of test runs. The post-test check may also serve as the pre-test check for the next group of test runs. If any leak check is failed, all runs since the last passed leak check are invalid. While performing the leak check procedures, also check each pressure device's responsiveness to changes in pressure.</P>

            <P>8.4.1 To perform the leak check on a Type S pitot tube, pressurize the pitot impact opening until at least 7.6 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (3 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) velocity pressure, or a pressure corresponding to approximately 75 percent of the pressure device's measurement scale, whichever is less, registers on the pressure device; then, close off the impact opening. The pressure shall remain stable (±2.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O, ±0.10 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) for at least 15 seconds. Repeat this procedure for the static pressure side, except use suction to obtain the required pressure. Other leak-check procedures may be used, if approved by the Administrator.</P>

            <P>8.4.2 To perform the leak check on a 3-D probe, pressurize the probe's impact (P<E T="52">1</E>) opening until at least 7.6 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (3 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) velocity pressure, or a pressure corresponding to approximately 75 percent of the pressure device's measurement scale, whichever is less, registers on the pressure device; then, close off the impact opening. The pressure shall remain stable (±2.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O, ±0.10 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) for at least 15 seconds. Check the P<E T="52">2</E> and P<E T="52">3</E> pressure ports in the same fashion. Other leak-check procedures may be used, if approved by the Administrator.</P>

            <P>8.5 Zeroing the Differential Pressure-measuring Device. Zero each differential pressure-measuring device, including the device used for yaw nulling, before each field test. At a minimum, check the zero after each field test. A zero check may also be performed after any test run or group of test runs. For fluid manometers and mechanical pressure gauges (e.g., Magnehelic<E T="51">Δ</E> gauges), the zero reading shall not deviate from zero by more than ±0.8 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (±0.03 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) or one minor scale division, whichever is greater, between checks. For electronic manometers, the zero reading shall not deviate from zero between checks by more than: ±0.3 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (±0.01 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), for full scales less than or equal to 5.1 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (2.0 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O); or ±0.8 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (±0.03 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), for full scales greater than 5.1 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (2.0 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O). (<E T="04">Note:</E> If negative zero drift is not directly readable, estimate the reading based on the position of the gauge oil in the manometer or of the needle on the pressure gauge.) In addition, for all pressure-measuring devices except those used exclusively for yaw nulling, the zero <PRTPAGE P="96"/>reading shall not deviate from zero by more than 5 percent of the average measured differential pressure at any distinct process condition or load level. If any zero check is failed at a specific process condition or load level, all runs conducted at that process condition or load level since the last passed zero check are invalid.</P>

            <P>8.6 Traverse Point Verification. The number and location of the traverse points shall be selected based on Method 1 guidelines. The stack or duct diameter and port nipple lengths, including any extension of the port nipples into the stack or duct, shall be verified the first time the test is performed; retain and use this information for subsequent field tests, updating it as required. Physically measure the stack or duct dimensions or use a calibrated laser device; do not use engineering drawings of the stack or duct. The probe length necessary to reach each traverse point shall be recorded to within ±6.4 mm (±<FR>1/4</FR> in.) and, for manual probes, marked on the probe sheath. In determining these lengths, the tester shall take into account both the distance that the port flange projects outside of the stack and the depth that any port nipple extends into the gas stream. The resulting point positions shall reflect the true distances from the inside wall of the stack or duct, so that when the tester aligns any of the markings with the outside face of the stack port, the probe's impact port shall be located at the appropriate distance from the inside wall for the respective Method 1 traverse point. Before beginning testing at a particular location, an out-of-stack or duct verification shall be performed on each probe that will be used to ensure that these position markings are correct. The distances measured during the verification must agree with the previously calculated distances to within ±<FR>1/4</FR> in. For manual probes, the traverse point positions shall be verified by measuring the distance of each mark from the probe's impact pressure port (the P<E T="52">1</E> port for a 3-D probe). A comparable out-of-stack test shall be performed on automated probe systems. The probe shall be extended to each of the prescribed traverse point positions. Then, the accuracy of the positioning for each traverse point shall be verified by measuring the distance between the port flange and the probe's impact pressure port.</P>
            <P>8.7 Probe Installation. Insert the probe into the test port. A solid material shall be used to seal the port.</P>
            <P>8.8 System Response Time. Determine the response time of the probe measurement system. Insert and position the “cold” probe (at ambient temperature and pressure) at any Method 1 traverse point. Read and record the probe differential pressure, temperature, and elapsed time at 15-second intervals until stable readings for both pressure and temperature are achieved. The response time is the longer of these two elapsed times. Record the response time.</P>
            <P>8.9 Sampling.</P>
            <P>8.9.1 Yaw angle measurement protocol. With manual probes, yaw angle measurements may be obtained in two alternative ways during the field test, either by using a yaw angle-measuring device (e.g., digital inclinometer) affixed to the probe, or using a protractor wheel and pointer assembly. For horizontal traversing, either approach may be used. For vertical traversing, i.e., when measuring from on top or into the bottom of a horizontal duct, only the protractor wheel and pointer assembly may be used. With automated probes, curve-fitting protocols may be used to obtain yaw-angle measurements.</P>
            <P>8.9.1.1 If a yaw angle-measuring device affixed to the probe is to be used, lock the device on the probe sheath, aligning it either on the reference scribe line or in the rotational offset position established under section 8.3.1.</P>
            <P>8.9.1.2 If a protractor wheel and pointer assembly is to be used, follow the procedures in Annex B of this method.</P>
            <P>8.9.1.3 Curve-fitting procedures. Curve-fitting routines sweep through a range of yaw angles to create curves correlating pressure to yaw position. To find the zero yaw position and the yaw angle of flow, the curve found in the stack is computationally compared to a similar curve that was previously generated under controlled conditions in a wind tunnel. A probe system that uses a curve-fitting routine for determining the yaw-null position of the probe head may be used, provided that it is verified in a wind tunnel to be able to determine the yaw angle of flow to within ±1°.</P>
            <P>8.9.1.4 Other yaw angle determination procedures. If approved by the Administrator, other procedures for determining yaw angle may be used, provided that they are verified in a wind tunnel to be able to perform the yaw angle calibration procedure as described in section 10.5.</P>

            <P>8.9.2 Sampling strategy. At each traverse point, first yaw-null the probe, as described in section 8.9.3, below. Then, with the probe oriented into the direction of flow, measure and record the yaw angle, the differential pressure and the temperature at the traverse point, after stable readings are achieved, in accordance with sections 8.9.4 and 8.9.5. At the start of testing in each port (i.e., after a probe has been inserted into the flue gas stream), allow at least the response time to elapse before beginning to take measurements at the first traverse point accessed from that port. Provided that the probe is not removed from the flue gas stream, measurements may be taken at subsequent traverse points accessed from the same test port without waiting again for the response time to elapse.<PRTPAGE P="97"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.9.3 Yaw-nulling procedure. In preparation for yaw angle determination, the probe must first be yaw nulled. After positioning the probe at the appropriate traverse point, perform the following procedures.</P>
            <P>8.9.3.1 For Type S probes, rotate the probe until a null differential pressure reading is obtained. The direction of the probe rotation shall be such that the thermocouple is located downstream of the probe pressure ports at the yaw-null position. Rotate the probe 90° back from the yaw-null position to orient the impact pressure port into the direction of flow. Read and record the angle displayed by the angle-measuring device.</P>

            <P>8.9.3.2 For 3-D probes, rotate the probe until a null differential pressure reading (the difference in pressures across the P<E T="52">2</E> and P<E T="52">3</E> pressure ports is zero, i.e., P<E T="52">2</E> = P<E T="52">3</E>) is indicated by the yaw angle pressure gauge. Read and record the angle displayed by the angle-measuring device.</P>
            <P>8.9.3.3 Sign of the measured angle. The angle displayed on the angle-measuring device is considered positive when the probe's impact pressure port (as viewed from the “tail” end of the probe) is oriented in a clockwise rotational position relative to the stack or duct axis and is considered negative when the probe's impact pressure port is oriented in a counterclockwise rotational position (see Figure 2G-7).</P>
            <P>8.9.4 Yaw angle determination. After performing the applicable yaw-nulling procedure in section 8.9.3, determine the yaw angle of flow according to one of the following procedures. Special care must be observed to take into account the signs of the recorded angle reading and all offsets.</P>

            <P>8.9.4.1 Direct-reading. If all rotational offsets are zero or if the angle-measuring device rotational offset (R<E T="52">ADO</E>) determined in section 8.3 exactly compensates for the scribe line rotational offset (R<E T="52">SLO</E>) determined in section 10.5, then the magnitude of the yaw angle is equal to the displayed angle-measuring device reading from section 8.9.3.1 or 8.9.3.2. The algebraic sign of the yaw angle is determined in accordance with section 8.9.3.3. [<E T="04">Note:</E> Under certain circumstances (e.g., testing of horizontal ducts) a 90° adjustment to the angle-measuring device readings may be necessary to obtain the correct yaw angles.]</P>
            <P>8.9.4.2 Compensation for rotational offsets during data reduction. When the angle-measuring device rotational offset does not compensate for reference scribe line rotational offset, the following procedure shall be used to determine the yaw angle:</P>
            <P>(a) Enter the reading indicated by the angle-measuring device from section 8.9.3.1 or 8.9.3.2.</P>
            <P>(b) Associate the proper algebraic sign from section 8.9.3.3 with the reading in step (a).</P>

            <P>(c) Subtract the reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>, from the reading in step (b).</P>

            <P>(d) Subtract the angle-measuring device rotational offset, R<E T="52">ADO</E>, if any, from the result obtained in step (c).</P>

            <P>(e) The final result obtained in step (d) is the yaw angle of flow.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>It may be necessary to first apply a 90° adjustment to the reading in step (a), in order to obtain the correct yaw angle.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.9.4.3 Record the yaw angle measurements on a form similar to Table 2G-3.</P>
            <P>8.9.5 Impact velocity determination. Maintain the probe rotational position established during the yaw angle determination. Then, begin recording the pressure-measuring device readings. These pressure measurements shall be taken over a sampling period of sufficiently long duration to ensure representative readings at each traverse point. If the pressure measurements are determined from visual readings of the pressure device or display, allow sufficient time to observe the pulsation in the readings to obtain a sight-weighted average, which is then recorded manually. If an automated data acquisition system (e.g., data logger, computer-based data recorder, strip chart recorder) is used to record the pressure measurements, obtain an integrated average of all pressure readings at the traverse point. Stack or duct gas temperature measurements shall be recorded, at a minimum, once at each traverse point. Record all necessary data as shown in the example field data form (Table 2G-3).</P>
            <P>8.9.6 Alignment check. For manually operated probes, after the required yaw angle and differential pressure and temperature measurements have been made at each traverse point, verify (e.g., by visual inspection) that the yaw angle-measuring device has remained in proper alignment with the reference scribe line or with the rotational offset position established in section 8.3. If, for a particular traverse point, the angle-measuring device is found to be in proper alignment, proceed to the next traverse point; otherwise, re-align the device and repeat the angle and differential pressure measurements at the traverse point. In the course of a traverse, if a mark used to properly align the angle-measuring device (e.g., as described in section 18.1.1.1) cannot be located, re-establish the alignment mark before proceeding with the traverse.</P>

            <P>8.10 Probe Plugging. Periodically check for plugging of the pressure ports by observing the responses on the pressure differential readouts. Plugging causes erratic results or sluggish responses. Rotate the probe to determine whether the readouts respond in the expected direction. If plugging is detected, correct the problem and repeat the affected measurements.<PRTPAGE P="98"/>

            <P>8.11 Static Pressure. Measure the static pressure in the stack or duct using the equipment described in section 6.7.</P>
            <P>8.11.1 If a Type S probe is used for this measurement, position the probe at or between any traverse point(s) and rotate the probe until a null differential pressure reading is obtained. Disconnect the tubing from one of the pressure ports; read and record the ΔP. For pressure devices with one-directional scales, if a deflection in the positive direction is noted with the negative side disconnected, then the static pressure is positive. Likewise, if a deflection in the positive direction is noted with the positive side disconnected, then the static pressure is negative.</P>

            <P>8.11.2 If a 3-D probe is used for this measurement, position the probe at or between any traverse point(s) and rotate the probe until a null differential pressure reading is obtained at P<E T="52">2</E>-P<E T="52">3</E>. Rotate the probe 90°. Disconnect the P<E T="52">2</E> pressure side of the probe and read the pressure P<E T="52">1</E>-P<E T="52">bar</E> and record as the static pressure. (<E T="04">Note:</E> The spherical probe, specified in section 6.1.2 of Method 2F, is unable to provide this measurement and shall not be used to take static pressure measurements.)</P>
            <P>8.12 Atmospheric Pressure. Determine the atmospheric pressure at the sampling elevation during each test run following the procedure described in section 2.5 of Method 2.</P>

            <P>8.13 Molecular Weight. Determine the stack or duct gas dry molecular weight. For combustion processes or processes that emit essentially CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, CO, and N<E T="52">2</E>, use Method 3 or 3A. For processes emitting essentially air, an analysis need not be conducted; use a dry molecular weight of 29.0. Other methods may be used, if approved by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>8.14 Moisture. Determine the moisture content of the stack gas using Method 4 or equivalent.</P>

            <P>8.15.1 2-D probe calibration coefficient. When a Type S pitot tube is used in the field, the appropriate calibration coefficient as determined in section 10.6 shall be used to perform velocity calculations. For calibrated Type S pitot tubes, the A-side coefficient shall be used when the A-side of the tube faces the flow, and the B-side coefficient shall be used when the B-side faces the flow.</P>

            <P>8.15.2 3-D calibration coefficient. When a 3-D probe is used to collect data with this method, follow the provisions for the calibration of 3-D probes in section 10.6 of Method 2F to obtain the appropriate velocity calibration coefficient (F<E T="52">2</E> as derived using Equation 2F-2 in Method 2F) corresponding to a pitch angle position of 0°.</P>
            <P>8.15.3 Calculations. Calculate the yaw-adjusted velocity at each traverse point using the equations presented in section 12.2. Calculate the test run average stack gas velocity by finding the arithmetic average of the point velocity results in accordance with sections 12.3 and 12.4, and calculate the stack gas volumetric flow rate in accordance with section 12.5 or 12.6, as applicable.</P>

            <P>9.1.1 Range of the differential pressure gauge. In accordance with the specifications in section 6.4, ensure that the proper differential pressure gauge is being used for the range of ΔP values encountered. If it is necessary to change to a more sensitive gauge, replace the gauge with a gauge calibrated according to section 10.3.3, perform the leak check described in section 8.4 and the zero check described in section 8.5, and repeat the differential pressure and temperature readings at each traverse point.</P>
            <P>9.1.2 Horizontal stability check. For horizontal traverses of a stack or duct, visually check that the probe shaft is maintained in a horizontal position prior to taking a pressure reading. Periodically, during a test run, the probe's horizontal stability should be verified by placing a carpenter's level, a digital inclinometer, or other angle-measuring device on the portion of the probe sheath that extends outside of the test port. A comparable check should be performed by automated systems.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 Calibration</HD>
            <P>10.1 Wind Tunnel Qualification Checks. To qualify for use in calibrating probes, a wind tunnel shall have the design features specified in section 6.11 and satisfy the following qualification criteria. The velocity pressure cross-check in section 10.1.1 and axial flow verification in section 10.1.2 shall be performed before the initial use of the wind tunnel and repeated immediately after any alteration occurs in the wind tunnel's configuration, fans, interior surfaces, straightening vanes, controls, or other properties that could reasonably be expected to alter the flow pattern or velocity stability in the tunnel. The owner or operator of a wind tunnel used to calibrate probes according to this method shall maintain records documenting that the wind tunnel meets the requirements of sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 and shall provide these records to the Administrator upon request.</P>

            <P>10.1.1 Velocity pressure cross-check. To verify that the wind tunnel produces the same velocity at the tested probe head as at the calibration pitot tube impact port, perform the following cross-check. Take three <PRTPAGE P="99"/>differential pressure measurements at the fixed calibration pitot tube location, using the calibration pitot tube specified in section 6.10, and take three measurements with the calibration pitot tube at the wind tunnel calibration location, as defined in section 3.21. Alternate the measurements between the two positions. Perform this procedure at the lowest and highest velocity settings at which the probes will be calibrated. Record the values on a form similar to Table 2G-4. At each velocity setting, the average velocity pressure obtained at the wind tunnel calibration location shall be within ±2 percent or 2.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.01 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), whichever is less restrictive, of the average velocity pressure obtained at the fixed calibration pitot tube location. This comparative check shall be performed at 2.5-cm (1-in.), or smaller, intervals across the full length, width, and depth (if applicable) of the wind tunnel calibration location. If the criteria are not met at every tested point, the wind tunnel calibration location must be redefined, so that acceptable results are obtained at every point. Include the results of the velocity pressure cross-check in the calibration data section of the field test report. (See section 16.1.4.)</P>
            <P>10.1.2 Axial flow verification. The following procedures shall be performed to demonstrate that there is fully developed axial flow within the wind tunnel calibration location and at the calibration pitot tube location. Two options are available to conduct this check.</P>
            <P>10.1.2.1 Using a calibrated 3-D probe. A probe that has been previously calibrated in a wind tunnel with documented axial flow (as defined in section 3.22) may be used to conduct this check. Insert the calibrated 3-D probe into the wind tunnel test section using the tested probe port. Following the procedures in sections 8.9 and 12.2 of Method 2F, determine the yaw and pitch angles at all the point(s) in the test section where the velocity pressure cross-check, as specified in section 10.1.1, is performed. This includes all the points in the calibration location and the point where the calibration pitot tube will be located. Determine the yaw and pitch angles at each point. Repeat these measurements at the highest and lowest velocities at which the probes will be calibrated. Record the values on a form similar to Table 2G-5. Each measured yaw and pitch angle shall be within ±3° of 0°. Exceeding the limits indicates unacceptable flow in the test section. Until the problem is corrected and acceptable flow is verified by repetition of this procedure, the wind tunnel shall not be used for calibration of probes. Include the results of the axial flow verification in the calibration data section of the field test report. (See section 16.1.4.)</P>

            <P>10.1.2.2 Using alternative probes. Axial flow verification may be performed using an uncalibrated prism-shaped 3-D probe (e.g., DA or DAT probe) or an uncalibrated wedge probe. (Figure 2G-8 illustrates a typical wedge probe.) This approach requires use of two ports: the tested probe port and a second port located 90° from the tested probe port. Each port shall provide access to all the points within the wind tunnel test section where the velocity pressure cross-check, as specified in section 10.1.1, is conducted. The probe setup shall include establishing a reference yaw-null position on the probe sheath to serve as the location for installing the angle-measuring device. Physical design features of the DA, DAT, and wedge probes are relied on to determine the reference position. For the DA or DAT probe, this reference position can be determined by setting a digital inclinometer on the flat facet where the P<E T="52">1</E> pressure port is located and then identifying the rotational position on the probe sheath where a second angle-measuring device would give the same angle reading. The reference position on a wedge probe shaft can be determined either geometrically or by placing a digital inclinometer on each side of the wedge and rotating the probe until equivalent readings are obtained. With the latter approach, the reference position is the rotational position on the probe sheath where an angle-measuring device would give a reading of 0°. After installation of the angle-measuring device in the reference yaw-null position on the probe sheath, determine the yaw angle from the tested port. Repeat this measurement using the 90° offset port, which provides the pitch angle of flow. Determine the yaw and pitch angles at all the point(s) in the test section where the velocity pressure cross-check, as specified in section 10.1.1, is performed. This includes all the points in the wind tunnel calibration location and the point where the calibration pitot tube will be located. Perform this check at the highest and lowest velocities at which the probes will be calibrated. Record the values on a form similar to Table 2G-5. Each measured yaw and pitch angle shall be within ±3° of 0°. Exceeding the limits indicates unacceptable flow in the test section. Until the problem is corrected and acceptable flow is verified by repetition of this procedure, the wind tunnel shall not be used for calibration of probes. Include the results in the probe calibration report.</P>
            <P>10.1.3 Wind tunnel audits.</P>

            <P>10.1.3.1 Procedure. Upon the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of a wind tunnel shall calibrate a 2-D audit probe in accordance with the procedures described in sections 10.3 through 10.6. The calibration shall be performed at two velocities that encompass the velocities typically used for this method at the facility. The resulting calibration data shall be submitted to the Agency in an audit test report. These results shall be <PRTPAGE P="100"/>compared by the Agency to reference calibrations of the audit probe at the same velocity settings obtained at two different wind tunnels.</P>
            <P>10.1.3.2 Acceptance criterion. The audited tunnel's calibration coefficient is acceptable if it is within ±3 percent of the reference calibrations obtained at each velocity setting by one (or both) of the wind tunnels. If the acceptance criterion is not met at each calibration velocity setting, the audited wind tunnel shall not be used to calibrate probes for use under this method until the problems are resolved and acceptable results are obtained upon completion of a subsequent audit.</P>
            <P>10.2 Probe Inspection.</P>

            <P>10.2.1 Type S probe. Before each calibration of a Type S probe, verify that one leg of the tube is permanently marked A, and the other, B. Carefully examine the pitot tube from the top, side, and ends. Measure the angles (α<E T="52">1</E>, α<E T="52">2</E>, β<E T="52">1</E>, and β<E T="52">2</E>) and the dimensions (w and z) illustrated in Figures 2-2 and 2-3 in Method 2. Also measure the dimension A, as shown in the diagram in Table 2G-1, and the external tubing diameter (dimension D<E T="52">t</E>, Figure 2-2b in Method 2). For the purposes of this method, D<E T="52">t</E> shall be no less than 9.5 mm (<FR>3/8</FR> in.). The base-to-opening plane distances P<E T="52">A</E> and P<E T="52">B</E> in Figure 2-3 of Method 2 shall be equal, and the dimension A in Table 2G-1 should be between 2.10D<E T="52">t</E> and 3.00D<E T="52">t</E>. Record the inspection findings and probe measurements on a form similar to Table CD2-1 of the “Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement Systems: Volume III, Stationary Source-Specific Methods” (EPA/600/R-94/038c, September 1994). For reference, this form is reproduced herein as Table 2G-1. The pitot tube shall not be used under this method if it fails to meet the specifications in this section and the alignment specifications in section 6.1.1. All Type S probes used to collect data with this method shall be calibrated according to the procedures outlined in sections 10.3 through 10.6 below. During calibration, each Type S pitot tube shall be configured in the same manner as used, or planned to be used, during the field test, including all components in the probe assembly (e.g., thermocouple, probe sheath, sampling nozzle). Probe shaft extensions that do not affect flow around the probe head need not be attached during calibration.</P>
            <P>10.2.2 3-D probe. If a 3-D probe is used to collect data with this method, perform the pre-calibration inspection according to procedures in Method 2F, section 10.2.</P>
            <P>10.3 Pre-Calibration Procedures. Prior to calibration, a scribe line shall have been placed on the probe in accordance with section 10.4. The yaw angle and velocity calibration procedures shall not begin until the pre-test requirements in sections 10.3.1 through 10.3.4 have been met.</P>
            <P>10.3.1 Perform the horizontal straightness check described in section 8.2 on the probe assembly that will be calibrated in the wind tunnel.</P>
            <P>10.3.2 Perform a leak check in accordance with section 8.4.</P>
            <P>10.3.3 Except as noted in section 10.3.3.3, calibrate all differential pressure-measuring devices to be used in the probe calibrations, using the following procedures. At a minimum, calibrate these devices on each day that probe calibrations are performed.</P>

            <P>10.3.3.1 Procedure. Before each wind tunnel use, all differential pressure-measuring devices shall be calibrated against the reference device specified in section 6.4.3 using a common pressure source. Perform the calibration at three reference pressures representing 30, 60, and 90 percent of the full-scale range of the pressure-measuring device being calibrated. For an inclined-vertical manometer, perform separate calibrations on the inclined and vertical portions of the measurement scale, considering each portion of the scale to be a separate full-scale range. [For example, for a manometer with a 0-to 2.5-cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0-to 1-in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) inclined scale and a 2.5-to 12.7-cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (1-to 5-in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) vertical scale, calibrate the inclined portion at 7.6, 15.2, and 22.9 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), and calibrate the vertical portion at 3.8, 7.6, and 11.4 cm H<E T="52">2</E>O (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O).] Alternatively, for the vertical portion of the scale, use three evenly spaced reference pressures, one of which is equal to or higher than the highest differential pressure expected in field applications.</P>

            <P>10.3.3.2 Acceptance criteria. At each pressure setting, the two pressure readings made using the reference device and the pressure-measuring device being calibrated shall agree to within ±2 percent of full scale of the device being calibrated or 0.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.02 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), whichever is less restrictive. For an inclined-vertical manometer, these requirements shall be met separately using the respective full-scale upper limits of the inclined and vertical portions of the scale. Differential pressure-measuring devices not meeting the ±2 percent of full scale or 0.5 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.02 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) calibration requirement shall not be used.</P>
            <P>10.3.3.3 Exceptions. Any precision manometer that meets the specifications for a reference device in section 6.4.3 and that is not used for field testing does not require calibration, but must be leveled and zeroed before each wind tunnel use. Any pressure device used exclusively for yaw nulling does not require calibration, but shall be checked for responsiveness to rotation of the probe prior to each wind tunnel use.</P>

            <P>10.3.4 Calibrate digital inclinometers on each day of wind tunnel or field testing <PRTPAGE P="101"/>(prior to beginning testing) using the following procedures. Calibrate the inclinometer according to the manufacturer's calibration procedures. In addition, use a triangular block (illustrated in Figure 2G-9) with a known angle θ, independently determined using a protractor or equivalent device, between two adjacent sides to verify the inclinometer readings. (<E T="04">Note:</E> If other angle-measuring devices meeting the provisions of section 6.2.3 are used in place of a digital inclinometer, comparable calibration procedures shall be performed on such devices.) Secure the triangular block in a fixed position. Place the inclinometer on one side of the block (side A) to measure the angle of inclination (R<E T="52">1</E>). Repeat this measurement on the adjacent side of the block (side B) using the inclinometer to obtain a second angle reading (R<E T="52">2</E>). The difference of the sum of the two readings from 180° (i.e., 180°-R<E T="52">1</E>-R<E T="52">2</E>) shall be within ±2° of the known angle, θ.</P>
            <P>10.4 Placement of Reference Scribe Line. Prior to the first calibration of a probe, a line shall be permanently inscribed on the main probe sheath to serve as a reference mark for determining yaw angles. Annex C in section 18 of this method gives a guideline for placement of the reference scribe line.</P>

            <P>10.4.1 This reference scribe line shall meet the specifications in sections 6.1.5.1 and 6.1.5.3 of this method. To verify that the alignment specification in section 6.1.5.3 is met, secure the probe in a horizontal position and measure the rotational angle of each scribe line and scribe line segment using an angle-measuring device that meets the specifications in section 6.2.1 or 6.2.3. For any scribe line that is longer than 30.5 cm (12 in.), check the line's rotational position at 30.5-cm (12-in.) intervals. For each line segment that is 12 in. or less in length, check the rotational position at the two endpoints of the segment. To meet the alignment specification in section 6.1.5.3, the minimum and maximum of all of the rotational angles that are measured along the full length of main probe must not differ by more than 2°. (<E T="04">Note:</E> A short reference scribe line segment [e.g., 15.2 cm (6 in.) or less in length] meeting the alignment specifications in section 6.1.5.3 is fully acceptable under this method. See section 18.1.1.1 of Annex A for an example of a probe marking procedure, suitable for use with a short reference scribe line.)</P>

            <P>10.4.2 The scribe line should be placed on the probe first and then its offset from the yaw-null position established (as specified in section 10.5). The rotational position of the reference scribe line relative to the yaw-null position of the probe, as determined by the yaw angle calibration procedure in section 10.5, is the reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>. The reference scribe line rotational offset shall be recorded and retained as part of the probe's calibration record.</P>
            <P>10.4.3 Scribe line for automated probes. A scribe line may not be necessary for an automated probe system if a reference rotational position of the probe is built into the probe system design. For such systems, a “flat” (or comparable, clearly identifiable physical characteristic) should be provided on the probe casing or flange plate to ensure that the reference position of the probe assembly remains in a vertical or horizontal position. The rotational offset of the flat (or comparable, clearly identifiable physical characteristic) needed to orient the reference position of the probe assembly shall be recorded and maintained as part of the automated probe system's specifications.</P>
            <P>10.5 Yaw Angle Calibration Procedure. For each probe used to measure yaw angles with this method, a calibration procedure shall be performed in a wind tunnel meeting the specifications in section 10.1 to determine the rotational position of the reference scribe line relative to the probe's yaw-null position. This procedure shall be performed on the main probe with all devices that will be attached to the main probe in the field [such as thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), or sampling nozzles] that may affect the flow around the probe head. Probe shaft extensions that do not affect flow around the probe head need not be attached during calibration. At a minimum, this procedure shall include the following steps.</P>
            <P>10.5.1 Align and lock the angle-measuring device on the reference scribe line. If a marking procedure (such as described in section 18.1.1.1) is used, align the angle-measuring device on a mark within ±1° of the rotational position of the reference scribe line. Lock the angle-measuring device onto the probe sheath at this position.</P>
            <P>10.5.2 Zero the pressure-measuring device used for yaw nulling.</P>
            <P>10.5.3 Insert the probe assembly into the wind tunnel through the entry port, positioning the probe's impact port at the calibration location. Check the responsiveness of the pressure-measurement device to probe rotation, taking corrective action if the response is unacceptable.</P>
            <P>10.5.4 Ensure that the probe is in a horizontal position, using a carpenter's level.</P>

            <P>10.5.5 Rotate the probe either clockwise or counterclockwise until a yaw null [zero ΔP for a Type S probe or zero (P<E T="52">2</E>-P<E T="52">3</E>) for a 3-D probe] is obtained. If using a Type S probe with an attached thermocouple, the direction of the probe rotation shall be such that the thermocouple is located downstream of the probe pressure ports at the yaw-null position.</P>

            <P>10.5.6 Use the reading displayed by the angle-measuring device at the yaw-null position to determine the magnitude of the reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>, as defined in section 3.15. Annex D in section 18 <PRTPAGE P="102"/>of this method gives a recommended procedure for determining the magnitude of R<E T="52">SLO</E> with a digital inclinometer and a second procedure for determining the magnitude of R<E T="52">SLO</E> with a protractor wheel and pointer device. Table 2G-6 gives an example data form and Table 2G-7 is a look-up table with the recommended procedure. Procedures other than those recommended in Annex D in section 18 may be used, if they can determine R<E T="52">SLO</E> to within 1° and are explained in detail in the field test report. The algebraic sign of R<E T="52">SLO</E> will either be positive if the rotational position of the reference scribe line (as viewed from the “tail” end of the probe) is clockwise, or negative, if counterclockwise with respect to the probe's yaw-null position. (This is illustrated in Figure 2G-10.)</P>

            <P>10.5.7 The steps in sections 10.5.3 through 10.5.6 shall be performed twice at each of the velocities at which the probe will be calibrated (in accordance with section 10.6). Record the values of R<E T="52">SLO</E>.</P>
            <P>10.5.8 The average of all of the R<E T="52">SLO</E> values shall be documented as the reference scribe line rotational offset for the probe.</P>
            <P>10.5.9 Use of reference scribe line offset. The reference scribe line rotational offset shall be used to determine the yaw angle of flow in accordance with section 8.9.4.</P>

            <P>10.6 Velocity Calibration Procedure. When a 3-D probe is used under this method, follow the provisions for the calibration of 3-D probes in section 10.6 of Method 2F to obtain the necessary velocity calibration coefficients (F<E T="52">2</E> as derived using Equation 2F-2 in Method 2F) corresponding to a pitch angle position of 0°. The following procedure applies to Type S probes. This procedure shall be performed on the main probe and all devices that will be attached to the main probe in the field (e.g., thermocouples, RTDs, sampling nozzles) that may affect the flow around the probe head. Probe shaft extensions that do not affect flow around the probe head need not be attached during calibration. (Note: If a sampling nozzle is part of the assembly, two additional requirements must be satisfied before proceeding. The distance between the nozzle and the pitot tube shall meet the minimum spacing requirement prescribed in Method 2, and a wind tunnel demonstration shall be performed that shows the probe's ability to yaw null is not impaired when the nozzle is drawing sample.) To obtain velocity calibration coefficient(s) for the tested probe, proceed as follows.</P>

            <P>10.6.1 Calibration velocities. The tester may calibrate the probe at two nominal wind tunnel velocity settings of 18.3 m/sec and 27.4 m/sec (60 ft/sec and 90 ft/sec) and average the results of these calibrations, as described in sections 10.6.12 through 10.6.14, in order to generate the calibration coefficient, C<E T="52">p</E>. If this option is selected, this calibration coefficient may be used for all field applications where the velocities are 9.1 m/sec (30 ft/sec) or greater. Alternatively, the tester may customize the probe calibration for a particular field test application (or for a series of applications), based on the expected average velocity(ies) at the test site(s). If this option is selected, generate the calibration coefficients by calibrating the probe at two nominal wind tunnel velocity settings, one of which is less than or equal to and the other greater than or equal to the expected average velocity(ies) for the field application(s), and average the results as described in sections 10.6.12 through 10.6.14. Whichever calibration option is selected, the probe calibration coefficient(s) obtained at the two nominal calibration velocities shall meet the conditions specified in sections 10.6.12 through 10.6.14.</P>
            <P>10.6.2 Connect the tested probe and calibration pitot tube to their respective pressure-measuring devices. Zero the pressure-measuring devices. Inspect and leak-check all pitot lines; repair or replace them, if necessary. Turn on the fan, and allow the wind tunnel air flow to stabilize at the first of the selected nominal velocity settings.</P>
            <P>10.6.3 Position the calibration pitot tube at its measurement location (determined as outlined in section 6.11.4.3), and align the tube so that its tip is pointed directly into the flow. Ensure that the entry port surrounding the tube is properly sealed. The calibration pitot tube may either remain in the wind tunnel throughout the calibration, or be removed from the wind tunnel while measurements are taken with the probe being calibrated.</P>
            <P>10.6.4 Check the zero setting of each pressure-measuring device.</P>
            <P>10.6.5 Insert the tested probe into the wind tunnel and align it so that the designated pressure port (e.g., either the A-side or B-side of a Type S probe) is pointed directly into the flow and is positioned within the wind tunnel calibration location (as defined in section 3.21). Secure the probe at the 0° pitch angle position. Ensure that the entry port surrounding the probe is properly sealed.</P>

            <P>10.6.6 Read the differential pressure from the calibration pitot tube (ΔP<E T="52">std</E>), and record its value. Read the barometric pressure to within ±2.5 mm Hg (±0.1 in. Hg) and the temperature in the wind tunnel to within 0.6 °C (1 °F). Record these values on a data form similar to Table 2G-8. Record the rotational speed of the fan or indicator of wind tunnel velocity control (damper setting, variac rheostat, etc.) and make no adjustment to fan speed or wind tunnel velocity control between this observation and the Type S probe reading.</P>

            <P>10.6.7 After the tested probe's differential pressure gauges have had sufficient time to stabilize, yaw null the probe (and then rotate it back 90° for Type S probes), then obtain the differential pressure reading (ΔP). Record <PRTPAGE P="103"/>the yaw angle and differential pressure readings.</P>

            <P>10.6.8 Take paired differential pressure measurements with the calibration pitot tube and tested probe (according to sections 10.6.6 and 10.6.7). The paired measurements in each replicate can be made either simultaneously (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> with both probes in the wind tunnel) or by alternating the measurements of the two probes (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> with only one probe at a time in the wind tunnel). Adjustments made to the fan speed or other changes to the system designed to change the air flow velocity of the wind tunnel between observation of the calibration pitot tube (ΔP<E T="52">std</E>) and the Type S pitot tube invalidates the reading and the observation must be repeated.</P>
            <P>10.6.9 Repeat the steps in sections 10.6.6 through 10.6.8 at the same nominal velocity setting until three pairs of ΔP readings have been obtained from the calibration pitot tube and the tested probe.</P>
            <P>10.6.10 Repeat the steps in sections 10.6.6 through 10.6.9 above for the A-side and B-side of the Type S pitot tube. For a probe assembly constructed such that its pitot tube is always used in the same orientation, only one side of the pitot tube need be calibrated (the side that will face the flow). However, the pitot tube must still meet the alignment and dimension specifications in section 6.1.1 and must have an average deviation (σ) value of 0.01 or less as provided in section 10.6.12.4.</P>
            <P>10.6.11 Repeat the calibration procedures in sections 10.6.6 through 10.6.10 at the second selected nominal wind tunnel velocity setting.</P>
            <P>10.6.12 Perform the following calculations separately on the A-side and B-side values.</P>
            <P>10.6.12.1 Calculate a C<E T="52">p</E> value for each of the three replicates performed at the lower velocity setting where the calibrations were performed using Equation 2-2 in section 4.1.4 of Method 2.</P>
            <P>10.6.12.2 Calculate the arithmetic average, C<E T="52">p(avg-low)</E>, of the three C<E T="52">p</E> values.</P>

            <P>10.6.12.3 Calculate the deviation of each of the three individual values of C<E T="52">p</E> from the A-side average C<E T="52">p(avg-low)</E> value using Equation 2-3 in Method 2.</P>

            <P>10.6.12.4 Calculate the average deviation (σ) of the three individual C<E T="52">p</E> values from C<E T="52">p(avg-low)</E> using Equation 2-4 in Method 2. Use the Type S pitot tube only if the values of σ (side A) and σ (side B) are less than or equal to 0.01. If both A-side and B-side calibration coefficients are calculated, the absolute value of the difference between C<E T="52">p(avg-low)</E> (side A) and C<E T="52">p(avg-low)</E> (side B) must not exceed 0.01.</P>

            <P>10.6.13 Repeat the calculations in section 10.6.12 using the data obtained at the higher velocity setting to derive the arithmetic C<E T="52">p</E> values at the higher velocity setting, C<E T="52">p(avg-high)</E>, and to determine whether the conditions in 10.6.12.4 are met by both the A-side and B-side calibrations at this velocity setting.</P>

            <P>10.6.14 Use equation 2G-1 to calculate the percent difference of the averaged C<E T="52">p</E> values at the two calibration velocities.</P>
            <GPH DEEP="33" SPAN="2">
              <GID>ER14MY99.062</GID>
            </GPH>
            <FP>The percent difference between the averaged C<E T="52">p</E> values shall not exceed ±3 percent. If the specification is met, average the A-side values of C<E T="52">p(avg-low)</E> and C<E T="52">p(avg-high)</E> to produce a single A-side calibration coefficient, C<E T="52">p</E>. Repeat for the B-side values if calibrations were performed on that side of the pitot. If the specification is not met, make necessary adjustments in the selected velocity settings and repeat the calibration procedure until acceptable results are obtained.</FP>

            <P>10.6.15 If the two nominal velocities used in the calibration were 18.3 and 27.4 m/sec (60 and 90 ft/sec), the average C<E T="52">p</E> from section 10.6.14 is applicable to all velocities 9.1 m/sec (30 ft/sec) or greater. If two other nominal velocities were used in the calibration, the resulting average C<E T="52">p</E> value shall be applicable only in situations where the velocity calculated using the calibration coefficient is neither less than the lower nominal velocity nor greater than the higher nominal velocity.</P>
            <P>10.7 Recalibration. Recalibrate the probe using the procedures in section 10 either within 12 months of its first field use after its most recent calibration or after 10 field tests (as defined in section 3.3), whichever occurs later. In addition, whenever there is visible damage to the probe head, the probe shall be recalibrated before it is used again.</P>

            <P>10.8 Calibration of pressure-measuring devices used in the field. Before its initial use in a field test, calibrate each pressure-measuring device (except those used exclusively for yaw nulling) using the three-point calibration procedure described in section 10.3.3. The device shall be recalibrated according to the procedure in section 10.3.3 no later than 90 days after its first field use following its most recent calibration. At the discretion of the tester, more frequent calibrations (e.g., <PRTPAGE P="104"/>after a field test) may be performed. No adjustments, other than adjustments to the zero setting, shall be made to the device between calibrations.</P>
            <P>10.8.1 Post-test calibration check. A single-point calibration check shall be performed on each pressure-measuring device after completion of each field test. At the discretion of the tester, more frequent single-point calibration checks (e.g., after one or more field test runs) may be performed. It is recommended that the post-test check be performed before leaving the field test site. The check shall be performed at a pressure between 50 and 90 percent of full scale by taking a common pressure reading with the tested probe and a reference pressure-measuring device (as described in section 6.4.4) or by challenging the tested device with a reference pressure source (as described in section 6.4.4) or by performing an equivalent check using a reference device approved by the Administrator.</P>

            <P>10.8.2 Acceptance criterion. At the selected pressure setting, the pressure readings made using the reference device and the tested device shall agree to within ±3 percent of full scale of the tested device or 0.8 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.03 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O), whichever is less restrictive. If this specification is met, the test data collected during the field test are valid. If the specification is not met, all test data collected since the last successful calibration or calibration check are invalid and shall be repeated using a pressure-measuring device with a current, valid calibration. Any device that fails the calibration check shall not be used in a field test until a successful recalibration is performed according to the procedures in section 10.3.3.</P>
            <P>10.9 Temperature Gauges. Same as Method 2, section 4.3. The alternative thermocouple calibration procedures outlined in Emission Measurement Center (EMC) Approved Alternative Method (ALT-011) “Alternative Method 2 Thermocouple Calibration Procedure” may be performed. Temperature gauges shall be calibrated no more than 30 days prior to the start of a field test or series of field tests and recalibrated no more than 30 days after completion of a field test or series of field tests.</P>
            <P>10.10 Barometer. Same as Method 2, section 4.4. The barometer shall be calibrated no more than 30 days prior to the start of a field test or series of field tests.</P>

            <P>Annex A, C, and D describe recommended procedures for meeting certain provisions in sections 8.3, 10.4, and 10.5 of this method. Annex B describes procedures to be followed when using the protractor wheel and pointer assembly to measure yaw angles, as provided under section 8.9.1.</P>

            <P>18.1 Annex A—Rotational Position Check. The following are recommended procedures that may be used to satisfy the rotational position check requirements of section 8.3 of this method and to determine the angle-measuring device rotational offset (R<E T="52">ADO</E>).</P>
            <P>18.1.1 Rotational position check with probe outside stack. Where physical constraints at the sampling location allow full assembly of the probe outside the stack and insertion into the test port, the following procedures should be performed before the start of testing. Two angle-measuring devices that meet the specifications in section 6.2.1 or 6.2.3 are required for the rotational position check. An angle measuring device whose position can be independently adjusted (e.g., by means of a set screw) after being locked into position on the probe sheath shall not be used for this check unless the independent adjustment is set so that the device performs exactly like a device without the capability for independent adjustment. That is, when aligned on the probe such a device must give the same reading as a device that does not have the capability of being independently adjusted. With the fully assembled probe (including probe shaft extensions, if any) secured in a horizontal position, affix one yaw angle-measuring device to the probe sheath and lock it into position on the reference scribe line specified in section 6.1.5.1. Position the second angle-measuring device using the procedure in section 18.1.1.1 or 18.1.1.2.</P>
            <P>18.1.1.1 Marking procedure. The procedures in this section should be performed at each location on the fully assembled probe where the yaw angle-measuring device will be mounted during the velocity traverse. Place the second yaw angle-measuring device on the main probe sheath (or extension) at the position where a yaw angle will be measured during the velocity traverse. Adjust the position of the second angle-measuring device until it indicates the same angle (±1°) as the reference device, and affix the second device to the probe sheath (or extension). Record the angles indicated by the two angle-measuring devices on a form similar to table 2G-2. In this position, the second angle-measuring device is considered to be properly positioned for yaw angle measurement. Make a mark, no wider than 1.6 mm (<FR>1/16</FR> in.), on the probe sheath (or extension), such that the yaw angle-measuring device can be re-affixed at this same properly aligned position during the velocity traverse.</P>
            <P>18.1.1.2 Procedure for probe extensions with scribe lines. If, during a velocity traverse the angle-measuring device will be affixed to a probe extension having a scribe line as specified in section 6.1.5.2, the following procedure may be used to align the extension's scribe line with the reference scribe line instead of marking the extension as described in section 18.1.1.1. Attach the probe extension to the main probe. Align and lock the second angle-measuring device on the probe extension's scribe line. Then, rotate the extension until both measuring devices indicate the same angle (±1°). Lock the extension at this rotational position. Record the angles indicated by the two angle-measuring devices on a form similar to table 2G-2. An angle-measuring device may be aligned at any position on this scribe line during the velocity traverse, if the scribe line meets the alignment specification in section 6.1.5.3.</P>

            <P>18.1.1.3 Post-test rotational position check. If the fully assembled probe includes one or more extensions, the following check should be performed immediately after the completion of a velocity traverse. At the discretion <PRTPAGE P="109"/>of the tester, additional checks may be conducted after completion of testing at any sample port. Without altering the alignment of any of the components of the probe assembly used in the velocity traverse, secure the fully assembled probe in a horizontal position. Affix an angle-measuring device at the reference scribe line specified in section 6.1.5.1. Use the other angle-measuring device to check the angle at each location where the device was checked prior to testing. Record the readings from the two angle-measuring devices.</P>
            <P>18.1.2 Rotational position check with probe in stack. This section applies only to probes that, due to physical constraints, cannot be inserted into the test port as fully assembled with all necessary extensions needed to reach the inner-most traverse point(s).</P>
            <P>18.1.2.1 Perform the out-of-stack procedure in section 18.1.1 on the main probe and any attached extensions that will be initially inserted into the test port.</P>
            <P>18.1.2.2 Use the following procedures to perform additional rotational position check(s) with the probe in the stack, each time a probe extension is added. Two angle-measuring devices are required. The first of these is the device that was used to measure yaw angles at the preceding traverse point, left in its properly aligned measurement position. The second angle-measuring device is positioned on the added probe extension. Use the applicable procedures in section 18.1.1.1 or 18.1.1.2 to align, adjust, lock, and mark (if necessary) the position of the second angle-measuring device to within ±1° of the first device. Record the readings of the two devices on a form similar to Table 2G-2.</P>
            <P>18.1.2.3 The procedure in section 18.1.2.2 should be performed at the first port where measurements are taken. The procedure should be repeated each time a probe extension is re-attached at a subsequent port, unless the probe extensions are designed to be locked into a mechanically fixed rotational position (e.g., through use of interlocking grooves), which can be reproduced from port to port as specified in section 8.3.5.2.</P>
            <P>18.2 Annex B—Angle Measurement Protocol for Protractor Wheel and Pointer Device. The following procedure shall be used when a protractor wheel and pointer assembly, such as the one described in section 6.2.2 and illustrated in Figure 2G-5 is used to measure the yaw angle of flow. With each move to a new traverse point, unlock, re-align, and re-lock the probe, angle-pointer collar, and protractor wheel to each other. At each such move, particular attention is required to ensure that the scribe line on the angle pointer collar is either aligned with the reference scribe line on the main probe sheath or is at the rotational offset position established under section 8.3.1. The procedure consists of the following steps:</P>
            <P>18.2.1 Affix a protractor wheel to the entry port for the test probe in the stack or duct.</P>
            <P>18.2.2 Orient the protractor wheel so that the 0° mark corresponds to the longitudinal axis of the stack or duct. For stacks, vertical ducts, or ports on the side of horizontal ducts, use a digital inclinometer meeting the specifications in section 6.2.1 to locate the 0° orientation. For ports on the top or bottom of horizontal ducts, identify the longitudinal axis at each test port and permanently mark the duct to indicate the 0° orientation. Once the protractor wheel is properly aligned, lock it into position on the test port.</P>
            <P>18.2.3 Move the pointer assembly along the probe sheath to the position needed to take measurements at the first traverse point. Align the scribe line on the pointer collar with the reference scribe line or at the rotational offset position established under section 8.3.1. Maintaining this rotational alignment, lock the pointer device onto the probe sheath. Insert the probe into the entry port to the depth needed to take measurements at the first traverse point.</P>
            <P>18.2.4 Perform the yaw angle determination as specified in sections 8.9.3 and 8.9.4 and record the angle as shown by the pointer on the protractor wheel. Then, take velocity pressure and temperature measurements in accordance with the procedure in section 8.9.5. Perform the alignment check described in section 8.9.6.</P>
            <P>18.2.5 After taking velocity pressure measurements at that traverse point, unlock the probe from the collar and slide the probe through the collar to the depth needed to reach the next traverse point.</P>
            <P>18.2.6 Align the scribe line on the pointer collar with the reference scribe line on the main probe or at the rotational offset position established under section 8.3.1. Lock the collar onto the probe.</P>
            <P>18.2.7 Repeat the steps in sections 18.2.4 through 18.2.6 at the remaining traverse points accessed from the current stack or duct entry port.</P>

            <P>18.2.8 After completing the measurement at the last traverse point accessed from a port, verify that the orientation of the protractor wheel on the test port has not changed over the course of the traverse at that port. For stacks, vertical ducts, or ports on the side of horizontal ducts, use a digital inclinometer meeting the specifications in section 6.2.1 to check the rotational position of the 0° mark on the protractor wheel. For ports on the top or bottom of horizontal ducts, observe the alignment of the angle wheel 0° mark relative to the permanent 0° mark on the duct at that test port. If these observed comparisons exceed ±2° of 0°, all angle and pressure measurements taken at that port since the protractor wheel was last locked into position on the port shall be repeated.<PRTPAGE P="110"/>
            </P>
            <P>18.2.9 Move to the next stack or duct entry port and repeat the steps in sections 18.2.1 through 18.2.8.</P>
            <P>18.3 Annex C—Guideline for Reference Scribe Line Placement. Use of the following guideline is recommended to satisfy the requirements of section 10.4 of this method. The rotational position of the reference scribe line should be either 90° or 180° from the probe's impact pressure port. For Type-S probes, place separate scribe lines, on opposite sides of the probe sheath, if both the A and B sides of the pitot tube are to be used for yaw angle measurements.</P>

            <P>18.4 Annex D—Determination of Reference Scribe Line Rotational Offset. The following procedures are recommended for determining the magnitude and sign of a probe's reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>. Separate procedures are provided for two types of angle-measuring devices: digital inclinometers and protractor wheel and pointer assemblies.</P>
            <P>18.4.1 Perform the following procedures on the main probe with all devices that will be attached to the main probe in the field [such as thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), or sampling nozzles] that may affect the flow around the probe head. Probe shaft extensions that do not affect flow around the probe head need not be attached during calibration.</P>
            <P>18.4.2 The procedures below assume that the wind tunnel duct used for probe calibration is horizontal and that the flow in the calibration wind tunnel is axial as determined by the axial flow verification check described in section 10.1.2. Angle-measuring devices are assumed to display angles in alternating 0° to 90° and 90° to 0° intervals. If angle-measuring devices with other readout conventions are used or if other calibration wind tunnel duct configurations are used, make the appropriate calculational corrections. For Type-S probes, calibrate the A-side and B-sides separately, using the appropriate scribe line (see section 18.3, above), if both the A and B sides of the pitot tube are to be used for yaw angle determinations.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.1 Position the angle-measuring device in accordance with one of the following procedures.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.1.1 If using a digital inclinometer, affix the calibrated digital inclinometer to the probe. If the digital inclinometer can be independently adjusted after being locked into position on the probe sheath (e.g., by means of a set screw), the independent adjustment must be set so that the device performs exactly like a device without the capability for independent adjustment. That is, when aligned on the probe the device must give the same readings as a device that does not have the capability of being independently adjusted. Either align it directly on the reference scribe line or on a mark aligned with the scribe line determined according to the procedures in section 18.1.1.1. Maintaining this rotational alignment, lock the digital inclinometer onto the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.1.2 If using a protractor wheel and pointer device, orient the protractor wheel on the test port so that the 0° mark is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the wind tunnel duct. Maintaining this alignment, lock the wheel into place on the wind tunnel test port. Align the scribe line on the pointer collar with the reference scribe line or with a mark aligned with the reference scribe line, as determined under section 18.1.1.1. Maintaining this rotational alignment, lock the pointer device onto the probe sheath.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.2 Zero the pressure-measuring device used for yaw nulling.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.3 Insert the probe assembly into the wind tunnel through the entry port, positioning the probe's impact port at the calibration location. Check the responsiveness of the pressure-measuring device to probe rotation, taking corrective action if the response is unacceptable.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.4 Ensure that the probe is in a horizontal position using a carpenter's level.</P>

            <P>18.4.2.5 Rotate the probe either clockwise or counterclockwise until a yaw null [zero ΔP for a Type S probe or zero (P<E T="52">2</E>-P<E T="52">3</E>) for a 3-D probe] is obtained. If using a Type S probe with an attached thermocouple, the direction of the probe rotation shall be such that the thermocouple is located downstream of the probe pressure ports at the yaw-null position.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.6 Read and record the value of θ<E T="52">null</E>, the angle indicated by the angle-measuring device at the yaw-null position. Record the angle reading on a form similar to Table 2G-6. Do not associate an algebraic sign with this reading.</P>

            <P>18.4.2.7 Determine the magnitude and algebraic sign of the reference scribe line rotational offset, R<E T="52">SLO</E>. The magnitude of R<E T="52">SLO</E> will be equal to either θ<E T="52">null</E> or (90°−θ<E T="52">null</E>), depending on the type of probe being calibrated and the type of angle-measuring device used. (See Table 2G-7 for a summary.) The algebraic sign of R<E T="52">SLO</E> will either be positive if the rotational position of the reference scribe line is clockwise or negative if counterclockwise with respect to the probe's yaw-null position. Figure 2G-10 illustrates how the magnitude and sign of R<E T="52">SLO</E> are determined.</P>

            <P>18.4.2.8 Perform the steps in sections 18.3.2.3 through 18.3.2.7 twice at each of the two calibration velocities selected for the probe under section 10.6. Record the values of R<E T="52">SLO</E> in a form similar to Table 2G-6.</P>
            <P>18.4.2.9 The average of all R<E T="52">SLO</E> values is the reference scribe line rotational offset for the probe.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <P>1.1 This method is applicable in conjunction with Methods 2, 2F, and 2G (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A) to account for velocity decay near the wall in circular stacks and ducts.</P>
            <P>1.2 This method is not applicable for testing stacks and ducts less than 3.3 ft (1.0 m) in diameter.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>2.1 A wall effects adjustment factor is determined. It is used to adjust the average stack gas velocity obtained under Method 2, 2F, or 2G of this appendix to take into account velocity decay near the stack or duct wall.</P>
            <P>2.2 The method contains two possible procedures: a calculational approach which derives an adjustment factor from velocity measurements and a default procedure which assigns a generic adjustment factor based on the construction of the stack or duct.</P>
            <P>2.2.1 The calculational procedure derives a wall effects adjustment factor from velocity measurements taken using Method 2, 2F, or 2G at 16 (or more) traverse points specified under Method 1 of this appendix and a total of eight (or more) wall effects traverse points specified under this method. The calculational procedure based on velocity measurements is not applicable for horizontal circular ducts where build-up of particulate matter or other material in the bottom of the duct is present.</P>
            <P>2.2.2 A default wall effects adjustment factor of 0.9900 for brick and mortar stacks and 0.9950 for all other types of stacks and ducts may be used without taking wall effects measurements in a stack or duct.</P>
            <P>2.3 When the calculational procedure is conducted as part of a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) or other multiple-run test procedure, the wall effects adjustment factor derived from a single traverse (i.e., single RATA run) may be applied to all runs of the same RATA without repeating the wall effects measurements. Alternatively, wall effects adjustment factors may be derived for several traverses and an average wall effects adjustment factor applied to all runs of the same RATA.</P>

            <FP>Table 2H-1 shows d<E T="54">b</E> as a function of the stack or duct radius, <E T="03">r</E>, for traverses ranging from 16 to 48 points (i.e., for values of <E T="03">p</E> ranging from 8 to 24).</FP>
            <P>(b) Each point must be located at a distance that is a whole number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) multiple of 1 in. (2.5 cm).</P>

            <P>(c) Points do not have to be located at consecutive 1-in. intervals. That is, one or more 1-in. incremented points may be skipped. For example, it would be acceptable for points to be located at 1 in. (2.5 cm), 3 in. (7.6 cm), 5 in. (12.7 cm), d<E T="54">last</E>, and d<E T="54">rem</E>; or at 1 in. (2.5 cm), 2 in.

Follow the instructions in section 8.7.1.2 of this method for recording results for wall effects traverse points that are skipped. It should be noted that the full extent of velocity decay may not be accounted for if measurements are not taken at all 1-in. incremented points close to the wall.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Complete wall effects traverse. For a complete wall effects traverse, measurements must be taken at the following points in all four Method 1 equal-area sectors closest to the wall.</P>
            <P>(a) The 1-in. incremented wall effects traverse point closest to the wall where the probe can be positioned and velocity can be detected, but no farther than 4 in. (10.2 cm) from the wall.</P>

(30.5 cm) from the wall, whichever comes first. Note: In stacks or ducts with diameters greater than 15.6 ft (4.8 m) the interior edge of the Method 1 equal-area sector is farther from the wall than 12 in. (30.5 cm).</P>

              <E T="52">rem</E>, as determined using Equation 2H-1 or 2H-2 (as applicable). Note: For a complete traverse of a stack or duct with a diameter less than 16.5 ft (5.0 m), the distance between <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E> and <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">last</E> is less than or equal to <FR>1/2</FR> in. (12.7 mm). As discussed in section 8.2.4.2, when the distance between <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E> and <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">last</E> is less than or equal to <FR>1/2</FR> in. (12.7 mm), the velocity measured at <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">last</E> may be used for <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E>. Thus, it is not necessary to calculate the distance of <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E> or to take measurements at <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E> when conducting a complete traverse of a stack or duct with a diameter less than 16.5 ft (5.0 m).</P>
            <P>8.2.4 Special considerations. The following special considerations apply when the distance between traverse points is less than or equal to <FR>1/2</FR> in. (12.7 mm).</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1 A wall effects traverse point and the Method 1 traverse point. If the distance between a wall effects traverse point and the Method 1 traverse point is less than or equal to <FR>1/2</FR> in. (12.7 mm), taking measurements at both points is allowed but not required or recommended; if measurements are taken at only one point, take the measurements at the point that is farther from the wall and use the velocity obtained at that point as the value for both points (see sections 8.2.3 and 9.2 for related requirements).</P>

              <E T="52">rem</E> and <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">last</E> is less than or equal to <FR>1/2</FR> in. (12.7 mm), taking measurements at <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E> is allowed but not required or recommended; if measurements are not taken at <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E>, the measured velocity value at <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">last</E> must be used as the value for both <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">last</E> and <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E>.</P>
            <P>8.3 Traverse Point Sampling Order and Probe Selection. Determine the sampling order of the Method 1 and wall effects traverse points and select the appropriate probe for the measurements, taking into account the following considerations.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Traverse points on any radius may be sampled in either direction (i.e., from the wall toward the center of the stack or duct, or vice versa).</P>
            <P>8.3.2 To reduce the likelihood of velocity variations during the time of the traverse and the attendant potential impact on the wall effects-adjusted and unadjusted average velocities, the following provisions of this method shall be met.</P>
            <P>8.3.2.1 Each complete set of Method 1 and wall effects traverse points accessed from the same port shall be sampled without interruption. Unless traverses are performed simultaneously in all ports using separate probes at each port, this provision disallows first sampling all Method 1 points at all ports and then sampling all the wall effects points.</P>

            <P>8.3.2.2 The entire integrated Method 1 and wall effects traverse across all test ports shall be as short as practicable, consistent with the measurement system response time <PRTPAGE P="129"/>(see section 8.4.1.1) and sampling (see section 8.4.1.2) provisions of this method.</P>

            <P>8.3.3 It is recommended but not required that in each Method 1 equal-area sector closest to the wall, the Method 1 equal-area traverse point should be sampled in sequence between the adjacent wall effects traverse points. For example, for the traverse point configuration shown in Figure 2H-2, it is recommended that the Method 1 equal-area traverse point be sampled between <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">last</E> and <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E>. In this example, if the traverse is conducted from the wall toward the center of the stack or duct, it is recommended that measurements be taken at points in the following order: <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">1</E>, <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">2</E>, <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">last</E>, the Method 1 traverse point, <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="52">rem</E>, and then at the traverse points in the three Method 1 interior equal-area sectors.</P>
            <P>8.3.4 The same type of probe must be used to take measurements at all Method 1 and wall effects traverse points. However, different copies of the same type of probe may be used at different ports (e.g., Type S probe 1 at port A, Type S probe 2 at port B) or at different traverse points accessed from a particular port (e.g., Type S probe 1 for Method 1 interior traverse points accessed from port A, Type S probe 2 for wall effects traverse points and the Method 1 exterior traverse point accessed from port A). The identification number of the probe used to obtain measurements at each traverse point must be recorded.</P>
            <P>8.4 Measurements at Method 1 and Wall Effects Traverse Points. Conduct measurements at Method 1 and wall effects traverse points in accordance with Method 2, 2F, or 2G and in accordance with the provisions of the following subsections (some of which are included in Methods 2F and 2G but not in Method 2), which are particularly important for wall effects testing.</P>
            <P>8.4.1 Probe residence time at wall effects traverse points. Due to the steep temperature and pressure gradients that can occur close to the wall, it is very important for the probe residence time (i.e., the total time spent at a traverse point) to be long enough to ensure collection of representative temperature and pressure measurements. The provisions of Methods 2F and 2G in the following subsections shall be observed.</P>
            <P>8.4.1.1 System response time. Determine the response time of each probe measurement system by inserting and positioning the “cold” probe (at ambient temperature and pressure) at any Method 1 traverse point. Read and record the probe differential pressure, temperature, and elapsed time at 15-second intervals until stable readings for both pressure and temperature are achieved. The response time is the longer of these two elapsed times. Record the response time.</P>
            <P>8.4.1.2 Sampling. At the start of testing in each port (i.e., after a probe has been inserted into the stack gas stream), allow at least the response time to elapse before beginning to take measurements at the first traverse point accessed from that port. Provided that the probe is not removed from the stack gas stream, measurements may be taken at subsequent traverse points accessed from the same test port without waiting again for the response time to elapse.</P>
            <P>8.4.2 Temperature measurement for wall effects traverse points. Either (1) take temperature measurements at each wall effects traverse point in accordance with the applicable provisions of Method 2, 2F, or 2G; or (2) use the temperature measurement at the Method 1 traverse point closest to the wall as the temperature measurement for all the wall effects traverse points in the corresponding equal-area sector.</P>
            <P>8.4.3 Non-detectable velocity pressure at wall effects traverse points. If the probe cannot be positioned at a wall effects traverse point or if no velocity pressure can be detected at a wall effects point, measurements shall be taken at the first subsequent wall effects traverse point farther from the wall where velocity can be detected. Follow the instructions in section 8.7.1.2 of this method for recording results for wall effects traverse points where velocity pressure cannot be detected. It should be noted that the full extent of velocity decay may not be accounted for if measurements are not taken at the 1-in. incremented wall effects traverse points closest to the wall.</P>
            <P>8.5 Data Recording. For each wall effects and Method 1 traverse point where measurements are taken, record all pressure, temperature, and attendant measurements prescribed in section 3 of Method 2 or section 8.0 of Method 2F or 2G, as applicable.</P>

            <P>8.6 Point Velocity Calculation. For each wall effects and Method 1 traverse point, calculate the point velocity value (v<E T="54">i</E>) in accordance with sections 12.1 and 12.2 of Method 2F for tests using Method 2F and in accordance with sections 12.1 and 12.2 of Method 2G for tests using Method 2 and Method 2G. (Note that the term (v<E T="54">i</E>) in this method corresponds to the term (v<E T="54">a(i)</E>) in Methods 2F and 2G.) When the equations in the indicated sections of Method 2G are used in deriving point velocity values for Method 2 tests, set the value of the yaw angles appearing in the equations to 0°.</P>
            <P>8.7 Tabulating Calculated Point Velocity Values for Wall Effects Traverse Points. Enter the following values in a hardcopy or electronic form similar to Form 2H-1 (for 16-point Method 1 traverses) or Form 2H-2 (for Method 1 traverses consisting of more than 16 points). A separate form must be completed for each of the four Method 1 equal-area sectors that are closest to the wall.</P>

For every 1-in. incremented wall effects traverse point other than d<E T="54">last</E>, enter in column B of Form 2H-1 or 2H-2 either the velocity measured at the point (see section 8.7.1.1) or the velocity measured at the first subsequent traverse point farther from the wall (see section 8.7.1.2). A velocity value must be entered in column B of Form 2H-1 or 2H-2 for every 1-in. incremented traverse point from d<E T="54">1</E> (representing the wall effects traverse point 1 in. [2.5 cm] from the wall) to d<E T="54">last</E>.</P>

            <P>8.7.3 Point velocity value (<E T="03">v</E>
              <E T="54">drem</E>) at <E T="03">d</E>

              <E T="54">rem</E> in column G of row 4a in Form 2H-1 or 2H-2. If the distance between <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="54">rem</E> and <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="54">last</E> is less than or equal to <FR>1/2</FR> in. (12.7 mm), the measured velocity value at <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="54">last</E> may be used as the value at <E T="03">d</E>
              <E T="54">rem</E> (see section 8.2.4.2).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.0 Quality Control.</HD>
            <P>9.1 Particulate Matter Build-up in Horizontal Ducts. Wall effects testing of horizontal circular ducts should be conducted only if build-up of particulate matter or other material in the bottom of the duct is not present.</P>
            <P>9.2 Verifying Traverse Point Distances. In taking measurements at wall effects traverse points, it is very important for the probe impact pressure port to be positioned as close as practicable to the traverse point locations in the gas stream. For this reason, before beginning wall effects testing, it is important to calculate and record the traverse point positions that will be marked on each probe for each port, taking into account the distance that each port nipple (or probe mounting flange for automated probes) extends out of the stack and any extension of the port nipple (or mounting flange) into the gas stream. To ensure that traverse point positions are properly identified, the following procedures should be performed on each probe used.</P>
            <P>9.2.1 Manual probes. Mark the probe insertion distance of the wall effects and Method 1 traverse points on the probe sheath so that when a mark is aligned with the outside face of the stack port, the probe impact port is located at the calculated distance of the traverse point from the stack inside wall. The use of different colored marks is recommended for designating the wall effects and Method 1 traverse points. Before the first use of each probe, check to ensure that the distance of each mark from the center of the probe impact pressure port agrees with the previously calculated traverse point positions to within ±<FR>1/4</FR> in. (6.4 mm).</P>
            <P>9.2.2 Automated probe systems. For automated probe systems that mechanically position the probe head at prescribed traverse point positions, activate the system with the probe assemblies removed from the test ports and sequentially extend the probes to the programmed location of each wall effects traverse point and the Method 1 traverse points. Measure the distance between the center of the probe impact pressure port and the inside of the probe assembly mounting flange for each traverse point. The measured distances must agree with the previously calculated traverse point positions to within ±<FR>1/4</FR> in. (6.4 mm).</P>
            <P>9.3 Probe Installation. Properly sealing the port area is particularly important in taking measurements at wall effects traverse points. For testing involving manual probes, the area between the probe sheath and the port should be sealed with a tightly fitting flexible seal made of an appropriate material such as heavy cloth so that leakage is minimized. For automated probe systems, the probe assembly mounting flange area should be checked to verify that there is no leakage.</P>
            <P>9.4 Velocity Stability. This method should be performed only when the average gas velocity in the stack or duct is relatively constant over the duration of the test. If the average gas velocity changes significantly during the course of a wall effects test, the test results should be discarded.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> concentrations and dry molecular weight of a sample from an effluent gas stream of a fossil-fuel combustion process or other process.</P>

            <P>1.3 Other methods, as well as modifications to the procedure described herein, are also applicable for all of the above determinations. Examples of specific methods and modifications include: (1) A multi-point grab sampling method using an Orsat analyzer to analyze the individual grab sample obtained at each point; (2) a method for measuring either CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> and using stoichiometric calculations to determine dry molecular weight; and (3) assigning a value of 30.0 for dry molecular weight, in lieu of actual measurements, for processes burning natural gas, coal, or oil. These methods and modifications may be used, but are subject to the approval of the Administrator. The method may also be applicable to other processes where it has been determined that compounds other than CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen (N<E T="52">2</E>) are not present in concentrations sufficient to affect the results.</P>
            <P>1.4 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 A gas sample is extracted from a stack by one of the following methods: (1) single-point, grab sampling; (2) single-point, integrated sampling; or (3) multi-point, integrated sampling. The gas sample is analyzed for percent CO<E T="52">2</E> and percent O<E T="52">2</E>. For dry molecular weight determination, either an Orsat or a Fyrite analyzer may be used for the analysis.</P>

            <P>10.1 Analyzer. The analyzer and analyzer operator's technique should be audited periodically as follows: take a sample from a manifold containing a known mixture of CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E>, and analyze according to the procedure in section 11.3. Repeat this procedure until the measured concentration of three consecutive samples agrees with the stated value ±0.5 percent.

            <P>11.1 Maintenance. The Orsat or Fyrite-type analyzer should be maintained and operated according to the manufacturers specifications.</P>

            <P>11.2 Grab Sample Analysis. Use either an Orsat analyzer or a Fyrite-type combustion gas analyzer to measure O<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration for dry molecular weight determination, using procedures as specified in the analyzer user's manual. If an Orsat analyzer is used, it is recommended that the Orsat leak-check, described in section 11.5, be performed before this determination; however, the check is optional. Calculate the dry molecular weight as indicated in section 12.0. Repeat the sampling, analysis, and calculation procedures until the dry molecular weights of any three grab samples differ from their mean by no more than 0.3 g/g-mole (0.3 lb/lb-mole).

            <P>11.4 Standardization. A periodic check of the reagents and of operator technique should be conducted at least once every three series of test runs as outlined in section 10.1.</P>
            <P>11.5 Leak-Check Procedure for Orsat Analyzer. Moving an Orsat analyzer frequently causes it to leak. Therefore, an Orsat analyzer should be thoroughly leak-checked on site before the flue gas sample is introduced into it. The procedure for leak-checking an Orsat analyzer is as follows:</P>
            <P>11.5.1 Bring the liquid level in each pipette up to the reference mark on the capillary tubing, and then close the pipette stopcock.</P>
            <P>11.5.2 Raise the leveling bulb sufficiently to bring the confining liquid meniscus onto the graduated portion of the burette, and then close the manifold stopcock.</P>
            <P>11.5.3 Record the meniscus position.</P>
            <P>11.5.4 Observe the meniscus in the burette and the liquid level in the pipette for movement over the next 4 minutes.</P>
            <P>11.5.5 For the Orsat analyzer to pass the leak-check, two conditions must be met:</P>
            <P>11.5.5.1 The liquid level in each pipette must not fall below the bottom of the capillary tubing during this 4-minute interval.</P>
            <P>11.5.5.2 The meniscus in the burette must not change by more than 0.2 ml during this 4-minute interval.</P>
            <P>11.5.6 If the analyzer fails the leak-check procedure, check all rubber connections and stopcocks to determine whether they might be the cause of the leak. Disassemble, clean, and regrease any leaking stopcocks. Replace leaking rubber connections. After the analyzer is reassembled, repeat the leak-check procedure.</P>

This method is applicable for the determination of O<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and CO concentrations in the effluent from fossil-fuel combustion processes for use in excess air or emission rate correction factor calculations. Where compounds other than CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, CO, and nitrogen (N<E T="52">2</E>) are present in concentrations sufficient to affect the results, the calculation procedures presented in this method must be modified, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

            <P>1.3 Other methods, as well as modifications to the procedure described herein, are also applicable for all of the above determinations. Examples of specific methods and modifications include: (1) A multi-point sampling method using an Orsat analyzer to analyze individual grab samples obtained at each point, and (2) a method using CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> and stoichiometric calculations to determine excess air. These methods and modifications may be used, but are subject to the approval of the Administrator.<PRTPAGE P="152"/>

            </NOTE>
            <P>8.1 Single-Point, Grab Sampling and Analytical Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 The sampling point in the duct shall either be at the centroid of the cross section or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.0 m (3.3 ft), unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Set up the equipment as shown in Figure 3-1 of Method 3, making sure all connections ahead of the analyzer are tight. Leak-check the Orsat analyzer according to the procedure described in section 11.5 of Method 3. This leak-check is mandatory.</P>

            <P>8.1.3 Place the probe in the stack, with the tip of the probe positioned at the sampling point; purge the sampling line long enough to allow at least five exchanges. Draw a sample into the analyzer. For emission rate correction factor determinations, immediately analyze the sample for percent CO<E T="52">2</E> or percent O<E T="52">2</E>, as outlined in section 11.2. For excess air determination, immediately analyze the sample for percent CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, and CO, as outlined in section 11.2, and calculate excess air as outlined in section 12.2.</P>
            <P>8.1.4 After the analysis is completed, leak-check (mandatory) the Orsat analyzer once again, as described in section 11.5 of Method 3. For the results of the analysis to be valid, the Orsat analyzer must pass this leak-test before and after the analysis.</P>

            <P>8.2.2 Leak-check (mandatory) the flexible bag as in section 6.2.6 of Method 3. Set up the equipment as shown in Figure 3-2 of Method 3. Just before sampling, leak-check (mandatory) the train by placing a vacuum gauge at the condenser inlet, pulling a vacuum of at least 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg), plugging the outlet at the quick disconnect, and then turning off the pump. The vacuum should remain stable for at least 0.5 minute. Evacuate the flexible bag. Connect the probe, and place it in the stack, with the tip of the probe positioned at the sampling point; purge the sampling line. Next, connect the bag, and make sure that all connections are tight.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Sample at a constant rate, or as specified by the Administrator. The sampling run must be simultaneous with, and for the same total length of time as, the pollutant emission rate determination. Collect at least 28 liters (1.0 ft<SU>3</SU>) of sample gas. Smaller volumes may be collected, subject to approval of the Administrator.</P>

            <P>8.2.4 Obtain one integrated flue gas sample during each pollutant emission rate determination. For emission rate correction factor determination, analyze the sample within 4 hours after it is taken for percent CO<E T="52">2</E> or percent O<E T="52">2</E> (as outlined in section 11.2).</P>
            <P>8.3 Multi-Point, Integrated Sampling and Analytical Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation, or by the Administrator, a minimum of eight traverse points shall be used for circular stacks having diameters less than 0.61 m (24 in.), a minimum of nine shall be used for rectangular stacks having equivalent diameters less than 0.61 m (24 in.), and a minimum of 12 traverse points shall be used for all other cases. The traverse points shall be located according to Method 1.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Follow the procedures outlined in sections 8.2.2 through 8.2.4, except for the following: Traverse all sampling points, and sample at each point for an equal length of time. Record sampling data as shown in Figure 3-3 of Method 3.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.0 Quality Control</HD>

            <P>9.1 Data Validation Using Fuel Factor. Although in most instances, only CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> measurement is required, it is recommended that both CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> be measured to provide a check on the quality of the data. The data validation procedure of section 12.3 is suggested.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Since this method for validating the CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> analyses is based on combustion of organic and fossil fuels and dilution of the gas stream with air, this method does not apply to sources that (1) remove CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> through processes other than combustion, (2) add O<E T="52">2</E> (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> oxygen enrichment) and N<E T="52">2</E> in proportions different from that of air, (3) add CO<E T="52">2</E> (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> cement or lime kilns), or (4) have no fuel factor, F<E T="52">O</E>, values obtainable (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> extremely variable waste mixtures). This method validates the measured proportions of CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> for fuel type, but the method does not detect sample dilution resulting from leaks during or after sample collection. The method is applicable for samples collected downstream of most lime or limestone flue-gas desulfurization units as the CO<E T="52">2</E> added or removed from the gas stream is not significant in relation to the total CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration. The CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations from other types of scrubbers using only water or basic slurry can be significantly affected and would render the fuel factor check minimally useful.</P>

            <P>12.3.3 Calculated F<E T="52">o</E> values, beyond the acceptable ranges shown in this table, should be investigated before accepting the test results. For example, the strength of the solutions in the gas analyzer and the analyzing technique should be checked by sampling and analyzing a known concentration, such as air; the fuel factor should be reviewed and verified. An acceptability range of ±12 percent is appropriate for the F<E T="52">o</E> factor of mixed fuels with variable fuel ratios. The level of the emission rate relative to the compliance level should be considered in determining if a retest is appropriate; i.e., if the measured emissions are much lower or much greater than the compliance limit, repetition of the test would not significantly change the compliance status of the source and would be unnecessarily time consuming and costly.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Method 3C—Determination of Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrogen, and Oxygen From Stationary Sources</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Applicability and Principle</HD>

            <P>1.1 Applicability. This method applies to the analysis of carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>), methane (CH<E T="52">4</E>), nitrogen (N<E T="52">2</E>), and oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>) in samples from municipal solid waste landfills and other sources when specified in an applicable subpart.</P>

            <P>1.2 Principle. A portion of the sample is injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) and the CO<E T="52">2</E>, CH<E T="52">4</E>, N<E T="52">2</E>, and O<E T="52">2</E> concentrations are determined by using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and integrator.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Range and Sensitivity</HD>
            <P>2.1 Range. The range of this method depends upon the concentration of samples. The analytical range of TCD's is generally between approximately 10 ppmv and the upper percent range.</P>

            <P>2.2 Sensitivity. The sensitivity limit for a compound is defined as the minimum detectable concentration of that compound, or the concentration that produces a signal-to-noise ratio of three to one. For CO<E T="52">2</E>, CH<E T="52">4</E>, N<E T="52">2</E>, and O<E T="52">2</E>, the sensitivity limit is in the low ppmv range.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Interferences</HD>
            <P>Since the TCD exhibits universal response and detects all gas components except the carrier, interferences may occur. Choosing the appropriate GC or shifting the retention times by changing the column flow rate may help to eliminate resolution interferences.</P>
            <P>To assure consistent detector response, helium is used to prepare calibration gases. Frequent exposure to samples or carrier gas containing oxygen may gradually destroy filaments.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Apparatus</HD>
            <P>4.1 Gas Chromatograph. GC having at least the following components:</P>

            <P>4.1.1 Separation Column. Appropriate column(s) to resolve CO<E T="52">2</E>, CH<E T="52">4</E>, N<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, and other gas components that may be present in the sample.</P>

            <P>4.1.2 Sample Loop. Teflon or stainless steel tubing of the appropriate diameter.

            <P>6.1 Sample Collection. Use the sample collection procedures described in Methods 3 or 25C to collect a sample of landfill gas (LFG).</P>
            <P>6.2 Preparation of GC. Before putting the GC analyzer into routine operation, optimize the operational conditions according to the manufacturer's specifications to provide good resolution and minimum analysis time. Establish the appropriate carrier gas flow and set the detector sample and reference cell flow rates at exactly the same levels. Adjust the column and detector temperatures to the recommended levels. Allow sufficient time for temperature stabilization. This may typically require 1 hour for each change in temperature.</P>
            <P>6.3 Analyzer Linearity Check and Calibration. Perform this test before sample analysis.</P>
            <P>6.3.1 Using the gas mixtures in section 5.1, verify the detector linearity over the range of suspected sample concentrations with at least three concentrations per compound of interest. This initial check may also serve as the initial instrument calibration.</P>
            <P>6.3.2 You may extend the use of the analyzer calibration by performing a single-point calibration verification. Calibration verifications shall be performed by triplicate injections of a single-point standard gas. The concentration of the single-point calibration must either be at the midpoint of the calibration curve or at approximately the source emission concentration measured during operation of the analyzer.</P>
            <P>6.3.3 Triplicate injections must agree within 5 percent of their mean, and the average calibration verification point must agree within 10 percent of the initial calibration response factor. If these calibration verification criteria are not met, the initial calibration described in section 6.3.1, using at least three concentrations, must be repeated before analysis of samples can continue.</P>
            <P>6.3.4 For each instrument calibration, record the carrier and detector flow rates, detector filament and block temperatures, attenuation factor, injection time, chart speed, sample loop volume, and component concentrations.</P>

            <P>6.3.5 Plot a linear regression of the standard concentrations versus area values to obtain the response factor of each compound. Alternatively, response factors of uncorrected component concentrations (wet basis) may be generated using instrumental integration.

            <P>The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.</P>

            <P>Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference <PRTPAGE P="158"/>method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.</P>
            <P>Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.</P>
            <P>The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.</P>
            <P>Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.</P>
            <P>Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>2.1 A gas sample is extracted at a constant rate from the source; moisture is removed from the sample stream and determined either volumetrically or gravimetrically.</P>
            <P>2.2 The method contains two possible procedures: a reference method and an approximation method.</P>

            <P>2.2.1 The reference method is used for accurate determinations of moisture content (such as are needed to calculate emission data). The approximation method, provides estimates of percent moisture to aid in setting isokinetic sampling rates prior to a pollutant emission measurement run. The approximation method described herein is only a suggested approach; alternative means for approximating the moisture content (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> drying tubes, wet bulb-dry bulb techniques, condensation techniques, stoichiometric calculations, previous experience, etc.) are also acceptable.</P>

            <P>2.2.2 The reference method is often conducted simultaneously with a pollutant emission measurement run. When it is, calculation of percent isokinetic, pollutant emission rate, etc., for the run shall be based upon the results of the reference method or its equivalent. These calculations shall not <PRTPAGE P="159"/>be based upon the results of the approximation method, unless the approximation method is shown, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, to be capable of yielding results within one percent H<E T="52">2</E>O of the reference method.</P>

            <P>4.1 The moisture content of saturated gas streams or streams that contain water droplets, as measured by the reference method, may be positively biased. Therefore, when these conditions exist or are suspected, a second determination of the moisture content shall be made simultaneously with the reference method, as follows: Assume that the gas stream is saturated. Attach a temperature sensor [capable of measuring to ±1 °C (2 °F)] to the reference method probe. Measure the stack gas temperature at each traverse point (see section 8.1.1.1) during the reference method traverse, and calculate the average stack gas temperature. Next, determine the moisture percentage, either by: (1) Using a psychrometric chart and making appropriate corrections if the stack pressure is different from that of the chart, or (2) using saturation vapor pressure tables. In cases where the psychrometric chart or the saturation vapor pressure tables are not applicable (based on evaluation of the process), alternative methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, shall be used.</P>

            <P>8.1 Reference Method. The following procedure is intended for a condenser system (such as the impinger system described in section 6.1.1.8 of Method 5) incorporating volumetric analysis to measure the condensed moisture, and silica gel and gravimetric analysis to measure the moisture leaving the condenser.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Preliminary Determinations.</P>

            <P>8.1.1.1 Unless otherwise specified by the Administrator, a minimum of eight traverse points shall be used for circular stacks having diameters less than 0.61 m (24 in.), a minimum of nine points shall be used for rectangular stacks having equivalent diameters less than 0.61 m (24 in.), and a minimum of twelve traverse points shall be used in all <PRTPAGE P="160"/>other cases. The traverse points shall be located according to Method 1. The use of fewer points is subject to the approval of the Administrator. Select a suitable probe and probe length such that all traverse points can be sampled. Consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack (four total sampling ports) for large stacks, to permit use of shorter probe lengths. Mark the probe with heat resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.</P>
            <P>8.1.1.2 Select a total sampling time such that a minimum total gas volume of 0.60 scm (21 scf) will be collected, at a rate no greater than 0.021 m<SU>3</SU>/min (0.75 cfm). When both moisture content and pollutant emission rate are to be determined, the moisture determination shall be simultaneous with, and for the same total length of time as, the pollutant emission rate run, unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart of the standards.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Preparation of Sampling Train.</P>
            <P>8.1.2.1 Place known volumes of water in the first two impingers; alternatively, transfer water into the first two impingers and record the weight of each impinger (plus water) to the nearest 0.5 g. Weigh and record the weight of the silica gel to the nearest 0.5 g, and transfer the silica gel to the fourth impinger; alternatively, the silica gel may first be transferred to the impinger, and the weight of the silica gel plus impinger recorded.</P>
            <P>8.1.2.2 Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 4-1. Turn on the probe heater and (if applicable) the filter heating system to temperatures of approximately 120 °C (248 °F), to prevent water condensation ahead of the condenser. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed ice and water in the ice bath container.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Leak Check Procedures. It is recommended, but not required, that the volume metering system and sampling train be leak-checked as follows:</P>
            <P>8.1.3.1 Metering System. Same as Method 5, section 8.4.1.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.2 Sampling Train. Disconnect the probe from the first impinger or (if applicable) from the filter holder. Plug the inlet to the first impinger (or filter holder), and pull a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. A lower vacuum may be used, provided that it is not exceeded during the test. A leakage rate in excess of 4 percent of the average sampling rate or 0.00057 m<SU>3</SU>/min (0.020 cfm), whichever is less, is unacceptable. Following the leak check, reconnect the probe to the sampling train.</P>

            <P>8.1.4 Sampling Train Operation. During the sampling run, maintain a sampling rate within 10 percent of constant rate, or as specified by the Administrator. For each run, record the data required on a data sheet similar to that shown in Figure 4-3. Be sure to record the dry gas meter reading at the beginning and end of each sampling time increment and whenever sampling is halted. Take other appropriate readings at each sample point at least once during each time increment.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

              <P>When Method 4 is used concurrently with an isokinetic method (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Method 5) the sampling rate should be maintained at isokinetic conditions rather than 10 percent of constant rate.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.1.4.1 To begin sampling, position the probe tip at the first traverse point. Immediately start the pump, and adjust the flow to the desired rate. Traverse the cross section, sampling at each traverse point for an equal length of time. Add more ice and, if necessary, salt to maintain a temperature of less than 20 °C (68 °F) at the silica gel outlet.</P>
            <P>8.1.4.2 After collecting the sample, disconnect the probe from the first impinger (or from the filter holder), and conduct a leak check (mandatory) of the sampling train as described in section 8.1.3.2. Record the leak rate. If the leakage rate exceeds the allowable rate, either reject the test results or correct the sample volume as in section 12.3 of Method 5.</P>
            <P>8.2 Approximation Method.

            </NOTE>
            

            <P>8.2.1 Place exactly 5 ml water in each impinger. Leak check the sampling train as follows: Temporarily insert a vacuum gauge at or near the probe inlet. Then, plug the probe inlet and pull a vacuum of at least 250 mm (10 in.) Hg. Note the time rate of change of the dry gas meter dial; alternatively, a rotameter (0 to 40 ml/min) may be temporarily attached to the dry gas meter outlet to determine the leakage rate. A leak rate not in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate is acceptable.

              <P>Release the probe inlet plug slowly before turning off the pump.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.2.2 Connect the probe, insert it into the stack, and sample at a constant rate of 2 liters/min (0.071 cfm). Continue sampling until the dry gas meter registers about 30 liters (1.1 ft<SU>3</SU>) or until visible liquid droplets are carried over from the first impinger to the second. Record temperature, pressure, and dry gas meter readings as indicated by Figure 4-4.</P>

            <P>6.1 Sample Collection. The following items are required for sample collection:</P>

            <P>6.1.1 Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train used in this method is shown in Figure 5-1 in section 18.0. Complete construction details are given in APTD-0581 (Reference 2 in section 17.0); commercial models of this train are also available. For <PRTPAGE P="170"/>changes from APTD-0581 and for allowable modifications of the train shown in Figure 5-1, see the following subsections.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The operating and maintenance procedures for the sampling train are described in APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in section 17.0). Since correct usage is important in obtaining valid results, all users should read APTD-0576 and adopt the operating and maintenance procedures outlined in it, unless otherwise specified herein.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>6.1.1.1 Probe Nozzle. Stainless steel (316) or glass with a sharp, tapered leading edge. The angle of taper shall be ≤30°, and the taper shall be on the outside to preserve a constant internal diameter. The probe nozzle shall be of the button-hook or elbow design, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. If made of stainless steel, the nozzle shall be constructed from seamless tubing. Other materials of construction may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling should be available. Typical nozzle sizes range from 0.32 to 1.27 cm (<FR>1/8</FR> to <FR>1/2</FR> in) inside diameter (ID) in increments of 0.16 cm (<FR>1/16</FR> in). Larger nozzles sizes are also available if higher volume sampling trains are used. Each nozzle shall be calibrated, according to the procedures outlined in section 10.1.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.2 Probe Liner. Borosilicate or quartz glass tubing with a heating system capable of maintaining a probe gas temperature during sampling of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F), or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or as approved by the Administrator for a particular application. Since the actual temperature at the outlet of the probe is not usually monitored during sampling, probes constructed according to APTD-0581 and utilizing the calibration curves of APTD-0576 (or calibrated according to the procedure outlined in APTD-0576) will be considered acceptable. Either borosilicate or quartz glass probe liners may be used for stack temperatures up to about 480 °C (900 °F); quartz glass liners shall be used for temperatures between 480 and 900 °C (900 and 1,650 °F). Both types of liners may be used at higher temperatures than specified for short periods of time, subject to the approval of the Administrator. The softening temperature for borosilicate glass is 820 °C (1500 °F), and for quartz glass it is 1500 °C (2700 °F). Whenever practical, every effort should be made to use borosilicate or quartz glass probe liners. Alternatively, metal liners (e.g., 316 stainless steel, Incoloy 825 or other corrosion resistant metals) made of seamless tubing may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.3 Pitot Tube. Type S, as described in section 6.1 of Method 2, or other device approved by the Administrator. The pitot tube shall be attached to the probe (as shown in Figure 5-1) to allow constant monitoring of the stack gas velocity. The impact (high pressure) opening plane of the pitot tube shall be even with or above the nozzle entry plane (see Method 2, Figure 2-7) during sampling. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall have a known coefficient, determined as outlined in section 10.0 of Method 2.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.4 Differential Pressure Gauge. Inclined manometer or equivalent device (two), as described in section 6.2 of Method 2. One manometer shall be used for velocity head (Δp) readings, and the other, for orifice differential pressure readings.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.5 Filter Holder. Borosilicate glass, with a glass or Teflon frit filter support and a silicone rubber gasket. Other materials of construction (e.g., stainless steel or Viton) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. The holder design shall provide a positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter. The holder shall be attached immediately at the outlet of the probe (or cyclone, if used).</P>
            <P>6.1.1.6 Filter Heating System. Any heating system capable of monitoring and maintaining temperature around the filter shall be used to ensure the sample gas temperature exiting the filter of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F) during sampling or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for a particular application. The monitoring and regulation of the temperature around the filter may be done with the filter temperature sensor or another temperature sensor.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.7 Filter Temperature Sensor. A temperature sensor capable of measuring temperature to within ±3 °C (5.4 °F) shall be installed so that the sensing tip of the temperature sensor is in direct contact with the sample gas exiting the filter. The sensing tip of the sensor may be encased in glass, Teflon, or metal and must protrude at least <FR>1/2</FR> in. into the sample gas exiting the filter. The filter temperature sensor must be monitored and recorded during sampling to ensure a sample gas temperature exiting the filter of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F), or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for a particular application.</P>

            <P>6.1.1.8 Condenser. The following system shall be used to determine the stack gas moisture content: Four impingers connected in series with leak-free ground glass fittings or any similar leak-free noncontaminating fittings. The first, third, and fourth impingers shall be of the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing the tip with a 1.3 cm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) ID glass tube extending to about 1.3 cm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) from the bottom of the flask. The second impinger shall be of the Greenburg-Smith design with the standard <PRTPAGE P="171"/>tip. Modifications (e.g., using flexible connections between the impingers, using materials other than glass, or using flexible vacuum lines to connect the filter holder to the condenser) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. The first and second impingers shall contain known quantities of water (Section 8.3.1), the third shall be empty, and the fourth shall contain a known weight of silica gel, or equivalent desiccant. A temperature sensor, capable of measuring temperature to within 1 °C (2 °F) shall be placed at the outlet of the fourth impinger for monitoring purposes. Alternatively, any system that cools the sample gas stream and allows measurement of the water condensed and moisture leaving the condenser, each to within 1 ml or 1 g may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. An acceptable technique involves the measurement of condensed water either gravimetrically or volumetrically and the determination of the moisture leaving the condenser by: (1) monitoring the temperature and pressure at the exit of the condenser and using Dalton's law of partial pressures; or (2) passing the sample gas stream through a tared silica gel (or equivalent desiccant) trap with exit gases kept below 20 °C (68 °F) and determining the weight gain. If means other than silica gel are used to determine the amount of moisture leaving the condenser, it is recommended that silica gel (or equivalent) still be used between the condenser system and pump to prevent moisture condensation in the pump and metering devices and to avoid the need to make corrections for moisture in the metered volume.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>If a determination of the PM collected in the impingers is desired in addition to moisture content, the impinger system described above shall be used, without modification. Individual States or control agencies requiring this information shall be contacted as to the sample recovery and analysis of the impinger contents.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>6.1.1.9 Metering System. Vacuum gauge, leak-free pump, calibrated temperature sensors, dry gas meter (DGM) capable of measuring volume to within 2 percent, and related equipment, as shown in Figure 5-1. Other metering systems capable of maintaining sampling rates within 10 percent of isokinetic and of determining sample volumes to within 2 percent may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. When the metering system is used in conjunction with a pitot tube, the system shall allow periodic checks of isokinetic rates. The average DGM temperature for use in the calculations of section 12.0 may be obtained by averaging the two temperature sensors located at the inlet and outlet of the DGM as shown in Figure 5-3 or alternatively from a single temperature sensor located at the immediate outlet of the DGM or the plenum of the DGM.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.10 Sampling trains utilizing metering systems designed for higher flow rates than that described in APTD-0581 or APTD-0576 may be used provided that the specifications of this method are met.</P>

            <P>6.1.2 Barometer. Mercury, aneroid, or other barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in.).
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The barometric pressure reading may be obtained from a nearby National Weather Service station. In this case, the station value (which is the absolute barometric pressure) shall be requested and an adjustment for elevation differences between the weather station and sampling point shall be made at a rate of minus 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in.) per 30 m (100 ft) elevation increase or plus 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in) per 30 m (100 ft) elevation decrease.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>6.1.3 Gas Density Determination Equipment. Temperature sensor and pressure gauge, as described in sections 6.3 and 6.4 of Method 2, and gas analyzer, if necessary, as described in Method 3. The temperature sensor shall, preferably, be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling probe in a fixed configuration, such that the tip of the sensor extends beyond the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any metal. Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in the field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in the field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement with respect to the Type S pitot tube openings (see Method 2, Figure 2-4). As a second alternative, if a difference of not more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be introduced, the temperature sensor need not be attached to the probe or pitot tube. (This alternative is subject to the approval of the Administrator.)</P>
            <P>6.2 Sample Recovery. The following items are required for sample recovery:</P>
            <P>6.2.1 Probe-Liner and Probe-Nozzle Brushes. Nylon bristle brushes with stainless steel wire handles. The probe brush shall have extensions (at least as long as the probe) constructed of stainless steel, Nylon, Teflon, or similarly inert material. The brushes shall be properly sized and shaped to brush out the probe liner and nozzle.</P>
            <P>6.2.2 Wash Bottles. Two Glass wash bottles are recommended. Alternatively, polyethylene wash bottles may be used. It is recommended that acetone not be stored in polyethylene bottles for longer than a month.</P>

            <P>6.2.3 Glass Sample Storage Containers. Chemically resistant, borosilicate glass bottles, for acetone washes, 500 ml or 1000 ml. Screw cap liners shall either be rubber-backed Teflon or shall be constructed so as <PRTPAGE P="172"/>to be leak-free and resistant to chemical attack by acetone. (Narrow mouth glass bottles have been found to be less prone to leakage.) Alternatively, polyethylene bottles may be used.</P>
            <P>6.2.4 Petri Dishes. For filter samples; glass or polyethylene, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.2.5 Graduated Cylinder and/or Balance. To measure condensed water to within 1 ml or 0.5 g. Graduated cylinders shall have subdivisions no greater than 2 ml.</P>
            <P>6.2.6 Plastic Storage Containers. Air-tight containers to store silica gel.</P>
            <P>6.2.7 Funnel and Rubber Policeman. To aid in transfer of silica gel to container; not necessary if silica gel is weighed in the field.</P>
            <P>6.2.8 Funnel. Glass or polyethylene, to aid in sample recovery.</P>
            <P>6.3 Sample Analysis. The following equipment is required for sample analysis:</P>
            <P>6.3.1 Glass Weighing Dishes.</P>
            <P>6.3.2 Desiccator.</P>
            <P>6.3.3 Analytical Balance. To measure to within 0.1 mg.</P>
            <P>6.3.4 Balance. To measure to within 0.5 g.</P>
            <P>6.3.5 Beakers. 250 ml.</P>
            <P>6.3.6 Hygrometer. To measure the relative humidity of the laboratory environment.</P>
            <P>6.3.7 Temperature Sensor. To measure the temperature of the laboratory environment.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>
            <P>7.1 Sample Collection. The following reagents are required for sample collection:</P>

            <P>7.1.1 Filters. Glass fiber filters, without organic binder, exhibiting at least 99.95 percent efficiency (&lt;0.05 percent penetration) on 0.3 micron dioctyl phthalate smoke particles. The filter efficiency test shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM Method D 2986-71, 78, or 95a (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17). Test data from the supplier's quality control program are sufficient for this purpose. In sources containing SO<E T="52">2</E> or SO<E T="52">3</E>, the filter material must be of a type that is unreactive to SO<E T="52">2</E> or SO<E T="52">3</E>. Reference 10 in section 17.0 may be used to select the appropriate filter.</P>
            <P>7.1.2 Silica Gel. Indicating type, 6 to 16 mesh. If previously used, dry at 175 °C (350 °F) for 2 hours. New silica gel may be used as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or better) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>7.1.3 Water. When analysis of the material caught in the impingers is required, deionized distilled water [to conform to ASTM D1193-77 or 91 Type 3 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17)] with at least &lt;0.001 percent residue shall be used or as specified in the applicable method requiring analysis of the water. Run reagent blanks prior to field use to eliminate a high blank on test samples.</P>
            <P>7.1.4 Crushed Ice.</P>
            <P>7.2 Sample Recovery. Acetone, reagent grade, ≤0.001 percent residue, in glass bottles, is required. Acetone from metal containers generally has a high residue blank and should not be used. Sometimes, suppliers transfer acetone to glass bottles from metal containers; thus, acetone blanks shall be run prior to field use and only acetone with low blank values (≤0.001 percent) shall be used. In no case shall a blank value of greater than 0.001 percent of the weight of acetone used be subtracted from the sample weight.</P>
            <P>7.3 Sample Analysis. The following reagents are required for sample analysis:</P>
            <P>7.3.1 Acetone. Same as in section 7.2.</P>
            <P>7.3.2 Desiccant. Anhydrous calcium sulfate, indicating type. Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</HD>
            <P>8.1 Pretest Preparation. It is suggested that sampling equipment be maintained according to the procedures described in APTD-0576. Alternative mercury-free thermometers may be used if the thermometers are at a minimum equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Place 200 to 300 g of silica gel in each of several air-tight containers. Weigh each container, including silica gel, to the nearest 0.5 g, and record this weight. As an alternative, the silica gel need not be preweighed, but may be weighed directly in its impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Check filters visually against light for irregularities, flaws, or pinhole leaks. Label filters of the proper diameter on the back side near the edge using numbering machine ink. As an alternative, label the shipping containers (glass or polyethylene petri dishes), and keep each filter in its identified container at all times except during sampling.</P>

            <P>8.1.3 Desiccate the filters at 20 ±5.6 °C (68 ±10 °F) and ambient pressure for at least 24 hours. Weigh each filter (or filter and shipping container) at intervals of at least 6 hours to a constant weight (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> ≤0.5 mg change from previous weighing). Record results to the nearest 0.1 mg. During each weighing, the period for which the filter is exposed to the laboratory atmosphere shall be less than 2 minutes. Alternatively (unless otherwise specified by the Administrator), the filters may be oven dried at 105 °C (220 °F) for 2 to 3 hours, desiccated for 2 hours, and weighed. Procedures other than those described, which account for relative humidity effects, may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>8.2 Preliminary Determinations.</P>

            <P>8.2.1 Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling points according <PRTPAGE P="173"/>to Method 1 or as specified by the Administrator. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and the range of velocity heads using Method 2; it is recommended that a leak check of the pitot lines (see Method 2, section 8.1) be performed. Determine the moisture content using Approximation Method 4 or its alternatives for the purpose of making isokinetic sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight, as described in Method 2, section 8.6; if integrated Method 3 sampling is used for molecular weight determination, the integrated bag sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and for the same total length of time as, the particulate sample run.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads, such that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain isokinetic sampling rates. During the run, do not change the nozzle size. Ensure that the proper differential pressure gauge is chosen for the range of velocity heads encountered (see section 8.3 of Method 2).</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Select a suitable probe liner and probe length such that all traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack to reduce the required probe length.</P>
            <P>8.2.4 Select a total sampling time greater than or equal to the minimum total sampling time specified in the test procedures for the specific industry such that (l) the sampling time per point is not less than 2 minutes (or some greater time interval as specified by the Administrator), and (2) the sample volume taken (corrected to standard conditions) will exceed the required minimum total gas sample volume. The latter is based on an approximate average sampling rate.</P>
            <P>8.2.5 The sampling time at each point shall be the same. It is recommended that the number of minutes sampled at each point be an integer or an integer plus one-half minute, in order to avoid timekeeping errors.</P>
            <P>8.2.6 In some circumstances (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> batch cycles) it may be necessary to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to obtain smaller gas sample volumes. In these cases, the Administrator's approval must first be obtained.</P>
            <P>8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep all openings where contamination can occur covered until just prior to assembly or until sampling is about to begin. Place 100 ml of water in each of the first two impingers, leave the third impinger empty, and transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of preweighed silica gel from its container to the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be used, but care should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and carried out from the impinger during sampling. Place the container in a clean place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of the silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and recorded.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Using a tweezer or clean disposable surgical gloves, place a labeled (identified) and weighed filter in the filter holder. Be sure that the filter is properly centered and the gasket properly placed so as to prevent the sample gas stream from circumventing the filter. Check the filter for tears after assembly is completed.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 When glass probe liners are used, install the selected nozzle using a Viton A O-ring when stack temperatures are less than 260 °C (500 °F) or a heat-resistant string gasket when temperatures are higher. See APTD-0576 for details. Other connecting systems using either 316 stainless steel or Teflon ferrules may be used. When metal liners are used, install the nozzle as discussed above or by a leak-free direct mechanical connection. Mark the probe with heat resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.</P>
            <P>8.3.4 Set up the train as shown in Figure 5-1 ensuring that the connections are leak-tight. Subject to the approval of the Administrator, a glass cyclone may be used between the probe and filter holder when the total particulate catch is expected to exceed 100 mg or when water droplets are present in the stack gas.</P>
            <P>8.3.5 Place crushed ice around the impingers.</P>
            <P>8.4 Leak-Check Procedures.</P>
            <P>8.4.1 Leak Check of Metering System Shown in Figure 5-1. That portion of the sampling train from the pump to the orifice meter should be leak-checked prior to initial use and after each shipment. Leakage after the pump will result in less volume being recorded than is actually sampled. The following procedure is suggested (see Figure 5-2): Close the main valve on the meter box. Insert a one-hole rubber stopper with rubber tubing attached into the orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect and vent the low side of the orifice manometer. Close off the low side orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in.) water column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch off the tubing, and observe the manometer for one minute. A loss of pressure on the manometer indicates a leak in the meter box; leaks, if present, must be corrected.</P>
            <P>8.4.2 Pretest Leak Check. A pretest leak check of the sampling train is recommended, but not required. If the pretest leak check is conducted, the following procedure should be used.</P>

            <P>8.4.2.1 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the filter and probe heating systems to the desired operating temperatures. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. If a Viton A O-ring or <PRTPAGE P="174"/>other leak-free connection is used in assembling the probe nozzle to the probe liner, leak-check the train at the sampling site by plugging the nozzle and pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>A lower vacuum may be used, provided that it is not exceeded during the test.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.4.2.2 If a heat-resistant string is used, do not connect the probe to the train during the leak check. Instead, leak-check the train by first plugging the inlet to the filter holder (cyclone, if applicable) and pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum (see note in section 8.4.2.1). Then connect the probe to the train, and leak-check at approximately 25 mm (1 in.) Hg vacuum; alternatively, the probe may be leak-checked with the rest of the sampling train, in one step, at 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. Leakage rates in excess of 4 percent of the average sampling rate or 0.00057 m<SU>3</SU>/min (0.020 cfm), whichever is less, are unacceptable.</P>
            <P>8.4.2.3 The following leak-check instructions for the sampling train described in APTD-0576 and APTD-0581 may be helpful. Start the pump with the bypass valve fully open and the coarse adjust valve completely closed. Partially open the coarse adjust valve, and slowly close the bypass valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not reverse the direction of the bypass valve, as this will cause water to back up into the filter holder. If the desired vacuum is exceeded, either leak-check at this higher vacuum, or end the leak check and start over.</P>
            <P>8.4.2.4 When the leak check is completed, first slowly remove the plug from the inlet to the probe, filter holder, or cyclone (if applicable), and immediately turn off the vacuum pump. This prevents the water in the impingers from being forced backward into the filter holder and the silica gel from being entrained backward into the third impinger.</P>

            <P>8.4.3 Leak Checks During Sample Run. If, during the sampling run, a component (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> filter assembly or impinger) change becomes necessary, a leak check shall be conducted immediately before the change is made. The leak check shall be done according to the procedure outlined in section 8.4.2 above, except that it shall be done at a vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value recorded up to that point in the test. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m<SU>3</SU>/min (0.020 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are acceptable, and no correction will need to be applied to the total volume of dry gas metered; if, however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, either record the leakage rate and plan to correct the sample volume as shown in section 12.3 of this method, or void the sample run.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Immediately after component changes, leak checks are optional. If such leak checks are done, the procedure outlined in section 8.4.2 above should be used.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.4.4 Post-Test Leak Check. A leak check of the sampling train is mandatory at the conclusion of each sampling run. The leak check shall be performed in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 8.4.2, except that it shall be conducted at a vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value reached during the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m<SU>3</SU> min (0.020 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are acceptable, and no correction need be applied to the total volume of dry gas metered. If, however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, either record the leakage rate and correct the sample volume as shown in section 12.3 of this method, or void the sampling run.</P>
            <P>8.5 Sampling Train Operation. During the sampling run, maintain an isokinetic sampling rate (within 10 percent of true isokinetic unless otherwise specified by the Administrator) and a sample gas temperature through the filter of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F) or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>8.5.1 For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-3. Be sure to record the initial DGM reading. Record the DGM readings at the beginning and end of each sampling time increment, when changes in flow rates are made, before and after each leak check, and when sampling is halted. Take other readings indicated by Figure 5-3 at least once at each sample point during each time increment and additional readings when significant changes (20 percent variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional adjustments in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the manometer level and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature changes, make periodic checks during the traverse.</P>

            <P>8.5.2 Clean the portholes prior to the test run to minimize the chance of collecting deposited material. To begin sampling, verify that the filter and probe heating systems are up to temperature, remove the nozzle cap, verify that the pitot tube and probe are properly positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump, and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs are available which aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate without excessive computations. These nomographs are designed for use when the Type S pitot tube coefficient (C<E T="52">p</E>) is 0.85 ±0.02, and the stack gas equivalent density [dry molecular weight (M<E T="52">d</E>)] is equal to 29 ±4. APTD-0576 details the procedure for using the nomographs. If C<E T="52">p</E> and M<E T="52">d</E> are outside the above stated ranges, <PRTPAGE P="175"/>do not use the nomographs unless appropriate steps (see Reference 7 in section 17.0) are taken to compensate for the deviations.</P>

            <P>8.5.3 When the stack is under significant negative pressure (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> height of impinger stem), take care to close the coarse adjust valve before inserting the probe into the stack to prevent water from backing into the filter holder. If necessary, the pump may be turned on with the coarse adjust valve closed.</P>
            <P>8.5.4 When the probe is in position, block off the openings around the probe and porthole to prevent unrepresentative dilution of the gas stream.</P>
            <P>8.5.5 Traverse the stack cross-section, as required by Method 1 or as specified by the Administrator, being careful not to bump the probe nozzle into the stack walls when sampling near the walls or when removing or inserting the probe through the portholes; this minimizes the chance of extracting deposited material.</P>
            <P>8.5.6 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the temperature around the filter holder at the proper level to maintain the sample gas temperature exiting the filter; add more ice and, if necessary, salt to maintain a temperature of less than 20 °C (68 °F) at the condenser/silica gel outlet. Also, periodically check the level and zero of the manometer.</P>
            <P>8.5.7 If the pressure drop across the filter becomes too high, making isokinetic sampling difficult to maintain, the filter may be replaced in the midst of the sample run. It is recommended that another complete filter assembly be used rather than attempting to change the filter itself. Before a new filter assembly is installed, conduct a leak check (see section 8.4.3). The total PM weight shall include the summation of the filter assembly catches.</P>

            <P>8.5.8 A single train shall be used for the entire sample run, except in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more separate ducts or at two or more different locations within the same duct, or in cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of trains. In all other situations, the use of two or more trains will be subject to the approval of the Administrator.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of the front-half and (if applicable) impinger catches from each train shall be performed, unless identical nozzle sizes were used on all trains, in which case, the front-half catches from the individual trains may be combined (as may the impinger catches) and one analysis of front-half catch and one analysis of impinger catch may be performed. Consult with the Administrator for details concerning the calculation of results when two or more trains are used.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.5.9 At the end of the sample run, close the coarse adjust valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, record the final DGM meter reading, and conduct a post-test leak check, as outlined in section 8.4.4. Also, leak-check the pitot lines as described in Method 2, section 8.1. The lines must pass this leak check, in order to validate the velocity head data.</P>
            <P>8.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Calculate percent isokinetic (see Calculations, section 12.11) to determine whether the run was valid or another test run should be made. If there was difficulty in maintaining isokinetic rates because of source conditions, consult with the Administrator for possible variance on the isokinetic rates.</P>
            <P>8.7 Sample Recovery.</P>
            <P>8.7.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the probe to cool.</P>
            <P>8.7.2 When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external PM near the tip of the probe nozzle, and place a cap over it to prevent losing or gaining PM. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling down. This would create a vacuum in the filter holder, thereby drawing water from the impingers into the filter holder.</P>
            <P>8.7.3 Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sample train and cap the open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Cap the filter inlet where the probe was fastened. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger, and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used between the first impinger or condenser and the filter holder, disconnect the line at the filter holder, and let any condensed water or liquid drain into the impingers or condenser. Cap off the filter holder outlet and impinger inlet. Either ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps may be used to close these openings.</P>
            <P>8.7.4 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so that the chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be minimized.</P>
            <P>8.7.5 Save a portion of the acetone used for cleanup as a blank. From each storage container of acetone used for cleanup, save 200 ml and place in a glass sample container labeled “acetone blank.” To minimize any particulate contamination, rinse the wash bottle prior to filling from the tested container.</P>
            <P>8.7.6 Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly, and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows:</P>

            <P>8.7.6.1 Container No. 1. Carefully remove the filter from the filter holder, and place it in its identified petri dish container. Use a pair of tweezers and/or clean disposable surgical gloves to handle the filter. If it is necessary to fold the filter, do so such that the <PRTPAGE P="176"/>PM cake is inside the fold. Using a dry Nylon bristle brush and/or a sharp-edged blade, carefully transfer to the petri dish any PM and/or filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket. Seal the container.</P>
            <P>8.7.6.2 Container No. 2. Taking care to see that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover PM or any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, and front half of the filter holder by washing these components with acetone and placing the wash in a glass container. Deionized distilled water may be used instead of acetone when approved by the Administrator and shall be used when specified by the Administrator. In these cases, save a water blank, and follow the Administrator's directions on analysis. Perform the acetone rinse as follows:</P>
            <P>8.7.6.2.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle. Clean the inside surface by rinsing with acetone from a wash bottle and brushing with a Nylon bristle brush. Brush until the acetone rinse shows no visible particles, after which make a final rinse of the inside surface with acetone.</P>
            <P>8.7.6.2.2 Brush and rinse the inside parts of the fitting with acetone in a similar way until no visible particles remain.</P>
            <P>8.7.6.2.3 Rinse the probe liner with acetone by tilting and rotating the probe while squirting acetone into its upper end so that all inside surfaces will be wetted with acetone. Let the acetone drain from the lower end into the sample container. A funnel (glass or polyethylene) may be used to aid in transferring liquid washes to the container. Follow the acetone rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, squirt acetone into the upper end as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe; hold a sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any acetone and particulate matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or more until no visible PM is carried out with the acetone or until none remains in the probe liner on visual inspection. With stainless steel or other metal probes, run the brush through in the above prescribed manner at least six times since metal probes have small crevices in which particulate matter can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with acetone, and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final acetone rinse of the probe.</P>
            <P>8.7.6.2.4 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination.</P>
            <P>8.7.6.2.5 Clean the inside of the front half of the filter holder by rubbing the surfaces with a Nylon bristle brush and rinsing with acetone. Rinse each surface three times or more if needed to remove visible particulate. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. Carefully rinse out the glass cyclone, also (if applicable). After all acetone washings and particulate matter have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid on the sample container so that acetone will not leak out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to allow determination of whether leakage occurred during transport. Label the container to clearly identify its contents.</P>
            <P>8.7.6.3 Container No. 3. Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent, and make a notation of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth impinger to its original container, and seal. A funnel may make it easier to pour the silica gel without spilling. A rubber policeman may be used as an aid in removing the silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of dust particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use any water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available in the field, follow the procedure for Container No. 3 in section 11.2.3.</P>
            <P>8.7.6.4 Impinger Water. Treat the impingers as follows: Make a notation of any color or film in the liquid catch. Measure the liquid that is in the first three impingers to within 1 ml by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to within 0.5 g by using a balance. Record the volume or weight of liquid present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. Discard the liquid after measuring and recording the volume or weight, unless analysis of the impinger catch is required (see NOTE, section 6.1.1.8). If a different type of condenser is used, measure the amount of moisture condensed either volumetrically or gravimetrically.</P>
            <P>8.8 Sample Transport. Whenever possible, containers should be shipped in such a way that they remain upright at all times.</P>

            <P>9.2.1 Meter Orifice Check. Using the calibration data obtained during the calibration procedure described in section 10.3, determine the ΔH@ for the metering system orifice.

            <P>9.2.1.1 Before beginning the field test (a set of three runs usually constitutes a field test), operate the metering system (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> pump, volume meter, and orifice) at the ΔH@ pressure differential for 10 minutes. Record the volume collected, the DGM temperature, and the barometric pressure. Calculate a DGM calibration check value, Y<E T="52">c</E>, as follows:</P>
            <MATH DEEP="39" SPAN="1">

            <P>9.2.2 Calibrated Critical Orifice. A critical orifice, calibrated against a wet test meter or spirometer and designed to be inserted at the inlet of the sampling meter box, may be used as a check by following the procedure of section 16.2.</P>

            <P>10.1 Probe Nozzle. Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the ID of the nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in.). Make three separate measurements using different diameters each time, and obtain the average of the measurements. The difference between the high and low numbers shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in.). When nozzles become nicked, dented, or corroded, they shall be reshaped, sharpened, and recalibrated before use. Each nozzle shall be permanently and uniquely identified.</P>
            <P>10.2 Pitot Tube Assembly. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in section 10.1 of Method 2.</P>
            <P>10.3 Metering System.</P>

            <P>10.3.1 Calibration Prior to Use. Before its initial use in the field, the metering system shall be calibrated as follows: Connect the metering system inlet to the outlet of a wet test meter that is accurate to within 1 percent. Refer to Figure 5-4. The wet test meter should have a capacity of 30 liters/rev (1 ft<SU>3</SU>/rev). A spirometer of 400 liters (14 ft<SU>3</SU>) or more capacity, or equivalent, may be used for this calibration, although a wet test meter is usually more practical. The wet test meter should be periodically calibrated with a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test meters of other sizes may be used, provided that the specified accuracies of the procedure are maintained. Run the metering system pump for about 15 minutes with the orifice manometer indicating a median reading as expected in field use to allow the pump to warm up and to permit the interior surface of the wet test meter to be thoroughly wetted. Then, at each of a minimum of three orifice manometer settings, pass an exact quantity of gas through the wet test meter and note the gas volume indicated by the DGM. Also note the barometric pressure and the temperatures of the wet test meter, the inlet of the DGM, and the outlet of the DGM. Select the highest and lowest orifice settings to bracket the expected field operating range of the orifice. Use a minimum volume of 0.14 m<SU>3</SU> (5 ft<SU>3</SU>) at all orifice settings. Record all the data on a form similar to Figure 5-5 and calculate Y, the DGM calibration factor, and ΔH<E T="52"> </E>, the orifice calibration factor, at each orifice setting as shown on Figure 5-5. Allowable tolerances for individual Y and ΔH<E T="52"> </E> values are given in Figure 5-5. Use the average of the Y values in the calculations in section 12.0.</P>

            <P>10.3.1.1 Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested that a leak check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm pumps, the normal leak-check procedure will not detect leakages within the pump. For these cases the following leak-check procedure is suggested: make a 10-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m<SU>3</SU>/min (0.020 cfm). At the end of the run, take the difference of the measured wet test meter and DGM volumes. Divide the difference by <PRTPAGE P="178"/>10 to get the leak rate. The leak rate should not exceed 0.00057 m<SU>3</SU>/min (0.020 cfm).</P>

            <P>10.3.2 Calibration After Use. After each field use, the calibration of the metering system shall be checked by performing three calibration runs at a single, intermediate orifice setting (based on the previous field test), with the vacuum set at the maximum value reached during the test series. To adjust the vacuum, insert a valve between the wet test meter and the inlet of the metering system. Calculate the average value of the DGM calibration factor. If the value has changed by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the meter over the full range of orifice settings, as detailed in section 10.3.1.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Alternative procedures (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> rechecking the orifice meter coefficient) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>10.3.3 Acceptable Variation in Calibration Check. If the DGM coefficient values obtained before and after a test series differ by more than 5 percent, the test series shall either be voided, or calculations for the test series shall be performed using whichever meter coefficient value (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, before or after) gives the lower value of total sample volume.</P>

            <P>10.4 Probe Heater Calibration. Use a heat source to generate air heated to selected temperatures that approximate those expected to occur in the sources to be sampled. Pass this air through the probe at a typical sample flow rate while measuring the probe inlet and outlet temperatures at various probe heater settings. For each air temperature generated, construct a graph of probe heating system setting versus probe outlet temperature. The procedure outlined in APTD-0576 can also be used. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used. Also, probes with outlet temperature monitoring capabilities do not require calibration.

              <P>The probe heating system shall be calibrated before its initial use in the field.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>10.5 Temperature Sensors. Use the procedure in Section 10.3 of Method 2 to calibrate in-stack temperature sensors. Dial thermometers, such as are used for the DGM and condenser outlet, shall be calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers. An alternative mercury-free NIST-traceable thermometer may be used if the thermometer is, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application. As an alternative, the following single-point calibration procedure may be used. After each test run series, check the accuracy (and, hence, the calibration) of each thermocouple system at ambient temperature, or any other temperature, within the range specified by the manufacturer, using a reference thermometer (either ASTM reference thermometer or a thermometer that has been calibrated against an ASTM reference thermometer). The temperatures of the thermocouple and reference thermometers shall agree to within ±2 °F.</P>
            <P>10.6 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer or NIST-traceable barometer prior to the field test. Alternatively, barometric pressure may be obtained from a weather report that has been adjusted for the test point (on the stack) elevation.</P>
            <P>10.7 Field Balance Calibration Check. Check the calibration of the balance used to weigh impingers with a weight that is at least 500g or within 50g of a loaded impinger. The weight must be ASTM E617-13 “Standard Specification for Laboratory Weights and Precision Mass Standards” (incorporated by reference—see 40 CFR 60.17) Class 6 (or better). Daily before use, the field balance must measure the weight within ±0.5g of the certified mass. If the daily balance calibration check fails, perform corrective measures and repeat the check before using balance.</P>
            <P>10.8 Analytical Balance Calibration. Perform a multipoint calibration (at least five points spanning the operational range) of the analytical balance before the first use, and semiannually thereafter. The calibration of the analytical balance must be conducted using ASTM E617-13 “Standard Specification for Laboratory Weights and Precision Mass Standards” (incorporated by reference—see 40 CFR 60.17) Class 2 (or better) tolerance weights. Audit the balance each day it is used for gravimetric measurements by weighing at least one ASTM E617-13 Class 2 tolerance (or better) calibration weight that corresponds to 50 to 150 percent of the weight of one filter or between 1g and 5g. If the scale cannot reproduce the value of the calibration weight to within 0.5 mg of the certified mass, perform corrective measures, and conduct the multipoint calibration before use.</P>

            <P>11.2 Handle each sample container as follows:</P>

            <P>11.2.1 Container No. 1. Leave the contents in the shipping container or transfer the filter and any loose PM from the sample container to a tared weighing container. Desiccate for 24 hours in a desiccator containing anhydrous calcium sulfate. Weigh to a constant weight, and report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. For the purposes of this section, the term “constant weight” means a difference of no more than 0.5 mg or 1 percent of total weight less tare weight, whichever is greater, between two consecutive weighings, with no less than 6 hours of desiccation time between weighings. Alternatively, the sample may be oven dried at <PRTPAGE P="179"/>104 °C (220 °F) for 2 to 3 hours, cooled in the desiccator, and weighed to a constant weight, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The sample may be oven dried at 104 °C (220 °F) for 2 to 3 hours. Once the sample has cooled, weigh the sample, and use this weight as a final weight.</P>
            <P>11.2.2 Container No. 2. Note the level of liquid in the container, and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Measure the liquid in this container either volumetrically to ±1 ml or gravimetrically to ±0.5 g. Transfer the contents to a tared 250 ml beaker, and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. Desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg.</P>
            <P>11.2.3 Container No. 3. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. This step may be conducted in the field.</P>

            <P>11.2.4 Acetone Blank Container. Measure the acetone in this container either volumetrically or gravimetrically. Transfer the acetone to a tared 250 ml beaker, and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. Desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg.

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The contents of Container No. 2 as well as the acetone blank container may be evaporated at temperatures higher than ambient. If evaporation is done at an elevated temperature, the temperature must be below the boiling point of the solvent; also, to prevent “bumping,” the evaporation process must be closely supervised, and the contents of the beaker must be swirled occasionally to maintain an even temperature. Use extreme care, as acetone is highly flammable and has a low flash point.</P>

            <P>16.1 Dry Gas Meter as a Calibration Standard. A DGM may be used as a calibration standard for volume measurements in place of the wet test meter specified in section 10.3, provided that it is calibrated initially and recalibrated periodically as follows:</P>
            <P>16.1.1 Standard Dry Gas Meter Calibration.</P>

            <P>16.1.1.1. The DGM to be calibrated and used as a secondary reference meter should be of high quality and have an appropriately sized capacity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 3 liters/rev (0.1 ft<SU>3</SU>/rev)). A spirometer (400 liters (14 ft<SU>3</SU>) or more capacity), or equivalent, may be used for this calibration, although a wet test meter is usually more practical. The wet test meter should have a capacity of 30 liters/rev (1 ft<SU>3</SU>/rev) and capable of measuring volume to within 1.0 percent. Wet test meters should be checked against a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test meters of other sizes may be used, provided that <PRTPAGE P="182"/>the specified accuracies of the procedure are maintained.</P>

            <P>16.1.1.2 Set up the components as shown in Figure 5-7. A spirometer, or equivalent, may be used in place of the wet test meter in the system. Run the pump for at least 5 minutes at a flow rate of about 10 liters/min (0.35 cfm) to condition the interior surface of the wet test meter. The pressure drop indicated by the manometer at the inlet side of the DGM should be minimized (no greater than 100 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (4 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) at a flow rate of 30 liters/min (1 cfm)). This can be accomplished by using large diameter tubing connections and straight pipe fittings.</P>
            <P>16.1.1.3 Collect the data as shown in the example data sheet (see Figure 5-8). Make triplicate runs at each of the flow rates and at no less than five different flow rates. The range of flow rates should be between 10 and 34 liters/min (0.35 and 1.2 cfm) or over the expected operating range.</P>

            <P>16.1.1.5 Compare the three Y<E T="52">ds</E> values at each of the flow rates and determine the maximum and minimum values. The difference between the maximum and minimum values at each flow rate should be no greater than 0.030. Extra sets of triplicate runs may be made in order to complete this requirement. In addition, the meter coefficients should be between 0.95 and 1.05. If these specifications cannot be met in three sets of successive triplicate runs, the meter is not suitable as a calibration standard and should not be used as such. If these specifications are met, average the three Y<E T="52">ds</E> values at each flow rate resulting in no less than five average meter coefficients, Y<E T="52">ds</E>.</P>
            <P>16.1.1.6 Prepare a curve of meter coefficient, Y<E T="52">ds</E>, versus flow rate, Q, for the DGM. This curve shall be used as a reference when the meter is used to calibrate other DGMs and to determine whether recalibration is required.</P>
            <P>16.1.2 Standard Dry Gas Meter Recalibration.</P>
            <P>16.1.2.1 Recalibrate the standard DGM against a wet test meter or spirometer annually or after every 200 hours of operation, whichever comes first. This requirement is valid provided the standard DGM is kept in a laboratory and, if transported, cared for as any other laboratory instrument. Abuse to the standard meter may cause a change in the calibration and will require more frequent recalibrations.</P>
            <P>16.1.2.2 As an alternative to full recalibration, a two-point calibration check may be made. Follow the same procedure and equipment arrangement as for a full recalibration, but run the meter at only two flow rates [suggested rates are 14 and 30 liters/min (0.5 and 1.0 cfm)]. Calculate the meter coefficients for these two points, and compare the values with the meter calibration curve. If the two coefficients are within 1.5 percent of the calibration curve values at the same flow rates, the meter need not be recalibrated until the next date for a recalibration check.</P>
            <P>16.2 Critical Orifices As Calibration Standards. Critical orifices may be used as calibration standards in place of the wet test meter specified in section 16.1, provided that they are selected, calibrated, and used as follows:</P>
            <P>16.2.1 Selection of Critical Orifices.</P>

            <P>16.2.1.1 The procedure that follows describes the use of hypodermic needles or stainless steel needle tubings which have been found suitable for use as critical orifices. Other materials and critical orifice designs may be used provided the orifices act as true critical orifices (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a critical vacuum can be obtained, as described in section 16.2.2.2.3). Select five critical orifices that are appropriately sized to cover the range of <PRTPAGE P="183"/>flow rates between 10 and 34 liters/min (0.35 and 1.2 cfm) or the expected operating range. Two of the critical orifices should bracket the expected operating range. A minimum of three critical orifices will be needed to calibrate a Method 5 DGM; the other two critical orifices can serve as spares and provide better selection for bracketing the range of operating flow rates. The needle sizes and tubing lengths shown in Table 5-1 in section 18.0 give the approximate flow rates.</P>
            <P>16.2.1.2 These needles can be adapted to a Method 5 type sampling train as follows: Insert a serum bottle stopper, 13 by 20 mm sleeve type, into a <FR>1/2</FR>-inch Swagelok (or equivalent) quick connect. Insert the needle into the stopper as shown in Figure 5-9.</P>
            <P>16.2.2 Critical Orifice Calibration. The procedure described in this section uses the Method 5 meter box configuration with a DGM as described in section 6.1.1.9 to calibrate the critical orifices. Other schemes may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

            <P>16.2.2.1 Calibration of Meter Box. The critical orifices must be calibrated in the same configuration as they will be used (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> there should be no connections to the inlet of the orifice).</P>

            <P>16.2.2.1.1 Before calibrating the meter box, leak check the system as follows: Fully open the coarse adjust valve, and completely close the by-pass valve. Plug the inlet. Then turn on the pump, and determine whether there is any leakage. The leakage rate shall be zero (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> no detectable movement of the DGM dial shall be seen for 1 minute).</P>
            <P>16.2.2.1.2 Check also for leakages in that portion of the sampling train between the pump and the orifice meter. See section 8.4.1 for the procedure; make any corrections, if necessary. If leakage is detected, check for cracked gaskets, loose fittings, worn O-rings, etc., and make the necessary repairs.</P>
            <P>16.2.2.1.3 After determining that the meter box is leakless, calibrate the meter box according to the procedure given in section 10.3. Make sure that the wet test meter meets the requirements stated in section 16.1.1.1. Check the water level in the wet test meter. Record the DGM calibration factor, Y.</P>
            <P>16.2.2.2 Calibration of Critical Orifices. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 5-10.</P>
            <P>16.2.2.2.1 Allow a warm-up time of 15 minutes. This step is important to equilibrate the temperature conditions through the DGM.</P>
            <P>16.2.2.2.2 Leak check the system as in section 16.2.2.1.1. The leakage rate shall be zero.</P>
            <P>16.2.2.2.3 Before calibrating the critical orifice, determine its suitability and the appropriate operating vacuum as follows: Turn on the pump, fully open the coarse adjust valve, and adjust the by-pass valve to give a vacuum reading corresponding to about half of atmospheric pressure. Observe the meter box orifice manometer reading, ΔH. Slowly increase the vacuum reading until a stable reading is obtained on the meter box orifice manometer. Record the critical vacuum for each orifice. Orifices that do not reach a critical value shall not be used.</P>

            <P>16.2.2.2.4 Obtain the barometric pressure using a barometer as described in section 6.1.2. Record the barometric pressure, P<E T="52">bar</E>, in mm Hg (in. Hg).</P>
            <P>16.2.2.2.5 Conduct duplicate runs at a vacuum of 25 to 50 mm Hg (1 to 2 in. Hg) above the critical vacuum. The runs shall be at least 5 minutes each. The DGM volume readings shall be in increments of complete revolutions of the DGM. As a guideline, the times should not differ by more than 3.0 seconds (this includes allowance for changes in the DGM temperatures) to achieve ±0.5 percent in K′ (see Eq. 5-11). Record the information listed in Figure 5-11.</P>
            <P>16.2.2.2.6 Calculate K′ using Equation 5-11.</P>

            <P>16.2.3.5 To determine the need for recalibrating the critical orifices, compare the DGM Y factors obtained from two adjacent orifices each time a DGM is calibrated; for example, when checking orifice 13/2.5, use orifices 12/10.2 and 13/5.1. If any critical orifice yields a DGM Y factor differing by more than 2 percent from the others, recalibrate the critical orifice according to section 16.2.2.</P>
            <P>16.3 Alternative Post-Test Metering System Calibration. The following procedure may be used as an alternative to the post-test calibration described in Section 10.3.2. This alternative procedure does not detect leakages between the inlet of the metering system and the dry gas meter. Therefore, two steps must be included to make it an equivalent alternative:</P>
            <P>(1) The metering system must pass the post-test leak-check from either the inlet of the sampling train or the inlet of the metering system. Therefore, if the train fails the former leak-check, another leak-check from the inlet of the metering system must be conducted;</P>
            <P>(2) The metering system must pass the leak-check of that portion of the train from the pump to the orifice meter as described in Section 8.4.1.</P>
            <P>16.3.1 After each test run, do the following:</P>
            <P>16.3.1.1 Ensure that the metering system has passed the post-test leak-check. If not, conduct a leak-check of the metering system from its inlet.</P>
            <P>16.3.1.2 Conduct the leak-check of that portion of the train from the pump to the orifice meter as described in Section 10.3.1.1.</P>

            <P>16.3.2.2 If the average Y<E T="52">qa</E> does not meet the 5 percent criterion, recalibrate the meter <PRTPAGE P="185"/>over the full range of orifice settings as detailed in Section 10.3.1. Then follow the procedure in Section 10.3.3.</P>

            <P>11.1 Analysis. Record the data required on a sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5A-1. Handle each sample container as follows:</P>
            <P>11.1.1 Container No. 1 (Filter). Transfer the filter from the sample container to a tared glass weighing dish, and desiccate for 24 hours in a desiccator containing anhydrous calcium sulfate. Rinse Container No. 1 with a measured amount of TCE, and analyze this rinse with the contents of Container No. 2. Weigh the filter to a constant weight. For the purpose of this analysis, the term “constant weight” means a difference of no more than 10 percent of the net filter weight or 2 mg (whichever is greater) between two consecutive weighings made 24 hours apart. Report the “final weight” to the nearest 0.1 mg as the average of these two values.</P>
            <P>11.1.2 Container No. 2 (Probe to Filter Holder).</P>
            <P>11.1.2.1 Before adding the rinse from Container No. 1 to Container No. 2, note the level of liquid in Container No. 2, and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If noticeable leakage occurred, either void the sample or take steps, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results.</P>
            <P>11.1.2.2 Add the rinse from Container No. 1 to Container No. 2 and measure the liquid in this container either volumetrically to ±1 ml or gravimetrically to ±0.5 g. Check to see whether there is any appreciable quantity of condensed water present in the TCE rinse (look for a boundary layer or phase separation). If the volume of condensed water appears larger than 5 ml, separate the oil-TCE fraction from the water fraction using a separatory funnel. Measure the volume of the water phase to the nearest ml; adjust the stack gas moisture content, if necessary (see sections 12.3 and 12.4). Next, extract the water phase with several 25-ml portions of TCE until, by visual observation, the TCE does not remove any additional organic material. Transfer the remaining water fraction to a tared beaker and evaporate to dryness at 93 °C (200 °F), desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to the nearest 0.1 mg.</P>
            <P>11.1.2.3 Treat the total TCE fraction (including TCE from the filter container rinse and water phase extractions) as follows: Transfer the TCE and oil to a tared beaker, and evaporate at ambient temperature and pressure. The evaporation of TCE from the solution may take several days. Do not desiccate the sample until the solution reaches an apparent constant volume or until the odor of TCE is not detected. When it appears that the TCE has evaporated, desiccate the sample, and weigh it at 24-hour intervals to obtain a “constant weight” (as defined for Container No. 1 above). The “total weight” for Container No. 2 is the sum of the evaporated PM weight of the TCE-oil and water phase fractions. Report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg.</P>
            <P>11.1.3 Container No. 3 (Silica Gel). This step may be conducted in the field. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance.</P>

            <P>11.1.4 “TCE Blank” Container. Measure TCE in this container either volumetrically or gravimetrically. Transfer the TCE to a tared 250-ml beaker, and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. <PRTPAGE P="199"/>Desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg.

            <P>11.1 Record and report the data required on a sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5B-1.</P>
            <P>11.2 Handle each sample container as follows:</P>
            <P>11.2.1 Container No. 1. Leave the contents in the shipping container or transfer the filter and any loose PM from the sample container to a tared non-reactive oven-proof container. Oven dry the filter sample at a temperature of 160 ±5 °C (320 ±9 °F) for 6 hours. Cool in a desiccator for 2 hours, and weigh to constant weight. Report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. For the purposes of this section, the term “constant weight” means a difference of no more than 0.5 mg or 1 percent of total weight less tare weight, whichever is greater, between two consecutive weighings, with no less than 6 hours of desiccation time between weighings.</P>
            <P>11.2.2 Container No. 2. Note the level of liquid in the container, and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Measure the liquid in this container either volumetrically to ±1 ml or gravimetrically to ±0.5 g. Transfer the contents to a tared 250 ml beaker, and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. Then oven dry the probe sample at a temperature of 160 ±5 °C (320 ±9 °F) for 6 hours. Cool in a desiccator for 2 hours, and weigh to constant weight. Report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg.</P>
            <P>11.2.3 Container No. 3. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. This step may be conducted in the field.</P>
            <P>11.2.4 Acetone Blank Container. Measure the acetone in this container either volumetrically or gravimetrically. Transfer the acetone to a tared 250 ml beaker, and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. Desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="04">Note:</E> The contents of Container No. 2 as well as the acetone blank container may be evaporated at temperatures higher than ambient. If evaporation is done at an elevated temperature, the temperature must be below the boiling point of the solvent; also, to prevent “bumping,” the evaporation process must be closely supervised, and the contents of the beaker must be swirled occasionally to maintain an even temperature. Use extreme care, as acetone is highly flammable and has a low flash point.</P>

            <P>1.1 Analyte. Particulate matter (PM). No CAS number assigned.</P>
            <P>1.2 Applicability.</P>
            <P>1.2.1 This method is applicable for the determination of PM emissions from positive pressure fabric filters. Emissions are determined in terms of concentration (mg/m<SU>3</SU> or gr/ft<SU>3</SU>) and emission rate (kg/hr or lb/hr).</P>
            <P>1.2.2 The General Provisions of 40 CFR part 60, § 60.8(e), require that the owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide performance testing facilities. Such performance testing facilities include sampling ports, safe sampling platforms, safe access to sampling sites, and utilities for testing. It is intended that affected facilities also provide sampling locations that meet the specification for adequate stack length and minimal flow disturbances as described in Method 1. Provisions for testing are often overlooked factors in designing fabric filters or are extremely costly. The purpose of this procedure is to identify appropriate alternative locations and procedures for sampling the emissions from positive pressure fabric filters. The requirements that the affected facility owner or operator provide adequate access to performance testing facilities remain in effect.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>

            <P>Same section 8.0 of either Method 5 or Method 17, except replace section 8.2.1 of Method 5 with the following:</P>
            <P>8.1 Determination of Measurement Site. The configuration of positive pressure fabric filter structures frequently are not amenable to emission testing according to the requirements of Method 1. Following are several alternatives for determining measurement sites for positive pressure fabric filters.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Stacks Meeting Method 1 Criteria. Use a measurement site as specified in Method 1, section 11.1.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Short Stacks Not Meeting Method 1 Criteria. Use stack extensions and the procedures in Method 1. Alternatively, use flow straightening vanes of the “egg-crate” type (see Figure 5D-1). Locate the measurement site downstream of the straightening vanes at a distance equal to or greater than two times the average equivalent diameter of the vane openings and at least one-half of the overall stack diameter upstream of the stack outlet.</P>

            <P>8.1.3 Roof Monitor or Monovent. (See Figure 5D-2). For a positive pressure fabric filter equipped with a peaked roof monitor, ridge vent, or other type of monovent, use a measurement site at the base of the monovent. Examples of such locations are shown in Figure 5D-2. The measurement site must be upstream of any exhaust point (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> louvered vent).</P>

            <P>8.1.4 Compartment Housing. Sample immediately downstream of the filter bags directly above the tops of the bags as shown in the examples in Figure 5D-2. Depending on the housing design, use sampling ports in the housing walls or locate the sampling equipment within the compartment housing.<PRTPAGE P="203"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.2 Determination of Number and Location of Traverse Points. Locate the traverse points according to Method 1, section 11.3. Because a performance test consists of at least three test runs and because of the varied configurations of positive pressure fabric filters, there are several schemes by which the number of traverse points can be determined and the three test runs can be conducted.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Single Stacks Meeting Method 1 Criteria. Select the number of traverse points according to Method 1. Sample all traverse points for each test run.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Other Single Measurement Sites. For a roof monitor or monovent, single compartment housing, or other stack not meeting Method 1 criteria, use at least 24 traverse points. For example, for a rectangular measurement site, such as a monovent, use a balanced 5 × 5 traverse point matrix. Sample all traverse points for each test run.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Multiple Measurement Sites. Sampling from two or more stacks or measurement sites may be combined for a test run, provided the following guidelines are met:</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1 All measurement sites up to 12 must be sampled. For more than 12 measurement sites, conduct sampling on at least 12 sites or 50 percent of the sites, whichever is greater. The measurement sites sampled should be evenly, or nearly evenly, distributed among the available sites; if not, all sites are to be sampled.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.2 The same number of measurement sites must be sampled for each test run.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.3 The minimum number of traverse points per test run is 24. An exception to the 24-point minimum would be a test combining the sampling from two stacks meeting Method 1 criteria for acceptable stack length, and Method 1 specifies fewer than 12 points per site.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.4 As long as the 24 traverse points per test run criterion is met, the number of traverse points per measurement site may be reduced to eight.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.5 Alternatively, conduct a test run for each measurement site individually using the criteria in section 8.2.1 or 8.2.2 to determine the number of traverse points. Each test run shall count toward the total of three required for a performance test. If more than three measurement sites are sampled, the number of traverse points per measurement site may be reduced to eight as long as at least 72 traverse points are sampled for all the tests.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.6 The following examples demonstrate the procedures for sampling multiple measurement sites.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.6.1 Example 1: A source with nine circular measurement sites of equal areas may be tested as follows: For each test run, traverse three measurement sites using four points per diameter (eight points per measurement site). In this manner, test run number 1 will include sampling from sites 1,2, and 3; run 2 will include samples from sites 4, 5, and 6; and run 3 will include sites 7, 8, and 9. Each test area may consist of a separate test of each measurement site using eight points. Use the results from all nine tests in determining the emission average.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.6.2 Example 2: A source with 30 rectangular measurement sites of equal areas may be tested as follows: For each of the three test runs, traverse five measurement sites using a 3 × 3 matrix of traverse points for each site. In order to distribute the sampling evenly over all the available measurement sites while sampling only 50 percent of the sites, number the sites consecutively from 1 to 30 and sample all the even numbered (or odd numbered) sites. Alternatively, conduct a separate test of each of 15 measurement sites using section 8.2.1 or 8.2.2 to determine the number and location of traverse points, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.6.3 Example 3: A source with two measurement sites of equal areas may be tested as follows: For each test of three test runs, traverse both measurement sites, using section 8.2.3 in determining the number of traverse points. Alternatively, conduct two full emission test runs for each measurement site using the criteria in section 8.2.1 or 8.2.2 to determine the number of traverse points.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.7 Other test schemes, such as random determination of traverse points for a large number of measurement sites, may be used with prior approval from the Administrator.</P>
            <P>8.3 Velocity Determination.</P>

            <P>8.3.1 The velocities of exhaust gases from positive pressure baghouses are often too low to measure accurately with the type S pitot tube specified in Method 2 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> velocity head &lt;1.3 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.05 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O)). For these conditions, measure the gas flow rate at the fabric filter inlet following the procedures outlined in Method 2. Calculate the average gas velocity at the measurement site as shown in section 12.2 and use this average velocity in determining and maintaining isokinetic sampling rates.</P>

            <P>8.3.2 Velocity determinations to determine and maintain isokinetic rates at measurement sites with gas velocities within the range measurable with the type S pitot tube (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> velocity head greater than 1.3 mm H<E T="52">2</E>O (0.05 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O)) shall be conducted according to the procedures outlined in Method 2.</P>
            <P>8.4 Sampling. Follow the procedures specified in sections 8.1 through 8.6 of Method 5 or sections 8.1 through 8.25 in Method 17 with the exceptions as noted above.</P>
            <P>8.5 Sample Recovery. Follow the procedures specified in section 8.7 of Method 5 or section 8.2 of Method 17.</P>

            <P>Particulate matter is withdrawn isokinetically from the source and is collected either on a glass fiber filter maintained at a temperature in the range of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F) and in impingers in solutions of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The filtered particulate mass, which includes any material that condenses at or above the filtration temperature, is determined gravimetrically after the removal of uncombined water. The condensed PM collected in the impinger solutions is determined as total organic carbon (TOC) using a nondispersive infrared type of analyzer. The sum of the filtered PM mass and the condensed PM is reported as the total PM mass.</P>

            <P>Same as Method 5, section 10.0, with the addition of the following procedures for calibrating the total organic carbon analyzer:</P>
            <P>10.1 Preparation of Organic Carbon Standard Curve.</P>

            <P>10.1.1 Add 10 ml, 20 ml, 30 ml, 40 ml, and 50 ml of the organic carbon stock solution to a series of five 1000-ml volumetric flasks. Add 30 ml, 40 ml, and 50 ml of the same solution to a series of three 500-ml volumetric flasks. Dilute the contents of each flask to the mark using CO<E T="52">2</E>-free water. These flasks contain 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 mg/L organic carbon, respectively.</P>
            <P>10.1.2 Use a hypodermic syringe to withdraw a 20- to 50-µl aliquot from the 10 mg/L standard solution and inject it into the total carbon port of the analyzer. Measure the peak height. Repeat the injections until three consecutive peaks are obtained within 10 percent of their arithmetic mean. Repeat this procedure for the remaining organic carbon standard solutions.</P>
            <P>10.1.3 Calculate the corrected peak height for each standard by deducting the blank correction (see section 11.2.5.3) as follows:</P>
            <MATH DEEP="12" SPAN="2">
              <PRTPAGE P="209"/>
              <MID>ER17OC00.146</MID>
            </MATH>
            <FP>Where:</FP>
            
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">A = Peak height of standard or sample, mm or other appropriate unit.</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">B = Peak height of blank, mm or other appropriate unit.</FP>
            
            <P>10.1.4 Prepare a linear regression plot of the arithmetic mean of the three consecutive peak heights obtained for each standard solution against the concentration of that solution. Calculate the calibration factor as the inverse of the slope of this curve. If the product of the arithmetic mean peak height for any standard solution and the calibration factor differs from the actual concentration by more than 5 percent, remake and reanalyze that standard.</P>
            <P>10.2 Preparation of Inorganic Carbon Standard Curve. Repeat the procedures outlined in sections 10.1.1 through 10.1.4, substituting the inorganic carbon stock solution for the organic carbon stock solution, and the inorganic carbon port of the analyzer for the total carbon port.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>
            <P>11.1 Record the data required on a sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-6 of Method 5.</P>
            <P>11.2 Handle each sample container as follows:</P>
            <P>11.2.1 Container No. 1. Same as Method 5, section 11.2.1, except that the filters must be dried at 20 ±6 °C (68 ±10 °F) and ambient pressure.</P>
            <P>11.2.2 Containers No. 2 and No. 3. Same as Method 5, section 11.2.2, except that evaporation of the samples must be at 20 ±6 °C (68 ±10 °F) and ambient pressure.</P>
            <P>11.2.3 Container No. 4. Same as Method 5, section 11.2.3.</P>
            <P>11.2.4 “Water Blank” and “Acetone Blank” Containers. Determine the water and acetone blank values following the procedures for the “Acetone Blank” container in section 11.2.4 of Method 5. Evaporate the samples at ambient temperature (20 ±6 °C (68 ±10 °F)) and pressure.</P>

            <P>11.2.5 Container No. 5. For the determination of total organic carbon, perform two analyses on successive identical samples, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> total carbon and inorganic carbon. The desired quantity is the difference between the two values obtained. Both analyses are based on conversion of sample carbon into carbon dioxide for measurement by a nondispersive infrared analyzer. Results of analyses register as peaks on a strip chart recorder.</P>

            <P>11.2.5.1 The principal differences between the operating parameters for the two channels involve the combustion tube packing material and temperature. In the total carbon channel, a high temperature (950 °C (1740 °F)) furnace heats a Hastelloy combustion tube packed with cobalt oxide-impregnated asbestos fiber. The oxygen in the carrier gas, the elevated temperature, and the catalytic effect of the packing result in oxidation of both organic and inorganic carbonaceous material to CO<E T="52">2</E>, and steam. In the inorganic carbon channel, a low temperature (150 °C (300 °F)) furnace heats a glass tube containing quartz chips wetted with 85 percent phosphoric acid. The acid liberates CO<E T="52">2</E> and steam from inorganic carbonates. The operating temperature is below that required to oxidize organic matter. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for assembly, testing, calibration, and operation of the analyzer.</P>
            <P>11.2.5.2 As samples collected in 0.1 N NaOH often contain a high measure of inorganic carbon that inhibits repeatable determinations of TOC, sample pretreatment is necessary. Measure and record the liquid volume of each sample (or impinger contents). If the sample contains solids or immiscible liquid matter, homogenize the sample with a blender or ultrasonics until satisfactory repeatability is obtained. Transfer a representative portion of 10 to 15 ml to a 30-ml beaker, and acidify with about 2 drops of concentrated HCl to a pH of 2 or less. Warm the acidified sample at 50 °C (120 °F) in a water bath for 15 minutes.</P>
            <P>11.2.5.3 While stirring the sample with a magnetic stirrer, use a hypodermic syringe to withdraw a 20-to 50-µ1 aliquot from the beaker. Analyze the sample for total carbon and calculate its corrected mean peak height according to the procedures outlined in sections 10.1.2 and 10.1.3. Similarly analyze an aliquot of the sample for inorganic carbon. Repeat the analyses for all the samples and for the 0.1 N NaOH blank.</P>

            <P>11.2.5.4 Ascertain the total carbon and inorganic carbon concentrations (C<E T="52">TC</E> and C<E T="52">IC</E>, respectively) of each sample and blank by comparing the corrected mean peak heights for each sample and blank to the appropriate standard curve.

            <P>Same as Method 5, section 10.0, with the addition of the following:</P>

            <P>10.1 Determination of Ion Chromatograph Calibration Factor S. Prepare a series of five standards by adding 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 10.0 ml of working standard solution (25 µg/ml) to a series of five 50-ml volumetric flasks. (The standard masses will equal 25, 50, 100, 150, and 250 µg.) Dilute each flask to the mark with water, and mix well. Analyze each standard according to the chromatograph manufacturer's instructions. Take peak height measurements with symmetrical peaks; in all other cases, calculate peak areas. Prepare or calculate a linear regression plot of the standard masses in µg (x-axis) versus their responses (y-axis). From this line, or equation, determine the slope and calculate its reciprocal which is the calibration factor, S. If any point deviates from the line by more than 7 percent of the concentration at that point, remake and reanalyze that standard. This deviation can be determined by multiplying S times the response for each standard. The resultant concentrations must not differ by more than 7 percent from each known standard mass (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 25, 50, 100, 150, and 250 µg).</P>
            <P>10.2 Conductivity Detector. Calibrate according to manufacturer's specifications prior to initial use.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>
            <P>11.1 Sample Extraction.</P>
            <P>11.1.1 Note on the analytical data sheet, the level of the liquid in the container, and whether any sample was lost during shipment. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results.</P>
            <P>11.1.2 Cut the filter into small pieces, and place it in a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask with a ground glass joint equipped with an air condenser. Rinse the shipping container with water, and pour the rinse into the flask. Add additional water to the flask until it contains about 75 ml, and place the flask on a hot plate. Gently reflux the contents for 6 to 8 hours. Cool the solution, and transfer it to a 500-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the Erlenmeyer flask with water, and transfer the rinsings to the volumetric flask including the pieces of filter.</P>
            <P>11.1.3 Transfer the probe rinse to the same 500-ml volumetric flask with the filter sample. Rinse the sample bottle with water, and add the rinsings to the volumetric flask. Dilute the contents of the flask to the mark with water.</P>
            <P>11.1.4 Allow the contents of the flask to settle until all solid material is at the bottom of the flask. If necessary, remove and centrifuge a portion of the sample.</P>
            <P>11.1.5 Repeat the procedures outlined in sections 11.1.1 through 11.1.4 for each sample and for the filter blank.</P>
            <P>11.2 Sulfate (SO<E T="52">4</E>) Analysis.</P>
            <P>11.2.1 Prepare a standard calibration curve according to the procedures outlined in section 10.1.</P>
            <P>11.2.2 Pipet 5 ml of the sample into a 50-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to 50 ml with water. (Alternatively, eluent solution may be used instead of water in all sample, standard, and blank dilutions.) Analyze the set of standards followed by the set of samples, including the filter blank, using the same injection volume used for the standards.</P>
            <P>11.2.3 Repeat the analyses of the standards and the samples, with the standard set being done last. The two peak height or peak area responses for each sample must agree within 5 percent of their arithmetic mean for the analysis to be valid. Perform this analysis sequence on the same day. Dilute any sample and the blank with equal volumes of water if the concentration exceeds that of the highest standard.</P>
            <P>11.2.4 Document each sample chromatogram by listing the following analytical parameters: injection point, injection volume, sulfate retention time, flow rate, detector sensitivity setting, and recorder chart speed.</P>
            <P>11.3 Sample Residue.</P>
            <P>11.3.1 Transfer the remaining contents of the volumetric flask to a tared 600-ml beaker or similar container. Rinse the volumetric flask with water, and add the rinsings to the tared beaker. Make certain that all particulate matter is transferred to the beaker. Evaporate the water in an oven at 105 °C (220 °F) until only about 100 ml of water remains. Remove the beakers from the oven, and allow them to cool.</P>
            <P>11.3.2 After the beakers have cooled, add five drops of phenolphthalein indicator, and then add concentrated ammonium hydroxide until the solution turns pink. Return the samples to the oven at 105 °C (220 °F), and evaporate the samples to dryness. Cool the samples in a desiccator, and weigh the samples to constant weight.</P>

Stop collection of the eluate when the volume in the flask reaches 50-ml. Pipette a 20-ml aliquot of the eluate into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 80 ml of 100 percent isopropanol and two to four drops of thorin indicator, and titrate to a pink end point using 0.0100 N barium perchlorate. Repeat and average the titration volumes. Run a blank with each series of samples. Replicate titrations must agree within 1 percent or 0.2 ml, whichever is larger. Perform the ion exchange and titration procedures on duplicate portions of the filtrate. Results should agree within 5 percent. Regenerate or replace the ion exchange resin after 20 sample aliquots have been analyzed or if the end point of the titration becomes unclear.

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage</HD>
            <P>8.1 Dilution Tunnel Assembly and Cleaning. A schematic of a dilution tunnel is shown in Figure 5G-2. The dilution tunnel dimensions and other features are described in section 6.1.4. Assemble the dilution tunnel, sealing joints and seams to prevent air leakage. Clean the dilution tunnel with an appropriately sized wire chimney brush before each certification test.</P>

            <P>8.2 Draft Determination. Prepare the wood heater as in Method 28, section 6.2.1. Locate the dilution tunnel hood centrally over the wood heater stack exhaust. Operate the dilution tunnel blower at the flow rate to be used during the test run. Measure the draft imposed on the wood heater by the dilution tunnel (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the difference in draft measured with and without the dilution tunnel operating) as described in Method 28, section 6.2.3. Adjust the distance between the top of the wood heater stack exhaust and the dilution tunnel hood so that the dilution tunnel induced draft is less than 1.25 Pa (0.005 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O). Have no fire in the wood heater, close the wood heater doors, and open fully the air supply controls during this check and adjustment.</P>
            <P>8.3 Pretest Ignition. Same as Method 28, section 8.7.</P>
            <P>8.4 Smoke Capture. During the pretest ignition period, operate the dilution tunnel and visually monitor the wood heater stack exhaust. Operate the wood heater with the doors closed and determine that 100 percent of the exhaust gas is collected by the dilution tunnel hood. If less than 100 percent of the wood heater exhaust gas is collected, adjust the distance between the wood heater stack and the dilution tunnel hood until no visible exhaust gas is escaping. Stop the pretest ignition period, and repeat the draft determination procedure described in section 8.2.</P>

            <P>8.5 Velocity Measurements. During the pretest ignition period, conduct a velocity traverse to identify the point of average velocity. This single point shall be used for measuring velocity during the test run.<PRTPAGE P="217"/>
            </P>

            <P>8.5.1 Velocity Traverse. Measure the diameter of the duct at the velocity traverse port location through both ports. Calculate the duct area using the average of the two diameters. A pretest leak-check of pitot lines as in Method 2, section 8.1, is recommended. Place the calibrated pitot tube at the centroid of the stack in either of the velocity traverse ports. Adjust the damper or similar device on the blower inlet until the velocity indicated by the pitot is approximately 220 m/min (720 ft/min). Continue to read the Δp and temperature until the velocity has remained constant (less than 5 percent change) for 1 minute. Once a constant velocity is obtained at the centroid of the duct, perform a velocity traverse as outlined in Method 2, section 8.3 using four points per traverse as outlined in Method 1. Measure the Δp and tunnel temperature at each traverse point and record the readings. Calculate the total gas flow rate using calculations contained in Method 2, section 12. Verify that the flow rate is 4 ±0.40 dscm/min (140 ±14 dscf/min); if not, readjust the damper, and repeat the velocity traverse. The moisture may be assumed to be 4 percent (100 percent relative humidity at 85 °F). Direct moisture measurements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> according to Method 4) are also permissible.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>If burn rates exceed 3 kg/hr (6.6 lb/hr), dilution tunnel duct flow rates greater than 4 dscm/min (140 dscfm) and sampling section duct diameters larger than 150 mm (6 in.) are allowed. If larger ducts or flow rates are used, the sampling section velocity shall be at least 220 m/min (720 fpm). In order to ensure measurable particulate mass catch, it is recommended that the ratio of the average mass flow rate in the dilution tunnel to the average fuel burn rate be less than 150:1 if larger duct sizes or flow rates are used.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.5.2 Testing Velocity Measurements. After obtaining velocity traverse results that meet the flow rate requirements, choose a point of average velocity and place the pitot and temperature sensor at that location in the duct. Alternatively, locate the pitot and the temperature sensor at the duct centroid and calculate a velocity correction factor for the centroidal position. Mount the pitot to ensure no movement during the test run and seal the port holes to prevent any air leakage. Align the pitot opening to be parallel with the duct axis at the measurement point. Check that this condition is maintained during the test run (about 30-minute intervals). Monitor the temperature and velocity during the pretest ignition period to ensure that the proper flow rate is maintained. Make adjustments to the dilution tunnel flow rate as necessary.</P>
            <P>8.6 Pretest Preparation. Same as Method 5, section 8.1.</P>
            <P>8.7 Preparation of Sampling Train. During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep all openings where contamination can occur covered until just prior to assembly or until sampling is about to begin.</P>
            <P>Using a tweezer or clean disposable surgical gloves, place one labeled (identified) and weighed filter in each of the filter holders. Be sure that each filter is properly centered and that the gasket is properly placed so as to prevent the sample gas stream from circumventing the filter. Check each filter for tears after assembly is completed.</P>
            <P>Mark the probe with heat resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct. Set up the train as shown in Figure 5G-1.</P>
            <P>8.8 Leak-Check Procedures.</P>

            <P>8.8.1 Leak-Check of Metering System Shown in Figure 5G-1. That portion of the sampling train from the pump to the orifice meter shall be leak-checked prior to initial use and after each certification or audit test. Leakage after the pump will result in less volume being recorded than is actually sampled. Use the procedure described in Method 5, section 8.4.1. Similar leak-checks shall be conducted for other types of metering systems (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> without orifice meters).</P>
            <P>8.8.2 Pretest Leak-Check. A pretest leak-check of the sampling train is recommended, but not required. If the pretest leak check is conducted, the procedures outlined in Method 5, section 8.4.2 should be used. A vacuum of 130 mm Hg (5 in. Hg) may be used instead of 380 mm Hg (15 in. Hg).</P>
            <P>8.8.3 Post-Test Leak-Check. A leak-check of the sampling train is mandatory at the conclusion of each test run. The leak-check shall be performed in accordance with the procedures outlined in Method 5, section 8.4.2. A vacuum of 130 mm Hg (5 in. Hg) or the highest vacuum measured during the test run, whichever is greater, may be used instead of 380 mm Hg (15 in. Hg).</P>
            <P>8.9 Preliminary Determinations. Determine the pressure, temperature and the average velocity of the tunnel gases as in section 8.5. Moisture content of diluted tunnel gases is assumed to be 4 percent for making flow rate calculations; the moisture content may be measured directly as in Method 4.</P>
            <P>8.10 Sampling Train Operation. Position the probe inlet at the stack centroid, and block off the openings around the probe and porthole to prevent unrepresentative dilution of the gas stream. Be careful not to bump the probe into the stack wall when removing or inserting the probe through the porthole; this minimizes the chance of extracting deposited material.</P>

            <P>8.10.1 Begin sampling at the start of the test run as defined in Method 28, section 8.8.1. During the test run, maintain a sample flow rate proportional to the dilution tunnel flow rate (within 10 percent of the initial proportionality ratio) and a filter holder temperature of no greater than 32 °C (90 °F). <PRTPAGE P="218"/>The initial sample flow rate shall be approximately 0.015 m<SU>3</SU>/min (0.5 cfm).</P>
            <P>8.10.2 For each test run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5G-3. Be sure to record the initial dry gas meter reading. Record the dry gas meter readings at the beginning and end of each sampling time increment and when sampling is halted. Take other readings as indicated on Figure 5G-3 at least once each 10 minutes during the test run. Since the manometer level and zero may drift because of vibrations and temperature changes, make periodic checks during the test run.</P>
            <P>8.10.3 For the purposes of proportional sampling rate determinations, data from calibrated flow rate devices, such as glass rotameters, may be used in lieu of incremental dry gas meter readings. Proportional rate calculation procedures must be revised, but acceptability limits remain the same.</P>
            <P>8.10.4 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the temperature between (or upstream of) the filters at the proper level. Do not change sampling trains during the test run.</P>
            <P>8.10.5 At the end of the test run (see Method 28, section 6.4.6), turn off the coarse adjust valve, remove the probe from the stack, turn off the pump, record the final dry gas meter reading, and conduct a post-test leak-check, as outlined in section 8.8.2. Also, leak-check the pitot lines as described in Method 2, section 8.1; the lines must pass this leak-check in order to validate the velocity head data.</P>
            <P>8.11 Calculation of Proportional Sampling Rate. Calculate percent proportionality (see section 12.7) to determine whether the run was valid or another test run should be made.</P>
            <P>8.12 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, section 8.7, with the exception of the following:</P>
            <P>8.12.1 An acetone blank volume of about 50-ml or more may be used.</P>
            <P>8.12.2 Treat the samples as follows:</P>
            <P>8.12.2.1 Container Nos. 1 and 1A. Treat the two filters according to the procedures outlined in Method 5, section 8.7.6.1. The filters may be stored either in a single container or in separate containers. Use the sum of the filter tare weights to determine the sample mass collected.</P>
            <P>8.12.2.3 Container No. 2.</P>
            <P>8.12.2.3.1 Taking care to see that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover particulate matter or any condensate from the probe and filter holders by washing and brushing these components with acetone and placing the wash in a labeled glass container. At least three cycles of brushing and rinsing are required.</P>
            <P>8.12.2.3.2 Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination.</P>
            <P>8.12.2.3.3 After all acetone washings and particulate matter have been collected in the sample containers, tighten the lids on the sample containers so that the acetone will not leak out when transferred to the laboratory weighing area. Mark the height of the fluid levels to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the containers clearly to identify contents.</P>

            <P>8.13 Sample Transport. Whenever possible, containers should be shipped in such a way that they remain upright at all times.

            <P>16.1 Method 5H Sampling Train. The sampling train and sample collection, recovery, and analysis procedures described in Method 5H, sections 6.1.1, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.10, 8.11, and 11.0, respectively, may be used in lieu of similar sections in Method 5G. Operation of the Method 5H sampling train in the dilution tunnel is as described in section 8.10 of this method. Filter temperatures and condenser conditions are as described in Method 5H. No adjustment to the measured particulate matter emission rate (Equation 5G-4, section 12.6) is to be applied to the particulate emission rate measured by this alternative method.</P>

            <P>16.2 Dual Sampling Trains. Two sampling trains may be operated simultaneously at sample flow rates other than that specified <PRTPAGE P="221"/>in section 8.10, provided that the following specifications are met.</P>
            <P>16.2.1 Sampling Train. The sampling train configuration shall be the same as specified in section 6.1.1, except the probe, filter, and filter holder need not be the same sizes as specified in the applicable sections. Filter holders of plastic materials such as Nalgene or polycarbonate materials may be used (the Gelman 1119 filter holder has been found suitable for this purpose). With such materials, it is recommended that solvents not be used in sample recovery. The filter face velocity shall not exceed 150 mm/sec (30 ft/min) during the test run. The dry gas meter shall be calibrated for the same flow rate range as encountered during the test runs. Two separate, complete sampling trains are required for each test run.</P>
            <P>16.2.2 Probe Location. Locate the two probes in the dilution tunnel at the same level (see section 6.1.4.3). Two sample ports are necessary. Locate the probe inlets within the 50 mm (2 in.) diameter centroidal area of the dilution tunnel no closer than 25 mm (1 in.) apart.</P>
            <P>16.2.3 Sampling Train Operation. Operate the sampling trains as specified in section 8.10, maintaining proportional sampling rates and starting and stopping the two sampling trains simultaneously. The pitot values as described in section 8.5.2 shall be used to adjust sampling rates in both sampling trains.</P>
            <P>16.2.4 Recovery and Analysis of Sample. Recover and analyze the samples from the two sampling trains separately, as specified in sections 8.12 and 11.0, respectively.</P>
            <P>16.2.4.1 For this alternative procedure, the probe and filter holder assembly may be weighed without sample recovery (use no solvents) described above in order to determine the sample weight gains. For this approach, weigh the clean, dry probe and filter holder assembly upstream of the front filter (without filters) to the nearest 0.1 mg to establish the tare weights. The filter holder section between the front and second filter need not be weighed. At the end of the test run, carefully clean the outside of the probe, cap the ends, and identify the sample (label). Remove the filters from the filter holder assemblies as described for container Nos. 1 and 1A in section 8.12.2.1. Reassemble the filter holder assembly, cap the ends, identify the sample (label), and transfer all the samples to the laboratory weighing area for final weighing. Requirements for capping and transport of sample containers are not applicable if sample recovery and analysis occur in the same room.</P>
            <P>16.2.4.2 For this alternative procedure, filters may be weighed directly without a petri dish. If the probe and filter holder assembly are to be weighed to determine the sample weight, rinse the probe with acetone to remove moisture before desiccating prior to the test run. Following the test run, transport the probe and filter holder to the desiccator, and uncap the openings of the probe and the filter holder assembly. Desiccate for 24 hours and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg.</P>
            <P>16.2.5 Calculations. Calculate an emission rate (Section 12.6) for the sample from each sampling train separately and determine the average emission rate for the two values. The two emission rates shall not differ by more than 7.5 percent from the average emission rate, or 7.5 percent of the weighted average emission rate limit in the applicable subpart of the regulations, whichever is greater. If this specification is not met, the results are unacceptable. Report the results, but do not include the results in calculating the weighted average emission rate. Repeat the test run until acceptable results are achieved, report the average emission rate for the acceptable test run, and use the average in calculating the weighted average emission rate.</P>

            <P>8.6.1 SO<E T="52">2</E> Injection Probe. Install the SO<E T="52">2</E> injection probe and dispersion loop in the stack at a location 2.9 ±0.15 m (9.5 ±0.5 ft) above the sampling platform.</P>
            <P>8.6.2 SO<E T="52">2</E> Sampling Probe. Install the SO<E T="52">2</E> sampling probe at the centroid of the stack at a location 4.1 ±0.15 m (13.5 ±0.5 ft) above the sampling platform.</P>

            <P>8.8 Tracer Gas Procedure. Within 1 minute after closing the wood heater door at the start of the test run (as defined in Method 28, section 8.8.1), meter a known concentration of SO<E T="52">2</E> tracer gas at a constant flow rate into the wood heater stack. Monitor the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration in the stack, and record the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations at 10-minute intervals or more often. Adjust the particulate sampling flow rate proportionally to the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration changes using Equation 5H-6 (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration at the first 10-minute reading is measured to be 100 ppm; the next 10 minute SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration is measured to be 75 ppm: the particulate sample flow rate is adjusted from the initial 0.15 cfm to 0.20 cfm). A check for proportional rate variation shall be made at the completion of the test run using Equation 5H-10.</P>
            <P>8.9 Volumetric Flow Rate Procedure. Apply stoichiometric relationships to the wood combustion process in determining the exhaust gas flow rate as follows:</P>
            <P>8.9.1 Test Fuel Charge Weight. Record the test fuel charge weight (wet) as specified in Method 28, section 8.8.2. The wood is assumed to have the following weight percent composition: 51 percent carbon, 7.3 percent hydrogen, 41 percent oxygen. Record the wood moisture for each fuel charge as described in Method 28, section 8.6.5. The ash is assumed to have negligible effect on associated C, H, and O concentrations after the test burn.</P>
            <P>8.9.2 Measured Values. Record the CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations in the stack on a dry basis every 10 minutes during the test run or more often. Average these values for the test run. Use as a mole fraction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 10 percent CO<E T="52">2</E> is recorded as 0.10) in the calculations to express total flow (see Equation 5H-6).</P>
            <P>8.10 Sampling Train Operation.</P>
            <P>8.10.1 For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5H-3. Be sure to record the initial dry gas meter reading. Record the dry gas meter readings at the beginning and end of each sampling time increment, when changes in flow rates are made, before and after each leak-check, and when sampling is halted. Take other readings as indicated on Figure 5H-3 at least once each 10 minutes during the test run.</P>
            <P>8.10.2 Remove the nozzle cap, verify that the filter and probe heating systems are up to temperature, and that the probe is properly positioned. Position the nozzle, if used, facing into gas stream, or the probe tip in the 50 mm (2 in.) centroidal area of the stack.</P>
            <P>8.10.3 Be careful not to bump the probe tip into the stack wall when removing or inserting the probe through the porthole; this minimizes the chance of extracting deposited material.</P>
            <P>8.10.4 When the probe is in position, block off the openings around the probe and porthole to prevent unrepresentative dilution of the gas stream.</P>
            <P>8.10.5 Begin sampling at the start of the test run as defined in Method 28, section 8.8.1, start the sample pump, and adjust the sample flow rate to between 0.003 and 0.014 m<SU>3</SU>/min (0.1 and 0.5 cfm). Adjust the sample flow rate proportionally to the stack gas flow during the test run according to the procedures outlined in section 8. Maintain a proportional sampling rate (within 10 percent of the desired value) and a filter holder temperature no greater than 120 °C (248 °F).</P>
            <P>8.10.6 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the temperature around the filter holder at the proper level. Add more ice to the impinger box and, if necessary, salt to maintain a temperature of less than 20 °C (68 °F) at the condenser/silica gel outlet.</P>
            <P>8.10.7 If the pressure drop across the filter becomes too high, making proportional sampling difficult to maintain, either filter may be replaced during a sample run. It is recommended that another complete filter assembly be used rather than attempting to change the filter itself. Before a new filter assembly is installed, conduct a leak-check (see section 8.5.2). The total particulate weight shall include the summation of all filter assembly catches. The total time for changing sample train components shall not exceed 10 minutes. No more than one component change is allowed for any test run.</P>
            <P>8.10.8 At the end of the test run, turn off the coarse adjust valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, record the final dry gas meter reading, and conduct a post-test leak-check, as outlined in section 8.5.3.</P>

            <P>8.11.1 Blanks. The volume of the acetone blank may be about 50-ml, rather than 200-ml; a 200-ml water blank shall also be saved for analysis.</P>
            <P>8.11.2 Samples.</P>

            <P>8.11.2.1 Container Nos. 1 and 1A. Treat the two filters according to the procedures outlined in Method 5, section 8.7.6.1. The filters <PRTPAGE P="229"/>may be stored either in a single container or in separate containers.</P>
            <P>8.11.2.2 Container No. 2. Same as Method 5, section 8.7.6.2, except that the container should not be sealed until the impinger rinse solution is added (see section 8.10.2.4).</P>
            <P>8.11.2.3 Container No. 3. Treat the impingers as follows: Measure the liquid which is in the first three impingers to within 1-ml by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to within 0.5 g by using a balance (if one is available). Record the volume or weight of liquid present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. Transfer the water from the first, second, and third impingers to a glass container. Tighten the lid on the sample container so that water will not leak out.</P>
            <P>8.11.2.4 Rinse impingers and graduated cylinder, if used, with acetone three times or more. Avoid direct contact between the acetone and any stopcock grease or collection of any stopcock grease in the rinse solutions. Add these rinse solutions to sample Container No. 2.</P>

Determination of sample leakage is not applicable if sample recovery and analysis occur in the same room. Measure the liquid in this container either volumetrically to within 1-ml or gravimetrically to within 0.5 g. Transfer the contents to a 500-ml or larger separatory funnel. Rinse the container with water, and add to the separatory funnel. Add 25-ml of dichloromethane to the separatory funnel, stopper and vigorously shake 1 minute, let separate and transfer the dichloromethane (lower layer) into a tared beaker or evaporating dish. Repeat twice more. It is necessary to rinse Container No. 3 with dichloromethane. This rinse is added to the impinger extract container. Transfer the remaining water from the separatory funnel to a tared beaker or evaporating dish and evaporate to dryness at 104 °C (220 °F). Desiccate and weigh to a constant weight. Evaporate the combined impinger water extracts at ambient temperature and pressure. Desiccate and weigh to a constant weight. Report both results to the nearest 0.1 mg.</P>

              <P>This method does not include all of the specifications (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> equipment and supplies) and procedures (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Certain information is contained in other EPA procedures found in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have experience with and a thorough knowledge of the following Methods: Methods 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Scope and Application.</HD>

            <P>1.1 Analyte. Particulate matter (PM). No CAS number assigned.<PRTPAGE P="237"/>
            </P>
            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of low level particulate matter (PM) emissions from stationary sources. The method is most effective for total PM catches of 50 mg or less. This method was initially developed for performing correlation of manual PM measurements to PM continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS), however it is also useful for other low particulate concentration applications.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods. Method 5I requires the use of paired trains. Acceptance criteria for the identification of data quality outliers from the paired trains are provided in section 12.2 of this Method.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Summary of Method.</HD>
            <P>2.1. Description. The system setup and operation is essentially identical to Method 5. Particulate is withdrawn isokinetically from the source and collected on a 47 mm glass fiber filter maintained at a temperature of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F). The PM mass is determined by gravimetric analysis after the removal of uncombined water. Specific measures in this procedure designed to improve system performance at low particulate levels include:</P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. Improved sample handling procedures</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2 Light weight sample filter assembly</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. Use of low residue grade acetone</FP>
            <FP>Accuracy is improved through the minimization of systemic errors associated with sample handling and weighing procedures. High purity reagents, all glass, grease free, sample train components, and light weight filter assemblies and beakers, each contribute to the overall objective of improved precision and accuracy at low particulate concentrations.</FP>
            <P>2.2 Paired Trains. This method must be performed using a paired train configuration. These trains may be operated as co-located trains (to trains operating collecting from one port) or as simultaneous trains (separate trains operating from different ports at the same time). Procedures for calculating precision of the paired trains are provided in section 12.</P>
            <P>2.3 Detection Limit. a. Typical detection limit for manual particulate testing is 0.5 mg. This mass is also cited as the accepted weight variability limit in determination of “constant weight” as cited in section 8.1.2 of this Method. EPA has performed studies to provide guidance on minimum PM catch. The minimum detection limit (MDL) is the minimum concentration or amount of an analyte that can be determined with a specified degree of confidence to be different from zero. We have defined the minimum or target catch as a concentration or amount sufficiently larger than the MDL to ensure that the results are reliable and repeatable. The particulate matter catch is the product of the average particulate matter concentration on a mass per volume basis and the volume of gas collected by the sample train. The tester can generally control the volume of gas collected by increasing the sampling time or to a lesser extent by increasing the rate at which sample is collected. If the tester has a reasonable estimate of the PM concentration from the source, the tester can ensure that the target catch is collected by sampling the appropriate gas volume.</P>
            <P>b. However, if the source has a very low particulate matter concentration in the stack, the volume of gas sampled may need to be very large which leads to unacceptably long sampling times. When determining compliance with an emission limit, EPA guidance has been that the tester does not always have to collect the target catch. Instead, we have suggested that the tester sample enough stack gas, that if the source were exactly at the level of the emission standard, the sample catch would equal the target catch. Thus, if at the end of the test the catch were smaller than the target, we could still conclude that the source is in compliance though we might not know the exact emission level. This volume of gas becomes a target volume that can be translated into a target sampling time by assuming an average sampling rate. Because the MDL forms the basis for our guidance on target sampling times, EPA has conducted a systematic laboratory study to define what is the MDL for Method 5 and determined the Method to have a calculated practical quantitation limit (PQL) of 3 mg of PM and an MDL of 1 mg.</P>
            <P>c. Based on these results, the EPA has concluded that for PM testing, the target catch must be no less than 3 mg. Those sample catches between 1 mg and 3 mg are between the detection limit and the limit of quantitation. If a tester uses the target catch to estimate a target sampling time that results in sample catches that are less than 3 mg, you should not automatically reject the results. If the tester calculated the target sampling time as described above by assuming that the source was at the level of the emission limit, the results would still be valid for determining that the source was in compliance. For purposes other than determining compliance, results should be divided into two categories—those that fall between 3 mg and 1 mg and those that are below 1 mg. A sample catch between 1 and 3 mg may be used for such purposes as calculating emission rates with the understanding that the resulting emission rates can have a high degree of uncertainty. Results of less than 1 mg should not be used for calculating emission rates or pollutant concentrations.</P>

            <P>d. When collecting small catches such as 3 mg, bias becomes an important issue. Source testers must use extreme caution to reach the PQL of 3 mg by assuring that sampling <PRTPAGE P="238"/>probes are very clean (perhaps confirmed by low blank weights) before use in the field. They should also use low tare weight sample containers, and establish a well-controlled balance room to weigh the samples.</P>

            <P>a. There are numerous potential interferents that may be encountered during performance of Method 5I sampling and analyses. This Method should be considered more sensitive to the normal interferents typically encountered during particulate testing because of the low level concentrations of the flue gas stream being sampled.</P>
            <P>b. Care must be taken to minimize field contamination, especially to the filter housing since the entire unit is weighed (not just the filter media). Care must also be taken to ensure that no sample is lost during the sampling process (such as during port changes, removal of the filter assemblies from the probes, etc.).</P>
            <P>c. Balance room conditions are a source of concern for analysis of the low level samples. Relative humidity, ambient temperatures variations, air draft, vibrations and even barometric pressure can affect consistent reproducible measurements of the sample media. Ideally, the same analyst who performs the tare weights should perform the final weights to minimize the effects of procedural differences specific to the analysts.</P>
            <P>d. Attention must also be provided to weighing artifacts caused by electrostatic charges which may have to be discharged or neutralized prior to sample analysis. Static charge can affect consistent and reliable gravimetric readings in low humidity environments. Method 5I recommends a relative humidity of less than 50 percent in the weighing room environment used for sample analyses. However, lower humidity may be encountered or required to address sample precision problems. Low humidity conditions can increase the effects of static charge.</P>
            <P>e. Other interferences associated with typical Method 5 testing (sulfates, acid gases, etc.) are also applicable to Method 5I.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Safety.</HD>
            <P>Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety concerns associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability and observe all regulatory limitations before using this method.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. Equipment and Supplies.</HD>
            <P>6.1 Sample Collection Equipment and Supplies. The sample train is nearly identical in configuration to the train depicted in Figure 5-1 of Method 5. The primary difference in the sample trains is the lightweight Method 5I filter assembly that attaches directly to the exit to the probe. Other exceptions and additions specific to Method 5I include:</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Probe Nozzle. Same as Method 5, with the exception that it must be constructed of borosilicate or quartz glass tubing.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Probe Liner. Same as Method 5, with the exception that it must be constructed of borosilicate or quartz glass tubing.</P>
            <P>6.1.3 Filter Holder. The filter holder is constructed of borosilicate or quartz glass front cover designed to hold a 47-mm glass fiber filter, with a wafer thin stainless steel (SS) filter support, a silicone rubber or Viton O-ring, and Teflon tape seal. This holder design will provide a positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter. The filter holder assembly fits into a SS filter holder and attaches directly to the outlet of the probe. The tare weight of the filter, borosilicate or quartz glass holder, SS filter support, O-ring and Teflon tape seal generally will not exceed approximately 35 grams. The filter holder is designed to use a 47-mm glass fiber filter meeting the quality criteria in of Method 5. These units are commercially available from several source testing equipment vendors. Once the filter holder has been assembled, desiccated and tared, protect it from external sources of contamination by covering the front socket with a ground glass plug. Secure the plug with an impinger clamp or other item that will ensure a leak-free fitting.</P>
            <P>6.2 Sample Recovery Equipment and Supplies. Same as Method 5, with the following exceptions:</P>
            <P>6.2.1 Probe-Liner and Probe-Nozzle Brushes. Teflon or nylon bristle brushes with stainless steel wire handles, should be used to clean the probe. The probe brush must have extensions (at least as long as the probe) of Teflon, nylon or similarly inert material. The brushes must be properly sized and shaped for brushing out the probe liner and nozzle.</P>

            <P>6.2.2 Wash Bottles. Two Teflon wash bottles are recommended however, polyethylene wash bottles may be used at the option of the tester. Acetone should not be stored in polyethylene bottles for longer than one month.<PRTPAGE P="239"/>
            </P>
            <P>6.2.3 Filter Assembly Transport. A system should be employed to minimize contamination of the filter assemblies during transport to and from the field test location. A carrying case or packet with clean compartments of sufficient size to accommodate each filter assembly can be used. This system should have an air tight seal to further minimize contamination during transport to and from the field.</P>
            <P>6.3 Analysis Equipment and Supplies. Same as Method 5, with the following exception:</P>
            <P>6.3.1 Lightweight Beaker Liner. Teflon or other lightweight beaker liners are used for the analysis of the probe and nozzle rinses. These light weight liners are used in place of the borosilicate glass beakers typically used for the Method 5 weighings in order to improve sample analytical precision.</P>
            <P>6.3.2 Anti-static Treatment. Commercially available gaseous anti-static rinses are recommended for low humidity situations that contribute to static charge problems.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7. Reagents and Standards.</HD>
            <P>7.1 Sampling Reagents. The reagents used in sampling are the same as Method 5 with the following exceptions:</P>
            <P>7.1.1 Filters. The quality specifications for the filters are identical to those cited for Method 5. The only difference is the filter diameter of 47 millimeters.</P>
            <P>7.1.2 Stopcock Grease. Stopcock grease cannot be used with this sampling train. We recommend that the sampling train be assembled with glass joints containing O-ring seals or screw-on connectors, or similar.</P>
            <P>7.1.3 Acetone. Low residue type acetone, ≤0.001 percent residue, purchased in glass bottles is used for the recovery of particulate matter from the probe and nozzle. Acetone from metal containers generally has a high residue blank and should not be used. Sometimes, suppliers transfer acetone to glass bottles from metal containers; thus, acetone blanks must be run prior to field use and only acetone with low blank values (≤0.001 percent residue, as specified by the manufacturer) must be used. Acetone blank correction is not allowed for this method; therefore, it is critical that high purity reagents be purchased and verified prior to use.</P>
            <P>7.1.4 Gloves. Disposable, powder-free, latex surgical gloves, or their equivalent are used at all times when handling the filter housings or performing sample recovery.</P>
            <P>7.2 Standards. There are no applicable standards commercially available for Method 5I analyses.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8. Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport.</HD>
            <P>8.1 Pretest Preparation. Same as Method 5 with several exceptions specific to filter assembly and weighing.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Filter Assembly. Uniquely identify each filter support before loading filters into the holder assembly. This can be done with an engraving tool or a permanent marker. Use powder free latex surgical gloves whenever handling the filter holder assemblies. Place the O-ring on the back of the filter housing in the O-ring groove. Place a 47 mm glass fiber filter on the O-ring with the face down. Place a stainless steel filter holder against the back of the filter. Carefully wrap 5 mm (<FR>1/4</FR> inch) wide Teflon” tape one timearound the outside of the filter holder overlapping the stainless steel filter support by approximately 2.5 mm (<FR>1/8</FR> inch). Gently brush the Teflon tape down on the back of the stainless steel filter support. Store the filter assemblies in their transport case until time for weighing or field use.</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Filter Weighing Procedures. a. Desiccate the entire filter holder assemblies at 20 ±5.6 °C (68 ±10 °F) and ambient pressure for at least 24 hours. Weigh at intervals of at least 6 hours to a constant weight, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> 0.5 mg change from previous weighing. Record the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. During each weighing, the filter holder assemblies must not be exposed to the laboratory atmosphere for a period greater than 2 minutes and a relative humidity above 50 percent. Lower relative humidity may be required in order to improve analytical precision. However, low humidity conditions increase static charge to the sample media.</P>
            <P>b. Alternatively (unless otherwise specified by the Administrator), the filters holder assemblies may be oven dried at 105 °C (220 °F) for a minimum of 2 hours, desiccated for 2 hours, and weighed. The procedure used for the tare weigh must also be used for the final weight determination.</P>
            <P>c. Experience has shown that weighing uncertainties are not only related to the balance performance but to the entire weighing procedure. Therefore, before performing any measurement, establish and follow standard operating procedures, taking into account the sampling equipment and filters to be used.</P>
            <P>8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Select the sampling site, traverse points, probe nozzle, and probe length as specified in Method 5.</P>
            <P>8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as Method 5, section 8.3, with the following exception: During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep all openings where contamination can occur covered until justbefore assembly or until sampling is about to begin. Using gloves, place a labeled (identified) and weighed filter holder assembly into the stainless steel holder. Then place this whole unit in the Method 5 hot box, and attach it to the probe. Do not use stopcock grease.</P>
            <P>8.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Same as Method 5.</P>
            <P>8.5 Sampling Train Operation.<PRTPAGE P="240"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.5.1. Operation. Operate the sampling train in a manner consistent with those described in Methods 1, 2, 4 and 5 in terms of the number of sample points and minimum time per point. The sample rate and total gas volume should be adjusted based on estimated grain loading of the source being characterized. The total sampling time must be a function of the estimated mass of particulate to be collected for the run. Targeted mass to be collected in a typical Method 5I sample train should be on the order of 10 to 20 mg. Method 5I is most appropriate for total collected masses of less than 50 milligrams, however, there is not an exact particulate loading cutoff, and it is likely that some runs may exceed 50 mg. Exceeding 50 mg (or less than 10 mg) for the sample mass does not necessarily justify invalidating a sample run if all other Method criteria are met.</P>
            <P>8.5.2 Paired Train. This Method requires PM samples be collected with paired trains.</P>
            <P>8.5.2.1 It is important that the systems be operated truly simultaneously. This implies that both sample systems start and stop at the same times. This also means that if one sample system is stopped during the run, the other sample systems must also be stopped until the cause has been corrected.</P>
            <P>8.5.2.2 Care should be taken to maintain the filter box temperature of the paired trains as close as possible to the Method required temperature of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F). If separate ovens are being used for simultaneously operated trains, it is recommended that the oven temperature of each train be maintained within ±14 °C (±25 °F) of each other.</P>
            <P>8.5.2.3 The nozzles for paired trains need not be identically sized.</P>
            <P>8.5.2.4 Co-located sample nozzles must be within the same plane perpendicular to the gas flow. Co-located nozzles and pitot assemblies should be within a 6.0 cm × 6.0 cm square (as cited for a quadruple train in Reference Method 301).</P>
            <P>8.5.3 Duplicate gas samples for molecular weight determination need not be collected.</P>
            <P>8.6 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5 with several exceptions specific to the filter housing.</P>
            <P>8.6.1 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the train and seal the nozzle inlet and outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Cap the filter inlet using a standard ground glass plug and secure the cap with an impinger clamp. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used between the first impinger condenser and the filter holder, disconnect the line at the filter holder and let any condensed water or liquid drain into the impingers or condenser.</P>
            <P>8.6.2 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This area must be clean and protected from the wind so that the possibility of losing any of the sample will be minimized.</P>
            <P>8.6.3 Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and note any abnormal conditions such as particulate color, filter loading, impinger liquid color, etc.</P>
            <P>8.6.4 Container No. 1, Filter Assembly. Carefully remove the cooled filter holder assembly from the Method 5 hot box and place it in the transport case. Use a pair of clean gloves to handle the filter holder assembly.</P>
            <P>8.6.5 Container No. 2, Probe Nozzle and Probe Liner Rinse. Rinse the probe and nozzle components with acetone. Be certain that the probe and nozzle brushes have been thoroughly rinsed prior to use as they can be a source of contamination.</P>
            <P>8.6.6 All Other Train Components. (Impingers) Same as Method 5.</P>
            <P>8.7 Sample Storage and Transport. Whenever possible, containers should be shipped in such a way that they remain upright at all times. All appropriate dangerous goods shipping requirements must be observed since acetone is a flammable liquid.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9. Quality Control.</HD>
            <P>9.1 Miscellaneous Field Quality Control Measures.</P>
            <P>9.1.1 A quality control (QC) check of the volume metering system at the field site is suggested before collecting the sample using the procedures in Method 5, section 4.4.1.</P>
            <P>9.1.2 All other quality control checks outlined in Methods 1, 2, 4 and 5 also apply to Method 5I. This includes procedures such as leak-checks, equipment calibration checks, and independent checks of field data sheets for reasonableness and completeness.</P>
            <P>9.2 Quality Control Samples.</P>
            <P>9.2.1 Required QC Sample. A laboratory reagent blank must be collected and analyzed for each lot of acetone used for a field program to confirm that it is of suitable purity. The particulate samples cannot be blank corrected.</P>
            <P>9.2.2 Recommended QC Samples. These samples may be collected and archived for future analyses.</P>

            <P>9.2.2.1 A field reagent blank is a recommended QC sample collected from a portion of the acetone used for cleanup of the probe and nozzle. Take 100 ml of this acetone directly from the wash bottle being used and place it in a glass sample container labeled “field acetone reagent blank.” At least one field reagent blank is recommended for every five runs completed. The field reagent blank samples demonstrate the purity of the acetone was maintained throughout the program.<PRTPAGE P="241"/>
            </P>
            <P>9.2.2.2 A field bias blank train is a recommended QC sample. This sample is collected by recovering a probe and filter assembly that has been assembled, taken to the sample location, leak checked, heated, allowed to sit at the sample location for a similar duration of time as a regular sample run, leak-checked again, and then recovered in the same manner as a regular sample. Field bias blanks are not a Method requirement, however, they are recommended and are very useful for identifying sources of contamination in emission testing samples. Field bias blank train results greater than 5 times the method detection limit may be considered problematic.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10. Calibration and Standardization Same as Method 5, section 5.</HD>
            <P>10.1 Field Balance Calibration Check. Check the calibration of the balance used to weigh impingers with a weight that is at least 500g or within 50g of a loaded impinger. The weight must be ASTM E617-13 “Standard Specification for Laboratory Weights and Precision Mass Standards” (incorporated by reference—see 40 CFR 60.17) Class 6 (or better). Daily, before use, the field balance must measure the weight within ±0.5g of the certified mass. If the daily balance calibration check fails, perform corrective measures and repeat the check before using balance.</P>
            <P>10.2 Analytical Balance Calibration. Perform a multipoint calibration (at least five points spanning the operational range) of the analytical balance before the first use, and semiannually thereafter. The calibration of the analytical balance must be conducted using ASTM E617-13 “Standard Specification for Laboratory Weights and Precision Mass Standards” (incorporated by reference—see 40 CFR 60.17) Class 2 (or better) tolerance weights. Audit the balance each day it is used for gravimetric measurements by weighing at least one ASTM E617-13 Class 2 tolerance (or better) calibration weight that corresponds to 50 to 150 percent of the weight of one filter or between 1g and 5g. If the scale cannot reproduce the value of the calibration weight to within 0.5 mg of the certified mass, perform corrective measures and conduct the multipoint calibration before use.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11. Analytical Procedures.</HD>
            <P>11.1 Analysis. Same as Method 5, sections 11.1-11.2.4, with the following exceptions:</P>
            <P>11.1.1 Container No. 1. Same as Method 5, section 11.2.1, with the following exception: Use disposable gloves to remove each of the filter holder assemblies from the desiccator, transport container, or sample oven (after appropriate cooling).</P>
            <P>11.1.2 Container No. 2. Same as Method 5, section 11.2.2, with the following exception: It is recommended that the contents of Container No. 2 be transferred to a 250 ml beaker with a Teflon liner or similar container that has a minimal tare weight before bringing to dryness.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">12. Data Analysis and Calculations.</HD>
            <P>12.1 Particulate Emissions. The analytical results cannot be blank corrected for residual acetone found in any of the blanks. All other sample calculations are identical to Method 5.</P>
            <P>12.2 Paired Trains Outliers. a. Outliers are identified through the determination of precision and any systemic bias of the paired trains. Data that do not meet this criteria should be flagged as a data quality problem. The primary reason for performing dual train sampling is to generate information to quantify the precision of the Reference Method data. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of paired data is the parameter used to quantify data precision. RSD for two simultaneously gathered data points is determined according to:</P>
            <GPH DEEP="17" SPAN="1">
              <GID>ER30SE99.008</GID>
            </GPH>
            <FP>where, Ca and Cb are concentration values determined from trains A and B respectively. For RSD calculation, the concentration units are unimportant so long as they are consistent.</FP>
            <P>b. A minimum precision criteria for Reference Method PM data is that RSD for any data pair must be less than 10% as long as the mean PM concentration is greater than 10 mg/dscm. If the mean PM concentration is less than 10 mg/dscm higher RSD values are acceptable. At mean PM concentration of 1 mg/dscm acceptable RSD for paired trains is 25%. Between 1 and 10 mg/dscm acceptable RSD criteria should be linearly scaled from 25% to 10%. Pairs of manual method data exceeding these RSD criteria should be eliminated from the data set used to develop a PM CEMS correlation or to assess RCA. If the mean PM concentration is less than 1 mg/dscm, RSD does not apply and the mean result is acceptable.</P>

            <P>The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.</P>
            <P>Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.</P>
            <P>Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.</P>
            <P>The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.</P>
            <P>Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.</P>

            <P>Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that <PRTPAGE P="244"/>the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>

            <P>4.1 Free Ammonia. Free ammonia interferes with this method by reacting with SO<E T="52">2</E> to form particulate sulfite and by reacting with the indicator. If free ammonia is present (this can be determined by knowledge of the process and/or noticing white particulate matter in the probe and isopropanol bubbler), alternative methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator are required. One approved alternative is listed in Reference 13 of section 17.0.</P>

            <P>4.2 Water-Soluble Cations and Fluorides. The cations and fluorides are removed by a glass wool filter and an isopropanol bubbler; therefore, they do not affect the SO<E T="52">2</E> analysis. When samples are collected from a gas stream with high concentrations of metallic fumes (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> very fine cation aerosols) a high-efficiency glass fiber filter must be used in place of the glass wool plug (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the one in the probe) to remove the cation interferent.</P>

            <P>6.1 Sample Collection. The following items are required for sample collection:</P>

            <P>6.1.1 Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train is shown in Figure 6-1. The sampling equipment described in Method 8 may be substituted in place of the midget impinger equipment of Method 6. However, the Method 8 train must be modified to include a heated filter between the probe and isopropanol impinger, and the operation of the sampling train and sample analysis must be at the flow rates and solution volumes defined in Method 8. Alternatively, SO<E T="52">2</E> may be determined simultaneously with particulate <PRTPAGE P="245"/>matter and moisture determinations by either (1) replacing the water in a Method 5 impinger system with a 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> solution, or (2) replacing the Method 5 water impinger system with a Method 8 isopropanol-filter-H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> system. The analysis for SO<E T="52">2</E> must be consistent with the procedure of Method 8. The Method 6 sampling train consists of the following components:</P>
            <P>6.1.1.1 Probe. Borosilicate glass or stainless steel (other materials of construction may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator), approximately 6 mm (0.25 in.) inside diameter, with a heating system to prevent water condensation and a filter (either in-stack or heated out-of-stack) to remove particulate matter, including sulfuric acid mist. A plug of glass wool is a satisfactory filter.</P>

            <P>6.1.1.2 Bubbler and Impingers. One midget bubbler with medium-coarse glass frit and borosilicate or quartz glass wool packed in top (see Figure 6-1) to prevent sulfuric acid mist carryover, and three 30-ml midget impingers. The midget bubbler and midget impingers must be connected in series with leak-free glass connectors. Silicone grease may be used, if necessary, to prevent leakage. A midget impinger may be used in place of the midget bubbler.

            <P>8.1 Preparation of Sampling Train. Measure 15 ml of 80 percent isopropanol into the midget bubbler and 15 ml of 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> into each of the first two midget impingers. Leave the final midget impinger dry. Assemble the train as shown in Figure 6-1. Adjust the probe heater to a temperature sufficient to prevent water condensation. Place crushed ice and water around the impingers.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sampling Train Leak-Check Procedure. A leak-check prior to the sampling run is recommended, but not required. A leak-check after the sampling run is mandatory. The leak-check procedure is as follows:</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Temporarily attach a suitable (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 0- to 40- ml/min) rotameter to the outlet of the DGM, and place a vacuum gauge at or near the probe inlet. Plug the probe inlet, pull a vacuum of at least 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg), and note the flow rate as indicated by the rotameter. A leakage rate in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate is not acceptable.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Carefully (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> slowly) release the probe inlet plug before turning off the pump.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.2.2 It is suggested (not mandatory) that the pump be leak-checked separately, either prior to or after the sampling run. To leak-check the pump, proceed as follows: Disconnect the drying tube from the probe-impinger assembly. Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to either the drying tube or the pump, pull a vacuum of 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg), plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum should remain stable for at least 30 seconds.</P>
            <P>If performed prior to the sampling run, the pump leak-check shall precede the leak-check of the sampling train described immediately above; if performed after the sampling run, the pump leak-check shall follow the sampling train leak-check.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Other leak-check procedures may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>8.3 Sample Collection.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Record the initial DGM reading and barometric pressure. To begin sampling, position the tip of the probe at the sampling point, connect the probe to the bubbler, and start the pump. Adjust the sample flow to a constant rate of approximately 1.0 liter/min as indicated by the rate meter. Maintain this constant rate (±10 percent) during the entire sampling run.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Take readings (DGM volume, temperatures at DGM and at impinger outlet, and rate meter flow rate) at least every 5 minutes. Add more ice during the run to keep the temperature of the gases leaving the last impinger at 20 °C (68 °F) or less.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 At the conclusion of each run, turn off the pump, remove the probe from the stack, and record the final readings. Conduct a leak-check as described in section 8.2. (This leak-check is mandatory.) If a leak is detected, void the test run or use procedures acceptable to the Administrator to adjust the sample volume for the leakage.</P>

            <P>8.3.4 Drain the ice bath, and purge the remaining part of the train by drawing clean ambient air through the system for 15 minutes at the sampling rate. Clean ambient air can be provided by passing air through a charcoal filter or through an extra midget impinger containing 15 ml of 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>. Alternatively, ambient air without purification may be used.<PRTPAGE P="247"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.4 Sample Recovery. Disconnect the impingers after purging. Discard the contents of the midget bubbler. Pour the contents of the midget impingers into a leak-free polyethylene bottle for shipment. Rinse the three midget impingers and the connecting tubes with water, and add the rinse to the same storage container. Mark the fluid level. Seal and identify the sample container.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 Calibration and Standardization</HD>
            <P>10.1 Volume Metering System.</P>
            <P>10.1.1 Initial Calibration.</P>
            <P>10.1.1.1 Before its initial use in the field, leak-check the metering system (drying tube, needle valve, pump, rate meter, and DGM) as follows: Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to the drying tube and pull a vacuum of 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg). Plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum must remain stable for at least 30 seconds. Carefully release the vacuum gauge before releasing the flow meter end.</P>

            <P>10.1.1.2 Remove the drying tube, and calibrate the metering system (at the sampling flow rate specified by the method) as follows: Connect an appropriately sized wet-test meter (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 1 liter per revolution) to the inlet of the needle valve. Make three independent calibration runs, using at least five revolutions of the DGM per run. Calculate the calibration factor Y (wet-test meter calibration volume divided by the DGM volume, both volumes adjusted to the same reference temperature and pressure) for each run, and average the results (Y<E T="52">i</E>). If any Y-value deviates by more than 2 percent from (Y<E T="52">i</E>), the metering system is unacceptable for use. If the metering system is acceptable, use (Y<E T="52">i</E>) as the calibration factor for subsequent test runs.</P>

            <P>10.1.2 Post-Test Calibration Check. After each field test series, conduct a calibration check using the procedures outlined in section 10.1.1.2, except that three or more revolutions of the DGM may be used, and only two independent runs need be made. If the average of the two post-test calibration factors does not deviate by more than 5 percent from Y<E T="52">i</E>, then Y<E T="52">i</E> is accepted as the DGM calibration factor (Y), which is used in Equation 6-1 to calculate collected sample volume (see section 12.2). If the deviation is more than 5 percent, recalibrate the metering system as in section 10.1.1, and determine a post-test calibration factor (Y<E T="52">f</E>). Compare Y<E T="52">i</E> and Y<E T="52">f</E>; the smaller of the two factors is accepted as the DGM calibration factor. If recalibration indicates that the metering system is unacceptable for use, either void the test run or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to determine an acceptable value for the collected sample volume.</P>
            <P>10.1.3 DGM as a Calibration Standard. A DGM may be used as a calibration standard for volume measurements in place of the wet-test meter specified in section 10.1.1.2, provided that it is calibrated initially and recalibrated periodically according to the same procedures outlined in Method 5, section 10.3 with the following exceptions: (a) the DGM is calibrated against a wet-test meter having a capacity of 1 liter/rev (0.035 ft<SU>3</SU>/rev) or 3 liters/rev (0.1 ft<SU>3</SU>/rev) and having the capability of measuring volume to within 1 percent; (b) the DGM is calibrated at 1 liter/min (0.035 cfm); and (c) the meter box of the Method 6 sampling train is calibrated at the same flow rate.</P>
            <P>10.2 Temperature Sensors. Calibrate against mercury-in-glass thermometers. An alternative mercury-free thermometer may be used if the thermometer is, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.</P>
            <P>10.3 Rate Meter. The rate meter need not be calibrated, but should be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.</P>
            <P>10.4 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer or NIST-traceable barometer prior to the field test.</P>
            <P>10.5 Barium Standard Solution.

            <P>16.2.1 Preparation of Sampling Train. Assemble the sampling train as shown in Figure 6-2. The rate meter and surge tank are optional but are recommended in order to detect changes in the flow rate.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The critical orifices can be adapted to a Method 6 type sampling train as follows: Insert sleeve type, serum bottle stoppers into two reducing unions. Insert the needle into the stoppers as shown in Figure 6-3.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>16.2.2 Selection of Critical Orifices.</P>

            <P>16.2.2.1 The procedure that follows describes the use of hypodermic needles and stainless steel needle tubings, which have been found suitable for use as critical orifices. Other materials and critical orifice designs may be used provided the orifices act as true critical orifices, (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a critical vacuum can be obtained) as described in this section. Select a critical orifice that is sized to operate at the desired flow rate. The needle sizes and tubing lengths shown in Table 6-1 give the following approximate flow rates.</P>
            <P>16.2.2.2 Determine the suitability and the appropriate operating vacuum of the critical orifice as follows: If applicable, temporarily attach a rate meter and surge tank to the outlet of the sampling train, if said equipment is not present (see section 16.2.1). Turn on the pump and adjust the valve to give an outlet vacuum reading corresponding to about half of the atmospheric pressure. Observe the rate meter reading. Slowly increase the vacuum until a stable reading is obtained on the rate meter. Record the critical vacuum, which is the outlet vacuum when the rate meter first reaches a stable value. Orifices that do not reach a critical value must not be used.</P>
            <P>16.2.3 Field Procedures.</P>

            <P>16.2.3.1 Leak-Check Procedure. A leak-check before the sampling run is recommended, but not required. The leak-check procedure is as follows: Temporarily attach a suitable (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, 0-40 ml/min) rotameter and surge tank, or a soap bubble meter and surge tank to the outlet of the pump. Plug the probe inlet, pull an outlet vacuum of at least 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg), and note the flow rate as indicated by the rotameter or bubble meter. A leakage rate in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate (Q<AC T="8"/>
              <E T="52">std</E>) is not acceptable. Carefully release the probe inlet plug before turning off the pump.</P>
            <P>16.2.3.2 Moisture Determination. At the sampling location, prior to testing, determine the percent moisture of the ambient air using the wet and dry bulb temperatures or, if appropriate, a relative humidity meter.</P>

            <P>16.2.3.3 Critical Orifice Calibration. At the sampling location, prior to testing, calibrate the entire sampling train (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, determine the flow rate of the sampling train when operated at critical conditions). Attach a 500-ml soap bubble meter to the inlet of the probe, and operate the sampling train at an outlet vacuum of 25 to 50 mm Hg (1 to 2 in. Hg) above the critical vacuum. Record the information listed in Figure 6-4. Calculate the standard volume of air measured by the soap bubble meter and the volumetric flow rate using the equations below:</P>

            <P>16.2.3.4 Sampling.</P>
            <P>16.2.3.4.1 Operate the sampling train for sample collection at the same vacuum used during the calibration run. Start the watch and pump simultaneously. Take readings (temperature, rate meter, inlet vacuum, and outlet vacuum) at least every 5 minutes. At the end of the sampling run, stop the watch and pump simultaneously.</P>

            <P>16.2.3.4.2 Conduct a post-test calibration run using the calibration procedure outlined in section 16.2.3.3. If the Q<E T="52">std</E> obtained before and after the test differ by more than 5 percent, void the test run; if not, calculate the volume of the gas measured with the critical orifice using Equation 6-6 as follows:</P>

            <P>16.2.3.4.4 Drain the ice bath, and purge the sampling train using the procedure described in section 8.3.4.</P>
            <P>16.3 Elimination of Ammonia Interference. The following alternative procedures must be used in addition to those specified in the method when sampling at sources having ammonia emissions.</P>

            <P>16.3.1 Sampling. The probe shall be maintained at 275 °C (527 °F) and equipped with a high-efficiency in-stack filter (glass fiber) to remove particulate matter. The filter material shall be unreactive to SO<E T="52">2</E>. Whatman 934AH (formerly Reeve Angel 934AH) filters treated as described in Reference 10 in section 17.0 of Method 5 is an example of a filter that has been shown to work. Where alkaline particulate matter and condensed moisture are present in the gas stream, the filter shall be heated above the moisture dew point but below 225 °C (437 °F).</P>
            <P>16.3.2 Sample Recovery. Recover the sample according to section 8.4 except for discarding the contents of the midget bubbler. Add the bubbler contents, including the rinsings of the bubbler with water, to a separate polyethylene bottle from the rest of the sample. Under normal testing conditions where sulfur trioxide will not be present significantly, the tester may opt to delete the midget bubbler from the sampling train. If an approximation of the sulfur trioxide concentration is desired, transfer the contents of the midget bubbler to a separate polyethylene bottle.</P>

            <P>16.3.3 Sample Analysis. Follow the procedures in sections 11.1 and 11.2, except add 0.5 ml of 0.1 N HCl to the Erlenmeyer flask and mix before adding the indicator. The following analysis procedure may be used for an approximation of the sulfur trioxide concentration. The accuracy of the calculated concentration will depend upon the ammonia to SO<E T="52">2</E> ratio and the level of oxygen present in the gas stream. A fraction of the SO<E T="52">2</E> will be counted as sulfur trioxide as the ammonia to SO<E T="52">2</E> ratio and the sample oxygen content increases. Generally, when this ratio is 1 or less and the oxygen content is in the range of 5 percent, less than 10 percent of the SO<E T="52">2</E> will be counted as sulfur trioxide. Analyze the peroxide and isopropanol sample portions separately. Analyze the peroxide portion as described above. Sulfur trioxide is determined by difference using sequential titration of the isopropanol portion of the sample. Transfer the contents of the isopropanol storage container to a 100-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to exactly 100 ml with water. Pipette a 20-ml aliquot of this solution into a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 0.5 ml of 0.1 N HCl, 80 ml of 100 percent isopropanol, and two to four drops of thorin indicator. Titrate to a pink endpoint using 0.0100 N barium perchlorate. Repeat and average the titration volumes that agree within 1 percent or 0.2 ml, whichever is larger. Use this volume in Equation 6-2 to determine the sulfur trioxide concentration. From the flask containing the remainder of the isopropanol sample, determine the fraction of SO<E T="52">2</E> collected in the bubbler by pipetting 20-ml aliquots into 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Add 5 ml of 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>, 100 ml of 100 percent isopropanol, and two to four drips of thorin indicator, and titrate as before. From this titration volume, subtract the titrant volume determined for sulfur trioxide, and add the titrant volume determined for the peroxide portion. This final volume constitutes V<E T="52">t</E>, the volume of barium perchlorate used for the SO<E T="52">2</E> sample.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>) emissions from fossil fuel combustion sources in terms of concentration (mg/dscm or lb/dscf) and in terms of emission rate (ng/J or lb/10<SU>6</SU> Btu) and for the determination of carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) concentration (percent). Moisture content (percent), if desired, may also be determined by this method.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>

            <P>8.1 Preparation of Sampling Train.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 Measure 15 ml of 80 percent isopropanol into the first midget bubbler and 15 ml of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide into each of the two midget impingers (the second <PRTPAGE P="257"/>and third vessels in the train) as described in Method 6, section 8.1. Insert the glass wool into the top of the isopropanol bubbler as shown in Figure 6A-1. Place about 25 g of Drierite into the second midget bubbler (the fourth vessel in the train). Clean the outside of the bubblers and impingers and allow the vessels to reach room temperature. Weigh the four vessels simultaneously to the nearest 0.1 g, and record this initial weight (m<E T="52">wi</E>).</P>
            <P>8.1.2 With one end of the CO<E T="52">2</E> absorber sealed, place glass wool into the cylinder to a depth of about 1 cm (0.5 in.). Place about 150 g of CO<E T="52">2</E> absorbing material in the cylinder on top of the glass wool, and fill the remaining space in the cylinder with glass wool. Assemble the cylinder as shown in figure 6A-2. With the cylinder in a horizontal position, rotate it around the horizontal axis. The CO<E T="52">2</E> absorbing material should remain in position during the rotation, and no open spaces or channels should be formed. If necessary, pack more glass wool into the cylinder to make the CO<E T="52">2</E> absorbing material stable. Clean the outside of the cylinder of loose dirt and moisture and allow the cylinder to reach room temperature. Weigh the cylinder to the nearest 0.1 g, and record this initial weight (m<E T="52">ai</E>).</P>

            <P>8.1.3 Assemble the train as shown in figure 6A-1. Adjust the probe heater to a temperature sufficient to prevent condensation (see note in section 6.1). Place crushed ice and water around the impingers and bubblers. Mount the CO<E T="52">2</E> absorber outside the water bath in a vertical flow position with the sample gas inlet at the bottom. Flexible tubing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Tygon) may be used to connect the last SO<E T="52">2</E> absorbing impinger to the moisture absorber and to connect the moisture absorber to the CO<E T="52">2</E> absorber. A second, smaller CO<E T="52">2</E> absorber containing Ascarite II may be added in-line downstream of the primary CO<E T="52">2</E> absorber as a breakthrough indicator. Ascarite II turns white when CO<E T="52">2</E> is absorbed.</P>

            <P>8.3.1 Moisture Measurement. Disconnect the isopropanol bubbler, the SO<E T="52">2</E> impingers, and the moisture absorber from the sample train. Allow about 10 minutes for them to reach room temperature, clean the outside of loose dirt and moisture, and weigh them simultaneously in the same manner as in section 8.1. Record this final weight (m<E T="52">wf</E>).</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Peroxide Solution. Discard the contents of the isopropanol bubbler and pour the contents of the midget impingers into a leak-free polyethylene bottle for shipping. Rinse the two midget impingers and connecting tubes with water, and add the washing to the same storage container.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 CO<E T="52">2</E> Absorber. Allow the CO<E T="52">2</E> absorber to warm to room temperature (about 10 minutes), clean the outside of loose dirt and moisture, and weigh to the nearest 0.1 g in the same manner as in section 8.1. Record this final weight (m<E T="52">af</E>). Discard used Ascarite II material.</P>

            <P>8.3.1 The probe and filter (either in-stack, out-of-stack, or both) must be heated to a temperature sufficient to prevent water condensation.</P>

            <P>8.3.2 Record the initial dry gas meter reading. To begin sampling, position the tip of the probe at the sampling point, connect the probe to the first impinger (or filter), and start the timer and the sample pump. Adjust the sample flow to a constant rate of approximately 1.0 liter/min (0.035 cfm) as indicated by the rotameter. Observe the operation of the timer, and determine that it is operating as intended (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the timer is in the “on” position for the desired period, and the cycle repeats as required).</P>

            <P>8.3.3 One time between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. during the 24-hour sampling period, record the dry gas meter temperature (T<E T="52">m</E>) and the barometric pressure (P<E T="52">(bar)</E>).</P>
            <P>8.3.4 At the conclusion of the run, turn off the timer and the sample pump, remove the probe from the stack, and record the final gas meter volume reading. Conduct a leak-check as described in section 8.2. If a leak is found, void the test run or use procedures acceptable to the Administrator to adjust the sample volume for leakage. Repeat the steps in sections 8.3.1 to 8.3.4 for successive runs.</P>

When testing under conditions of low concentrations (&lt;15 ppm), this alternative interference check is not allowed.</P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The procedure described below applies to non-dilution sampling systems only. If this alternative interference check is used for a dilution sampling system, use a standard Method 6 sampling train and extract the sample directly from the exhaust stream at points collocated with the Method 6C sample probe.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <P>a. Build the modified Method 6 sampling train (flow control valve, two midget impingers containing 3 percent hydrogen peroxide, and dry gas meter) shown in Figure 6C-1. Connect the sampling train to the sample bypass discharge vent. Record the dry gas meter reading before you begin sampling. Simultaneously collect modified Method 6 and Method 6C samples. Open the flow control valve in the modified Method 6 train as you begin to sample with Method 6C. Adjust the Method 6 sampling rate to 1 liter per minute (.10 percent). The sampling time per run must be the same as for Method 6 plus twice the average measurement system response time. If your modified Method 6 train does not include a pump, you risk biasing the results high if you over-pressurize the midget impingers and cause a leak. You can reduce this risk by cautiously increasing the flow rate as sampling begins.</P>
            <P>b. After completing a run, record the final dry gas meter reading, meter temperature, and barometric pressure. Recover and analyze the contents of the midget impingers using the procedures in Method 6. Determine the average gas concentration reported by Method 6C for the run.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 Flask Volume. The volume of the collection flask and flask valve combination must be known prior to sampling. Assemble the flask and flask valve, and fill with water to the stopcock. Measure the volume of water to ±10 ml. Record this volume on the flask.</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Pipette 25 ml of absorbing solution into a sample flask, retaining a sufficient quantity for use in preparing the calibration standards. Insert the flask valve stopper into the flask with the valve in the “purge” position. Assemble the sampling train as shown in Figure 7-1, and place the probe at the sampling point. Make sure that all fittings are tight and leak-free, and that all ground glass joints have been greased properly with a high-vacuum, high temperature chlorofluorocarbon-based stopcock grease. Turn the flask valve and the pump valve to their “evacuate” positions. Evacuate the flask to 75 mm (3 in.) Hg absolute pressure, or less. Evacuation to a pressure approaching the vapor pressure of water at the existing temperature is desirable. Turn the pump valve to its “vent” position, and turn off the pump. Check for leakage by observing the manometer for any pressure fluctuation. (Any variation greater than 10 mm (0.4 in.) Hg over a period of 1 minute is not acceptable, and the flask is not to be used until the leakage problem is corrected. Pressure in the flask is not to exceed 75 mm (3 in.) Hg absolute at the time sampling is commenced.) Record the volume of the flask and valve (V<E T="52">f</E>), the flask temperature (T<E T="52">i</E>), and the barometric pressure. Turn the flask valve counterclockwise to its “purge” position, and do the same with the pump valve. Purge the probe and the vacuum tube using the squeeze bulb. If condensation occurs in the probe and the flask valve area, heat the probe, and purge until the condensation disappears. Next, turn the pump valve to its “vent” position. Turn the flask valve clockwise to its “evacuate” position, and record the difference in the mercury levels in the manometer. The absolute internal pressure in the flask (P<E T="52">i</E>) is equal to the barometric pressure less the manometer reading. Immediately turn the flask valve to the “sample” position, and permit the gas to enter the flask until pressures in the flask and sample line (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> duct, stack) are equal. This will usually require about 15 seconds; a longer period indicates a plug in the probe, which must be <PRTPAGE P="269"/>corrected before sampling is continued. After collecting the sample, turn the flask valve to its “purge” position, and disconnect the flask from the sampling train.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Shake the flask for at least 5 minutes.</P>

            <P>8.1.4 If the gas being sampled contains insufficient oxygen for the conversion of NO to NO<E T="52">2</E> (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an applicable subpart of the standards may require taking a sample of a calibration gas mixture of NO in N<E T="52">2</E>), then introduce oxygen into the flask to permit this conversion. Oxygen may be introduced into the flask by one of three methods: (1) Before evacuating the sampling flask, flush with pure cylinder oxygen, then evacuate flask to 75 mm (3 in.) Hg absolute pressure or less; or (2) inject oxygen into the flask after sampling; or (3) terminate sampling with a minimum of 50 mm (2 in.) Hg vacuum remaining in the flask, record this final pressure, and then vent the flask to the atmosphere until the flask pressure is almost equal to atmospheric pressure.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sample Recovery. Let the flask sit for a minimum of 16 hours, and then shake the contents for 2 minutes.</P>

            <P>8.2.1 Connect the flask to a mercury filled U-tube manometer. Open the valve from the flask to the manometer, and record the flask temperature (T<E T="52">f</E>), the barometric pressure, and the difference between the mercury levels in the manometer. The absolute internal pressure in the flask (P<E T="52">f</E>) is the barometric pressure less the manometer reading. Transfer the contents of the flask to a leak-free polyethylene bottle. Rinse the flask twice with 5 ml portions of water, and add the rinse water to the bottle. Adjust the pH to between 9 and 12 by adding 1 N NaOH, dropwise (about 25 to 35 drops). Check the pH by dipping a stirring rod into the solution and then touching the rod to the pH test paper. Remove as little material as possible during this step. Mark the height of the liquid level so that the container can be checked for leakage after transport. Label the container to identify clearly its contents. Seal the container for shipping.</P>

            <P>10.1.1 Optimum Wavelength Determination.</P>
            <P>10.1.1.1 Calibrate the wavelength scale of the spectrophotometer every 6 months. The calibration may be accomplished by using an energy source with an intense line emission such as a mercury lamp, or by using a series of glass filters spanning the measuring range of the spectrophotometer. Calibration materials are available commercially and from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Specific details on the use of such materials should be supplied by the vendor; general information about calibration techniques can be obtained from general reference books on analytical chemistry. The wavelength scale of the spectrophotometer must read correctly within 5 nm at all calibration points; otherwise, repair and recalibrate the spectrophotometer. Once the wavelength scale of the spectrophotometer is in proper calibration, use 410 nm as the optimum wavelength for the measurement of the absorbance of the standards and samples.</P>

            <P>10.1.1.2 Alternatively, a scanning procedure may be employed to determine the proper measuring wavelength. If the instrument is a double-beam spectrophotometer, scan the spectrum between 400 and 415 nm using a 200 µg NO<E T="52">2</E> standard solution in the sample cell and a blank solution in the reference cell. If a peak does not occur, the spectrophotometer is probably malfunctioning and should be repaired. When a peak is obtained within the 400 to 415 nm range, the wavelength at which this peak occurs shall be the optimum wavelength for the measurement of absorbance of both the standards and the samples. For a single-beam spectrophotometer, follow the scanning procedure described above, except scan separately the blank and standard solutions. The optimum wavelength shall be the wavelength at which the maximum difference in absorbance between the standard and the blank occurs.</P>

            <P>10.1.2 Determination of Spectrophotometer Calibration Factor K<E T="52">c</E>. Add 0 ml, 2.0 ml, 4.0 ml, 6.0 ml, and 8.0 ml of the KNO<E T="52">3</E> working standard solution (1 ml = 100 µg NO<E T="52">2</E>) to a series of five 50-ml volumetric flasks. To each flask, add 25 ml of absorbing solution and 10 ml water. Add 1 N NaOH to each flask until the pH is between 9 and 12 (about 25 to 35 drops). Dilute to the mark with water. Mix thoroughly, and pipette a 25-ml aliquot of each solution into a separate porcelain evaporating dish. Beginning with the evaporation step, follow the analysis procedure of section 11.2 until the solution has been transferred to the 100-ml volumetric flask and diluted to the mark. Measure the absorbance of each solution at the optimum wavelength as determined in section 10.1.1. This calibration procedure must be repeated on each day that samples are analyzed. Calculate the spectrophotometer calibration factor as shown in section 12.2.<PRTPAGE P="270"/>

            <P>10.1.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control.

The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 100, 200, 300, and 400 µg NO<E T="52">2</E>) should be less than 7 percent for all standards.</P>

            <P>11.1 Sample Loss Check. Note the level of the liquid in the container, and confirm whether any sample was lost during shipment. Note this on the analytical data sheet. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results.</P>
            <P>11.2 Sample Preparation. Immediately prior to analysis, transfer the contents of the shipping container to a 50 ml volumetric flask, and rinse the container twice with 5 ml portions of water. Add the rinse water to the flask, and dilute to mark with water; mix thoroughly. Pipette a 25-ml aliquot into the porcelain evaporating dish. Return any unused portion of the sample to the polyethylene storage bottle. Evaporate the 25-ml aliquot to dryness on a steam bath, and allow to cool. Add 2 ml phenoldisulfonic acid solution to the dried residue, and triturate thoroughly with a polyethylene policeman. Make sure the solution contacts all the residue. Add 1 ml water and 4 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. Heat the solution on a steam bath for 3 minutes with occasional stirring. Allow the solution to cool, add 20 ml water, mix well by stirring, and add concentrated ammonium hydroxide, dropwise, with constant stirring, until the pH is 10 (as determined by pH paper). If the sample contains solids, these must be removed by filtration (centrifugation is an acceptable alternative, subject to the approval of the Administrator) as follows: Filter through Whatman No. 41 filter paper into a 100-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the evaporating dish with three 5-ml portions of water. Filter these three rinses. Wash the filter with at least three 15-ml portions of water. Add the filter washings to the contents of the volumetric flask, and dilute to the mark with water. If solids are absent, the solution can be transferred directly to the 100-ml volumetric flask and diluted to the mark with water.</P>

            <P>11.3 Sample Analysis. Mix the contents of the flask thoroughly, and measure the absorbance at the optimum wavelength used for the standards (section 10.1.1), using the blank solution as a zero reference. Dilute the sample and the blank with equal volumes of water if the absorbance exceeds A<E T="52">4</E>, the absorbance of the 400-µg NO<E T="52">2</E> standard (see section 10.1.3).</P>

At or above 2100 ppm SO<E T="52">2</E>, use five times the H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> concentration of the Method 7 absorbing solution. Laboratory tests have shown that high concentrations of SO<E T="52">2</E> (about 2100 ppm) cause low results in Method 7 and 7A. Increasing the H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> concentration to five times the original concentration eliminates this bias. However, when no SO<E T="52">2</E> is present, increasing the concentration by five times results in a low bias.</P>

            <P>10.1.1 Determination of Ion Chromatograph Calibration Factor S. Prepare a series of five standards by adding 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 10.0 ml of working standard solution (25 µg/ml) to a series of five 50-ml volumetric flasks. (The standard masses will equal 25, 50, 100, 150, and 250 µg.) Dilute each flask to the mark with water, and mix well. Analyze with the samples as described in section 11.2, and subtract the blank from each value. Prepare or calculate a linear regression plot of the standard masses in µg (x-axis) versus their peak height responses in millimeters (y-axis). (Take peak height measurements with symmetrical peaks; in all other cases, calculate peak areas.) From this curve, or equation, determine the slope, and calculate its reciprocal to denote as the calibration factor, S.</P>

If any point on the calibration curve deviates from the line by more than 7 percent of the concentration at that point, remake and reanalyze that standard. This deviation can be determined by multiplying S times the peak height response for each standard. The resultant concentrations must not differ by more than 7 percent from each known standard mass (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 25, 50, 100, 150, and 250 µg).</P>

            <P>An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack and passed through impingers containing an alkaline potassium permanganate solution; NO<E T="52">X</E> (NO + NO<E T="52">2</E>) emissions are oxidized to NO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">3</E>. Then NO<E T="52">3</E>
              <E T="51">−</E>is reduced to NO<E T="52">2</E>
              <E T="51">−</E>with cadmium, and the NO<E T="52">2</E>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>
            <P>Possible interferents are sulfur dioxides (SO<E T="52">2</E>) and ammonia (NH<E T="52">3</E>).</P>
            <P>4.1 High concentrations of SO<E T="52">2</E> could interfere because SO<E T="52">2</E> consumes MnO<E T="52">4</E> (as does NO<E T="52">X</E>) and, therefore, could reduce the NO<E T="52">X</E> collection efficiency. However, when sampling emissions from a coal-fired electric utility plant burning 2.1 percent sulfur coal with no control of SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions, collection efficiency was not reduced. In fact, calculations show that sampling 3000 ppm SO<E T="52">2</E> will reduce the MnO<E T="52">4</E> concentration by only 5 percent if all the SO<E T="52">2</E> is consumed in the first impinger.</P>
            <P>4.2 Ammonia (NH<E T="52">3</E>) is slowly oxidized to NO<E T="52">3</E>
              <E T="51">−</E> by the absorbing solution. At 100 ppm NH<E T="52">3</E> in the gas stream, an interference of 6 ppm NO<E T="52">X</E> (11 mg NO<E T="52">2</E>/m<SU>3</SU>) was observed when the sample was analyzed 10 days after collection. Therefore, the method may not be applicable to plants using NH<E T="52">3</E> injection to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions unless means are taken to correct the results. An equation has been developed to allow quantification of the interference and is discussed in Reference 5 of section 16.0.</P>

Determine the sampling point or points according to the appropriate regulations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> § 60.46(b)(5) of 40 CFR Part 60). Position the tip of the probe at the sampling point, connect the probe to the first impinger, and start the pump. Adjust the sample flow to a value between 400 and 500 ml/min (0.014 and 0.018 cfm). CAUTION: DO NOT EXCEED THESE FLOW RATES. Once adjusted, maintain a constant flow rate during the entire sampling run. Sample for 60 minutes. For relative accuracy (RA) testing of continuous emission monitors, the minimum sampling time is 1 hour, sampling 20 minutes at each traverse point.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>When the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration is greater than 1200 ppm, the sampling time may have to be reduced to 30 minutes to eliminate plugging of the impinger orifice with MnO<E T="52">2</E>. For RA tests with SO<E T="52">2</E> greater than 1200 ppm, sample for 30 minutes (10 minutes at each point).</P>

            <P>8.3.2 Record the DGM temperature, and check the flow rate at least every 5 minutes. At the conclusion of each run, turn off the pump, remove the probe from the stack, and record the final readings. Divide the sample volume by the sampling time to determine the average flow rate. Conduct the mandatory post-test leak-check. If a leak is found, void the test run, or use procedures acceptable to the Administrator to adjust the sample volume for the leakage.</P>
            <P>8.4 CO<E T="52">2</E> Measurement. During sampling, measure the CO<E T="52">2</E> content of the stack gas near the sampling point using Method 3. The single-point grab sampling procedure is adequate, provided the measurements are made at least three times (near the start, midway, and before the end of a run), and the average CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration is computed. The Orsat or Fyrite analyzer may be used for this analysis.</P>

            <P>8.5 Sample Recovery. Disconnect the impingers. Pour the contents of the impingers into a 1-liter polyethylene bottle <PRTPAGE P="281"/>using a funnel and a stirring rod (or other means) to prevent spillage. Complete the quantitative transfer by rinsing the impingers and connecting tubes with water until the rinsings are clear to light pink, and add the rinsings to the bottle. Mix the sample, and mark the solution level. Seal and identify the sample container.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The column should not contain any bands of cadmium fines. This may occur if regenerated cadmium is used and will greatly reduce the column lifetime.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>11.2.2 Note the level of liquid in the sample container, and determine whether any sample was lost during shipment. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, the volume lost can be determined from the difference between initial and final solution levels, and this value can then be used to correct the analytical result. Quantitatively transfer the contents to a 1-liter volumetric flask, and dilute to volume.</P>

            <P>11.2.3 Take a 100-ml aliquot of the sample and blank (unexposed KMnO<E T="52">4</E>/NaOH) solutions, and transfer to 400-ml beakers containing magnetic stirring bars. Using a pH meter, add concentrated H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> with stirring until a pH of 0.7 is obtained. Allow the solutions to stand for 15 minutes. Cover the beakers with watch glasses, and bring the temperature of the solutions to 50 °C (122 °F). Keep the temperature below 60 °C (140 °F). Dissolve 4.8 g of oxalic acid in a minimum volume of water, approximately 50 ml, at room temperature. Do not heat the solution. Add this solution slowly, in increments, until the KMnO<E T="52">4</E> solution becomes colorless. If the color is not completely removed, prepare some more of the above oxalic acid solution, and add until a colorless solution is obtained. Add an excess of oxalic acid by dissolving 1.6 g of oxalic acid in 50 ml of water, and add 6 ml of this solution to the colorless solution. If suspended matter is present, add concentrated H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> until a clear solution is obtained.</P>

            <P>11.2.4 Allow the samples to cool to near room temperature, being sure that the samples are still clear. Adjust the pH to between 11.7 and 12.0 with 10 N NaOH. Quantitatively transfer the mixture to a Buchner funnel containing GF/C filter paper, and filter the <PRTPAGE P="282"/>precipitate. Filter the mixture into a 500-ml filtering flask. Wash the solid material four times with water. When filtration is complete, wash the Teflon tubing, quantitatively transfer the filtrate to a 500-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume. The samples are now ready for cadmium reduction. Pipette a 50-ml aliquot of the sample into a 150-ml beaker, and add a magnetic stirring bar. Pipette in 1.0 ml of 6.5 percent EDTA solution, and mix.</P>

            <P>11.3 Determine the correct stopcock setting to establish a flow rate of 7 to 9 ml/min of column rinse solution through the cadmium reduction column. Use a 50-ml graduated cylinder to collect and measure the solution volume. After the last of the rinse solution has passed from the funnel into the burette, but before air entrapment can occur, start adding the sample, and collect it in a 250-ml graduated cylinder. Complete the quantitative transfer of the sample to the column as the sample passes through the column. After the last of the sample has passed from the funnel into the burette, start adding 60 ml of column rinse solution, and collect the rinse solution until the solution just disappears from the funnel. Quantitatively transfer the sample to a 200-ml volumetric flask (a 250-ml flask may be required), and dilute to volume. The samples are now ready for NO<E T="52">2</E>-analysis.

              <P>Two spiked samples should be run with every group of samples passed through the column.

            <P>8.3.1 Note the level of liquid in the sample container, and determine whether any sample was lost during shipment. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, the volume lost can be determined from the difference between initial and final solution levels, and this value can then be used to correct the analytical result.

            <P>8.3.2 Sample preparation can be started 36 hours after collection. This time is necessary to ensure that all NO<E T="52">2</E>

              <E T="51">−</E> in the collection solution. Take a 50-ml aliquot of the sample and blank, and transfer to 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Add a magnetic stirring bar. Adjust the stirring rate to as fast a rate as possible without loss of solution. Add 5 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> in increments of approximately 5 ml using a 5-ml pipette. When the KMnO<E T="52">4</E> color appears to have been removed, allow the precipitate to settle, and examine the supernatant liquid. If the liquid is clear, the H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> addition is complete. If the KMnO<E T="52">4</E> color persists, add more H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>, with stirring, until the supernatant liquid is clear.

Quantitatively transfer the mixture to a Buchner funnel containing GF/C filter paper, and filter the precipitate. The spout of the Buchner funnel should be equipped with a 13-mm ID by 90-mm long piece of Teflon tubing. This modification minimizes the possibility of aspirating sample solution during filtration. Filter the mixture into a 500-ml filtering flask. Wash the solid material four times with water. When filtration is complete, wash the Teflon tubing, quantitatively transfer the filtrate to a 250-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume. The sample and blank are now ready for NO<E T="52">3</E>

How good must my collected data be?</E> Method 7E is designed to provide high-quality data for determining compliance with Federal and State emission standards and for relative accuracy testing of CEMS. In these and other applications, the principal objective is to ensure the accuracy of the data at the actual emission levels encountered. To meet this objective, the use of EPA traceability protocol calibration gases and measurement system performance tests are required.</P>

We encourage you to establish safety procedures before using the method. Among other precautions, you should become familiar with the safety recommendations in the gas analyzer user's manual. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations concerning cylinder and noxious gases may apply. Nitric oxide and NO<E T="52">2</E> are toxic and dangerous gases. Nitric oxide is immediately converted to NO<E T="52">2</E> upon reaction with air. Nitrogen dioxide is a highly poisonous and insidious gas. Inflammation of the lungs from exposure may cause only slight pain or pass unnoticed, but the resulting edema several days later may cause death. A concentration of 100 ppm is dangerous for even a short exposure, and 200 ppm may be fatal. Calibration gases must be handled with utmost care and with adequate ventilation. Emission-level exposure to these gases should be avoided.</P>

            <P>6.1 What do I need for the measurement system? You may use any equipment and supplies meeting the following specifications:</P>
            <P>(1) Sampling system components that are not evaluated in the system bias or system calibration error test must be glass, Teflon, or stainless steel. Other materials are potentially acceptable, subject to approval by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(2) The interference, calibration error, and system bias criteria must be met.</P>
            <P>(3) Sample flow rate must be maintained within 10 percent of the flow rate at which the system response time was measured.</P>

            <P>(4) All system components (excluding sample conditioning components, if used) must maintain the sample temperature above the moisture dew point. Ensure minimal contact between any condensate and the sample gas. Section 6.2 provides example equipment specifications for a NO<E T="52">X</E> measurement system. Figure 7E-1 is a diagram of an example dry-basis measurement system that is likely to meet the method requirements and is provided as guidance. For wet-basis systems, you may use alternative equipment and supplies as needed (some of which are described in Section 6.2), provided that the measurement system meets the applicable performance specifications of this method.</P>

              <E T="03">6.2 Measurement System Components</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.1 Sample Probe.</E> Glass, stainless steel, or other approved material, of sufficient length to traverse the sample points.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.2 Particulate Filter.</E> An in-stack or out-of-stack filter. The filter must be made of material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled. The filter media for out-of-stack filters must be included in the system bias test. The particulate filter requirement may be waived in applications where no significant particulate matter is expected (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, for emission testing of a combustion turbine firing natural gas).<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.3 Sample Line.</E> The sample line from the probe to the conditioning system/sample pump should be made of Teflon or other material that does not absorb or otherwise alter the sample gas. For a dry-basis measurement system (as shown in Figure 7E-1), the temperature of the sample line must be maintained at a sufficiently high level to prevent condensation before the sample conditioning components. For wet-basis measurement systems, the temperature of the sample line must be maintained at a sufficiently high level to prevent condensation before the analyzer.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.4 Conditioning Equipment.</E> For dry basis measurements, a condenser, dryer or other suitable device is required to remove moisture continuously from the sample gas. Any equipment needed to heat the probe or sample line to avoid condensation prior to the sample conditioning component is also required.</P>
            <P>For wet basis systems, you must keep the sample above its dew point either by: (1) Heating the sample line and all sample transport components up to the inlet of the analyzer (and, for hot-wet extractive systems, also heating the analyzer) or (2) by diluting the sample prior to analysis using a dilution probe system. The components required to do either of the above are considered to be conditioning equipment.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.5 Sampling Pump.</E> For systems similar to the one shown in Figure 7E-1, a leak-free pump is needed to pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system. The pump may be constructed of any material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled. For dilution-type measurement systems, an ejector pump (eductor) is used to create a vacuum that draws the sample through a critical orifice at a constant rate.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.6 Calibration Gas Manifold.</E> Prepare a system to allow the introduction of calibration gases either directly to the gas analyzer in direct calibration mode or into the measurement system, at the probe, in system calibration mode, or both, depending upon the type of system used. In system calibration mode, the system should be able to flood the sampling probe and vent excess gas. Alternatively, calibration gases may be introduced at the calibration valve following the probe. Maintain a constant pressure in the gas manifold. For in-stack dilution-type systems, a gas dilution subsystem is required to transport large volumes of purified air to the sample probe and a probe controller is needed to maintain the proper dilution ratio.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.7 Sample Gas Manifold.</E> For the type of system shown in Figure 7E-1, the sample gas manifold diverts a portion of the sample to the analyzer, delivering the remainder to the by-pass discharge vent. The manifold should also be able to introduce calibration gases directly to the analyzer (except for dilution-type systems). The manifold must be made of material that is non-reactive to the gas sampled or the calibration gas and be configured to safely discharge the bypass gas.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.8 NO</E>
              <E T="54">X</E>
              <E T="03">Analyzer.</E> An instrument that continuously measures NO<E T="52">X</E> in the gas stream and meets the applicable specifications in section 13.0. An analyzer that operates on the principle of chemiluminescence with an NO<E T="52">2</E> to NO converter is one example of an analyzer that has been used successfully in the past. Analyzers operating on other principles may also be used provided the performance criteria in section 13.0 are met.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.8.1 Dual Range Analyzers.</E> For certain applications, a wide range of gas concentrations may be encountered, necessitating the use of two measurement ranges. Dual-range analyzers are readily available for these applications. These analyzers are often equipped with automated range-switching capability, so that when readings exceed the full-scale of the low measurement range, they are recorded on the high range. As an alternative to using a dual-range analyzer, you may use two segments of a single, large measurement scale to serve as the low and high ranges. In all cases, when two ranges are used, you must quality-assure both ranges using the proper sets of calibration gases. You must also meet the interference, calibration error, system bias, and drift checks. However, we caution that when you use two segments of a large measurement scale for dual range purposes, it may be difficult to meet the performance specifications on the low range due to signal-to-noise ratio considerations.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.8.2 Low Concentration Analyzer.</E> When an analyzer is routinely calibrated with a calibration span of 20 ppmv or less, the manufacturer's stability test (MST) is required. See Table 7E-5 for test parameters.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">6.2.9 Data Recording.</E> A strip chart recorder, computerized data acquisition system, digital recorder, or data logger for recording measurement data may be used.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">7.1 Calibration Gas.</E> What calibration gases do I need? Your calibration gas must be NO in N<E T="52">2</E> and certified (or recertified) within an uncertainty of 2.0 percent in accordance with “EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards” September 1997, as amended August 25, 1999, EPA-600/R-97/121. Blended gases meeting the Traceability Protocol are allowed if the additional gas components are shown not to interfere with the analysis. If a zero gas is used for the low-level gas, it must meet the requirements under the definition for “zero air material” in 40 CFR 72.2. The calibration gas must not be used after its expiration date. Except for applications under part 75 of <PRTPAGE P="293"/>this chapter, it is acceptable to prepare calibration gas mixtures from EPA Traceability Protocol gases in accordance with Method 205 in appendix M to part 51 of this chapter. For part 75 applications, the use of Method 205 is subject to the approval of the Administrator. The goal and recommendation for selecting calibration gases is to bracket the sample concentrations. The following calibration gas concentrations are required:</P>
            <P>7.1.1 <E T="03">High-Level Gas.</E> This concentration is chosen to set the calibration span as defined in Section 3.4.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">7.1.2 Mid-Level Gas.</E> 40 to 60 percent of the calibration span.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">7.1.3 Low-Level Gas.</E> Less than 20 percent of the calibration span.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">7.1.4 Converter Efficiency Gas. What reagents do I need for the converter efficiency test?</E> The converter efficiency gas is a manufacturer-certified gas with a concentration sufficient to show NO<E T="52">2</E> conversion at the concentrations encountered in the source. A test gas concentration in the 40 to 60 ppm range is suggested, but other concentrations may be more appropriate to specific sources. For the test described in section 8.2.4.1, NO<E T="52">2</E> is required. For the alternative converter efficiency tests in section 16.2, NO is required.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">7.2 Interference Check. What reagents do I need for the interference check?</E> Use the appropriate test gases listed in Table 7E-3 or others not listed that can potentially interfere (as indicated by the test facility type, instrument manufacturer, etc.) to conduct the interference check. These gases should be manufacturer certified but do not have to be prepared by the EPA traceability protocol.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Emission Test Procedure</HD>
            <P>Since you are allowed to choose different options to comply with some of the performance criteria, it is your responsibility to identify the specific options you have chosen, to document that the performance criteria for that option have been met, and to identify any deviations from the method.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.1 What sampling site and sampling points do I select?</E>
            </P>
            <P>8.1.1 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation or by the Administrator, when this method is used to determine compliance with an emission standard, conduct a stratification test as described in section 8.1.2 to determine the sampling traverse points to be used. For performance testing of continuous emission monitoring systems, follow the sampling site selection and traverse point layout procedures described in the appropriate performance specification or applicable regulation (e.g., Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part).</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Determination of Stratification. Perform a stratification test at each test site to determine the appropriate number of sample traverse points. If testing for multiple pollutants or diluents at the same site, a stratification test using only one pollutant or diluent satisfies this requirement. A stratification test is not required for small stacks that are less than 4 inches in diameter. To test for stratification, use a probe of appropriate length to measure the NO<E T="52">X</E> (or pollutant of interest) concentration at 12 traverse points located according to Table 1-1 or Table 1-2 of Method 1. Alternatively, you may measure at three points on a line passing through the centroidal area. Space the three points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line. Sample for a minimum of twice the system response time (see section 8.2.6) at each traverse point. Calculate the individual point and mean NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations. If the concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by no more than: ±5.0 percent of the mean concentration; or ±0.5 ppm (whichever is less restrictive), the gas stream is considered unstratified, and you may collect samples from a single point that most closely matches the mean. If the 5.0 percent or 0.5 ppm criterion is not met, but the concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by not more than: ±10.0 percent of the mean concentration; or ±1.0 ppm (whichever is less restrictive), the gas stream is considered to be minimally stratified and you may take samples from three points. Space the three points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line. Alternatively, if a 12-point stratification test was performed and the emissions were shown to be minimally stratified (all points within ± 10.0 percent of their mean or within ±1.0 ppm), and if the stack diameter (or equivalent diameter, for a rectangular stack or duct) is greater than 2.4 meters (7.8 ft), then you may use 3-point sampling and locate the three points along the measurement line exhibiting the highest average concentration during the stratification test at 0.4, 1.2 and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. If the gas stream is found to be stratified because the 10.0 percent or 1.0 ppm criterion for a 3-point test is not met, locate 12 traverse points for the test in accordance with Table 1-1 or Table 1-2 of Method 1.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.2 Initial Measurement System Performance Tests. What initial performance criteria must my system meet before I begin collecting samples?</E> Before measuring emissions, perform the following procedures:</P>
            <P>(a) Calibration gas verification,</P>
            <P>(b) Measurement system preparation,</P>
            <P>(c) Calibration error test,</P>
            <P>(d) NO<E T="52">2</E> to NO conversion efficiency test, if applicable,</P>
            <P>(e) System bias check,</P>
            <P>(f) System response time test, and</P>
            <P>(g) Interference check<PRTPAGE P="294"/>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.2.1 Calibration Gas Verification.</E> How must I verify the concentrations of my calibration gases? Obtain a certificate from the gas manufacturer documenting the quality of the gas. Confirm that the manufacturer certification is complete and current. Ensure that your calibration gas certifications have not expired. This documentation should be available on-site for inspection. To the extent practicable, select a high-level gas concentration that will result in the measured emissions being between 20 and 100 percent of the calibration span.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.2.2 Measurement System Preparation. How do I prepare my measurement system?</E> Assemble, prepare, and precondition the measurement system according to your standard operating procedure. Adjust the system to achieve the correct sampling rate or dilution ratio (as applicable).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.2.3 Calibration Error Test. How do I confirm my analyzer calibration is correct?</E> After you have assembled, prepared and calibrated your sampling system and analyzer, you must conduct a 3-point analyzer calibration error test (or a 3-point system calibration error test for dilution systems) before the first run and again after any failed system bias test (or 2-point system calibration error test for dilution systems) or failed drift test. Introduce the low-, mid-, and high-level calibration gases sequentially. For non-dilution-type measurement systems, introduce the gases in direct calibration mode. For dilution-type measurement systems, introduce the gases in system calibration mode.</P>
            <P>(1) For non-dilution systems, you may adjust the system to maintain the correct flow rate at the analyzer during the test, but you may not make adjustments for any other purpose. For dilution systems, you must operate the measurement system at the appropriate dilution ratio during all system calibration error checks, and may make only the adjustments necessary to maintain the proper ratio.</P>
            <P>(2) Record the analyzer's response to each calibration gas on a form similar to Table 7E-1. For each calibration gas, calculate the analyzer calibration error using Equation 7E-1 in section 12.2 or the system calibration error using Equation 7E-3 in section 12.4 (as applicable). The calibration error specification in section 13.1 must be met for the low-, mid-, and high-level gases. If the calibration error specification is not met, take corrective action and repeat the test until an acceptable 3-point calibration is achieved.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.2.4 NO</E>
              <E T="52">2</E>
              <E T="03">to NO Conversion Efficiency Test.</E> Before or after each field test, you must conduct an NO<E T="52">2</E> to NO conversion efficiency test if your system converts NO<E T="52">2</E> to NO before analyzing for NO<E T="52">X</E>. You may risk testing multiple facilities before performing this test provided you pass this test at the conclusion of the final facility test. A failed final conversion efficiency test in this case will invalidate all tests performed subsequent to the test in which the converter efficiency test was passed. Follow the procedures in section 8.2.4.1, or 8.2.4.2. If desired, the converter efficiency factor derived from this test may be used to correct the test results for converter efficiency if the NO<E T="52">2</E> fraction in the measured test gas is known. Use Equation 7E-8 in section 12.8 for this correction.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1 Introduce NO<E T="52">2</E> converter efficiency gas to the analyzer in direct calibration mode and record the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration displayed by the analyzer. Calculate the converter efficiency using Equation 7E-7 in section 12.7. The specification for converter efficiency in section 13.5 must be met. The user is cautioned that state-of-the-art NO<E T="52">2</E> calibration gases may have limited shelf lives, and this could affect the ability to pass the 90-percent conversion efficiency requirement.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.2 Alternatively, either of the procedures for determining conversion efficiency using NO in section 16.2 may be used.</P>
            <P>8.2.5 Initial System Bias and System Calibration Error Checks. Before sampling begins, determine whether the high-level or mid-level calibration gas best approximates the emissions and use it as the upscale gas. Introduce the upscale gas at the probe upstream of all sample conditioning components in system calibration mode. Record the time it takes for the measured concentration to increase to a value that is at least 95 percent or within 0.5 ppm (whichever is less restrictive) of a stable response for both the low-level and upscale gases. Continue to observe the gas concentration reading until it has reached a final, stable value. Record this value on a form similar to Table 7E-2.</P>
            <P>(1) Next, introduce the low-level gas in system calibration mode and record the time required for the concentration response to decrease to a value that is within 5.0 percent or 0.5 ppm (whichever is less restrictive) of the certified low-range gas concentration. If the low-level gas is a zero gas, use the procedures described above and observe the change in concentration until the response is 0.5 ppm or 5.0 percent of the upscale gas concentration (whichever is less restrictive).</P>
            <P>(2) Continue to observe the low-level gas reading until it has reached a final, stable value and record the result on a form similar to Table 7E-2. Operate the measurement system at the normal sampling rate during all system bias checks. Make only the adjustments necessary to achieve proper calibration gas flow rates at the analyzer.</P>

            <P>(3) From these data, calculate the measurement system response time (see section 8.2.6) and then calculate the initial system bias using Equation 7E-2 in section 12.3. For dilution systems, calculate the system calibration error in lieu of system bias using <PRTPAGE P="295"/>equation 7E-3 in section 12.4. See section 13.2 for acceptable performance criteria for system bias and system calibration error. If the initial system bias (or system calibration error) specification is not met, take corrective action. Then, you must repeat the applicable calibration error test from section 8.2.3 and the initial system bias (or 2-point system calibration error) check until acceptable results are achieved, after which you may begin sampling.
            </P>
            <P>(<E T="04">Note:</E> For dilution-type systems, data from the 3-point system calibration error test described in section 8.2.3 may be used to meet the initial 2-point system calibration error test requirement of this section, if the calibration gases were injected as described in this section, and if response time data were recorded).
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.2.6 Measurement System Response Time.</E> As described in section 8.2.5, you must determine the measurement system response time during the initial system bias (or 2-point system calibration error) check. Observe the times required to achieve 95 percent of a stable response for both the low-level and upscale gases. The longer interval is the response time.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.2.7 Interference Check.</E> Conduct an interference response test of the gas analyzer prior to its initial use in the field. If you have multiple analyzers of the same make and model, you need only perform this alternative interference check on one analyzer. You may also meet the interference check requirement if the instrument manufacturer performs this or a similar check on an analyzer of the same make and model of the analyzer that you use and provides you with documented results.</P>

            <P>(1) You may introduce the appropriate interference test gases (that are potentially encountered during a test; see examples in Table 7E-3) into the analyzer separately or as mixtures. Test the analyzer with the interference gas alone at the highest concentration expected at a test source and again with the interference gas and NO<E T="52">X</E> at a representative NO<E T="52">X</E> test concentration. For analyzers measuring NO<E T="52">X</E> greater than 20 ppm, use a calibration gas with a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration of 80 to 100 ppm and set this concentration equal to the calibration span. For analyzers measuring less than 20 ppm NO<E T="52">X</E>, select an NO concentration for the calibration span that reflects the emission levels at the sources to be tested, and perform the interference check at that level. Measure the total interference response of the analyzer to these gases in ppmv. Record the responses and determine the interference using Table 7E-4. The specification in section 13.4 must be met.</P>

            <P>(2) A copy of this data, including the date completed and signed certification, must be available for inspection at the test site and included with each test report. This interference test is valid for the life of the instrument unless major analytical components (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the detector) are replaced with different model parts. If major components are replaced with different model parts, the interference gas check must be repeated before returning the analyzer to service. If major components are replaced, the interference gas check must be repeated before returning the analyzer to service. The tester must ensure that any specific technology, equipment, or procedures that are intended to remove interference effects are operating properly during testing.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.3 Dilution-Type Systems—Special Considerations.</E> When a dilution-type measurement system is used, there are three important considerations that must be taken into account to ensure the quality of the emissions data. First, the critical orifice size and dilution ratio must be selected properly so that the sample dew point will be below the sample line and analyzer temperatures. Second, a high-quality, accurate probe controller must be used to maintain the dilution ratio during the test. The probe controller should be capable of monitoring the dilution air pressure, eductor vacuum, and sample flow rates. Third, differences between the molecular weight of calibration gas mixtures and the stack gas molecular weight must be addressed because these can affect the dilution ratio and introduce measurement bias.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.4 Sample Collection.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Position the probe at the first sampling point. Purge the system for at least two times the response time before recording any data. Then, traverse all required sampling points, sampling at each point for an equal length of time and maintaining the appropriate sample flow rate or dilution ratio (as applicable). You must record at least one valid data point per minute during the test run.</P>
            <P>(2) Each time the probe is removed from the stack and replaced, you must recondition the sampling system for at least two times the system response time prior to your next recording. If the average of any run exceeds the calibration span value, that run is invalid.</P>
            <P>(3) You may satisfy the multipoint traverse requirement by sampling sequentially using a single-hole probe or a multi-hole probe designed to sample at the prescribed points with a flow within 10 percent of mean flow rate. Notwithstanding, for applications under part 75 of this chapter, the use of multi-hole probes is subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.5 Post-Run System Bias Check and Drift Assessment.</E>
            </P>

            <P>How do I confirm that each sample I collect is valid? After each run, repeat the system bias check or 2-point system calibration error check (for dilution systems) to validate <PRTPAGE P="296"/>the run. Do not make adjustments to the measurement system (other than to maintain the target sampling rate or dilution ratio) between the end of the run and the completion of the post-run system bias or system calibration error check. Note that for all post-run system bias or 2-point system calibration error checks, you may inject the low-level gas first and the upscale gas last, or vice-versa. You may risk sampling for multiple runs before performing the post-run bias or system calibration error check provided you pass this test at the conclusion of the group of runs. A failed final test in this case will invalidate all runs subsequent to the last passed test.</P>
            <P>(1) If you do not pass the post-run system bias (or system calibration error) check, then the run is invalid. You must diagnose and fix the problem and pass another calibration error test (Section 8.2.3) and system bias (or 2-point system calibration error) check (Section 8.2.5) before repeating the run. Record the system bias (or system calibration error) results on a form similar to Table 7E-2.</P>
            <P>(2) After each run, calculate the low-level and upscale drift, using Equation 7E-4 in section 12.5. If the post-run low- and upscale bias (or 2-point system calibration error) checks are passed, but the low-or upscale drift exceeds the specification in section 13.3, the run data are valid, but a 3-point calibration error test and a system bias (or 2-point system calibration error) check must be performed and passed before any more test runs are done.</P>
            <P>(3) For dilution systems, data from a 3-point system calibration error test may be used to met the pre-run 2-point system calibration error requirement for the first run in a test sequence. Also, the post-run bias (or 2-point calibration error) check data may be used as the pre-run data for the next run in the test sequence at the discretion of the tester.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8.6 Alternative Interference and System Bias Checks (Dynamic Spike Procedure). If I want to use the dynamic spike procedure to validate my data, what procedure should I follow?</E> Except for applications under part 75 of this chapter, you may use the dynamic spiking procedure and requirements provided in section 16.1 during each test as an alternative to the interference check and the pre- and post-run system bias checks. The calibration error test is still required under this option. Use of the dynamic spiking procedure for Part 75 applications is subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

              <E T="03">8.7 Moisture correction.</E> You must determine the moisture content of the flue gas and correct the measured gas concentrations to a dry basis using Method 4 or other appropriate methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, when the moisture basis (wet or dry) of the measurements made with this method is different from the moisture basis of either: (1) The applicable emissions limit; or (2) the CEMS being evaluated for relative accuracy. Moisture correction is also required if the applicable limit is in lb/mmBtu and the moisture basis of the Method 7E NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer is different from the moisture basis of the Method 3A diluent gas (CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E>) analyzer.</P>

            <P>(1) The initial 3-point calibration error test as described in section 8.2.3 and the system bias (or system calibration error) checks described in section 8.2.5 are required and must meet the specifications in section 13 before you start the test. Make all necessary adjustments to calibrate the gas analyzer and data recorder. Then, after the test commences, the system bias or system calibration error checks described in section 8.5 are required before and after each run. Your analyzer must be calibrated for all species of NO<E T="52">X</E> that it detects. Analyzers that measure NO and NO<E T="52">2</E> separately without using a converter must be calibrated with both NO and NO<E T="52">2</E>.</P>
            <P>(2) You must include a copy of the manufacturer's certification of the calibration gases used in the testing as part of the test report. This certification must include the 13 documentation requirements in the EPA Traceability Protocol For Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards, September 1997, as amended August 25, 1999. When Method 205 is used to produce diluted calibration gases, you must document that the specifications for the gas dilution system are met for the test. You must also include the date of the most recent dilution system calibration against flow standards and the name of the person or manufacturer who carried out the calibration in the test report.</P>

For part 75 applications, use of this procedure is subject to the approval of the Administrator. <PRTPAGE P="301"/>Best results are obtained for this procedure when source emissions are steady and not varying.

Your procedure must be designed to spike field samples at two target levels both before and after the test. Your target spike levels should bracket the average sample NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations. The higher target concentration must be less than the calibration span. You must collect at least 5 data points for each target concentration. The spiking procedure must be performed before the first run and repeated after the last run of the test program.</P>

              <E T="03">16.1.3 Example Spiking Procedure.</E> Determine the NO concentration needed to generate concentrations that are 50 and 150 percent of the anticipated NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration in the stack at the total sampling flow rate while keeping the spike flow rate at or below 10 percent of this total. Use a mass flow meter (accurate within 2.0 percent) to generate these NO spike gas concentrations at a constant flow rate. Use Equation 7E-11 in section 12.11 to determine the calculated spike concentration in the collected sample.</P>

            <P>(1) Prepare the measurement system and conduct the analyzer calibration error test as described in sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3. Following the sampling procedures in section 8.1, determine the stack NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration and use this concentration as the average stack concentration (C<E T="52">avg</E>) for the first spike level, or if desired, for both pre-test spike levels. Introduce the first level spike gas into the system in system calibration mode and begin sample collection. Wait for at least two times the system response time before measuring the spiked sample concentration. Then record at least five successive 1-minute averages of the spiked sample gas. Monitor the spike gas flow rate and maintain at the determined addition rate. Average the five 1-minute averages and determine the spike recovery using Equation 7E-12. Repeat this procedure for the other pre-test spike level. The recovery at each level must be within the limits in section 13.6 before proceeding with the test.</P>
            <P>(2) Conduct the number of runs required for the test. Then repeat the above procedure for the post-test spike evaluation. The last run of the test may serve as the average stack concentration for the post-test spike test calculations. The results of the post-test spikes must meet the limits in section 13.6.</P>

            <P>16.2.2 Bag Procedure. Perform the analyzer calibration error test to document the calibration (both NO and NO<E T="52">X</E> modes, as applicable). Fill a Tedlar or equivalent bag approximately half full with either ambient air, pure oxygen, or an oxygen standard gas with at least 19.5 percent by volume oxygen content. Fill the remainder of the bag with mid- to high-level NO in N<E T="52">2</E> (or other appropriate concentration) calibration gas. (Note that the concentration of the NO standard should be sufficiently high enough for the diluted concentration to be easily and accurately measured on the scale used. The size of the bag should be large enough to accommodate the procedure and time required. Verify through the manufacturer that the Tedlar alternative is suitable for NO and make this verifed information available for inspection.)</P>
            <P>(1) Immediately attach the bag to the inlet of the NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer (or external converter if used). In the case of a dilution-system, introduce the gas at a point upstream of the dilution assembly. Measure the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration for a period of 30 minutes. If the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration drops more than 2 percent absolute from the peak value observed, then the NO<E T="52">2</E> converter has failed to meet the criteria of this test. Take corrective action. The highest NO<E T="52">X</E> value observed is considered to be NO<E T="52">XPeak</E>.

This test evaluates each analyzer model by subjecting it to the tests listed in Table 7E-5 following procedures similar to those in 40 CFR 53.23 for thermal stability and insensitivity to supply voltage variations. If the analyzer will be used under temperature conditions that are outside the test conditions in Table B-4 of Part 53.23, alternative test temperatures that better reflect the analyzer field environment should be used.

            <P>6.1 Sample Collection. Same as Method 5, section 6.1, with the following additions and exceptions:</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train used in this method is shown in Figure 8-1; it is similar to the Method 5 sampling train, except that the filter position is different, and the filter holder does not have to be heated. See Method 5, section 6.1.1, for details and guidelines on operation and maintenance.</P>

            <P>6.1.1.1 Probe Nozzle. Borosilicate or quartz glass with a sharp, tapered leading edge and coupled to the probe liner using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or glass-lined union (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> fused silica, Slico, or equivalent). When the stack temperature exceeds 210 °C (410 °F), a leak-free ground glass fitting or other leak free, non-contaminating fitting must be used to couple the nozzle to the probe liner. It is also acceptable to use a one-piece glass nozzle/liner assembly. The angle of the taper shall be ≤30°, and the taper shall be on the outside to preserve a constant internal diameter. The probe nozzle shall be of the button-hook or elbow design, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. Other materials of construction may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling should be available. Typical nozzle sizes range from 0.32 to 1.27 cm (<FR>1/8</FR> to <FR>1/2</FR> in) inside diameter (ID) in increments of 0.16 cm (<FR>1/16</FR> in). Larger nozzles sizes are also available if higher volume sampling trains are used.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.2 Probe Liner. Borosilicate or quartz glass, with a heating system to prevent visible condensation during sampling. Do not use metal probe liners.</P>

            <P>6.1.1.3 Filter Holder. Borosilicate glass, with a glass frit filter support and a silicone rubber gasket. Other gasket materials (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Teflon or Viton) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. The holder design shall provide a positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter. The filter holder shall be placed between the first and second impingers. Do not heat the filter holder.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.4 Impingers. Four, of the Greenburg-Smith design, as shown in Figure 8-1. The first and third impingers must have standard tips. The second and fourth impingers must be modified by replacing the insert with an approximately 13-mm (<FR>1/2</FR>-in.) ID glass tube, having an unconstricted tip located 13 mm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) from the bottom of the impinger. Similar collection systems, subject to the approval of the Administrator, may be used.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.5 Temperature Sensor. Thermometer, or equivalent, to measure the temperature of the gas leaving the impinger train to within 1 °C (2 °F).</P>
            <P>6.2 Sample Recovery. The following items are required for sample recovery:</P>
            <P>6.2.1 Wash Bottles. Two polyethylene or glass bottles, 500-ml.</P>

            <P>8.5 Pretest Leak-Check Procedure. Follow the basic procedure in Method 5, section 8.4.2, noting that the probe heater shall be adjusted to the minimum temperature required to prevent condensation, and also that verbage such as “* * * plugging the inlet to the filter holder * * * ” found in section 8.4.2.2 of Method 5 shall be replaced by “ * * * plugging the inlet to the first impinger * * * ”. The pretest leak-check is recommended, but is not required.</P>
            <P>8.6 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the basic procedures in Method 5, section 8.5, in conjunction with the following special instructions:</P>
            <P>8.6.1 Record the data on a sheet similar to that shown in Figure 8-2 (alternatively, Figure 5-2 in Method 5 may be used). The sampling rate shall not exceed 0.030 m<SU>3</SU>/min (1.0 cfm) during the run. Periodically during the test, observe the connecting line between the probe and first impinger for signs of condensation. If condensation does occur, adjust the probe heater setting upward to the minimum temperature required to prevent condensation. If component changes become necessary during a run, a leak-check shall be performed immediately before each change, according to the procedure outlined in section 8.4.3 of Method 5 (with appropriate modifications, as mentioned in section 8.5 of this method); record all leak rates. If the leakage rate(s) exceeds the specified rate, the tester shall either void the run or plan to correct the sample volume as outlined in section 12.3 of Method 5. Leak-checks immediately after component changes are recommended, but not required. If these leak-checks are performed, the procedure in section 8.4.2 of Method 5 (with appropriate modifications) shall be used.</P>
            <P>8.6.2 After turning off the pump and recording the final readings at the conclusion of each run, remove the probe from the stack. Conduct a post-test (mandatory) leak-check as outlined in section 8.4.4 of Method 5 (with appropriate modifications), and record the leak rate. If the post-test leakage rate exceeds the specified acceptable rate, either correct the sample volume, as outlined in section 12.3 of Method 5, or void the run.</P>

            <P>8.6.3 Drain the ice bath and, with the probe disconnected, purge the remaining part of the train by drawing clean ambient air through the system for 15 minutes at the average flow rate used for sampling.

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Method 9—Visual Determination of the Opacity of Emissions From Stationary Sources</HD>

            <P>Many stationary sources discharge visible emissions into the atmosphere; these emissions are usually in the shape of a plume. This method involves the determination of plume opacity by qualified observers. The method includes procedures for the training and certification of observers, and procedures to be used in the field for determination of plume opacity. The appearance of a plume as viewed by an observer depends upon a number of variables, some of which may be controllable and some of which may not be controllable in the field. Variables which can be controlled to an extent to which they no longer exert a significant influence upon <PRTPAGE P="312"/>plume appearance include: Angle of the observer with respect to the plume; angle of the observer with respect to the sun; point of observation of attached and detached steam plume; and angle of the observer with respect to a plume emitted from a rectangular stack with a large length to width ratio. The method includes specific criteria applicable to these variables.</P>
            <P>Other variables which may not be controllable in the field are luminescence and color contrast between the plume and the background against which the plume is viewed. These variables exert an influence upon the appearance of a plume as viewed by an observer, and can affect the ability of the observer to accurately assign opacity values to the observed plume. Studies of the theory of plume opacity and field studies have demonstrated that a plume is most visible and presents the greatest apparent opacity when viewed against a contrasting background. It follows from this, and is confirmed by field trials, that the opacity of a plume, viewed under conditions where a contrasting background is present can be assigned with the greatest degree of accuracy. However, the potential for a positive error is also the greatest when a plume is viewed under such contrasting conditions. Under conditions presenting a less contrasting background, the apparent opacity of a plume is less and approaches zero as the color and luminescence contrast decrease toward zero. As a result, significant negative bias and negative errors can be made when a plume is viewed under less contrasting conditions. A negative bias decreases rather than increases the possibility that a plant operator will be cited for a violation of opacity standards due to observer error.</P>
            <P>Studies have been undertaken to determine the magnitude of positive errors which can be made by qualified observers while reading plumes under contrasting conditions and using the procedures set forth in this method. The results of these studies (field trials) which involve a total of 769 sets of 25 readings each are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) For black plumes (133 sets at a smoke generator), 100 percent of the sets were read with a positive error <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> of less than 7.5 percent opacity; 99 percent were read with a positive error of less than 5 percent opacity.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> For a set, positive error = average opacity determined by observers' 25 observations—average opacity determined from transmissometer's 25 recordings.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(2) For white plumes (170 sets at a smoke generator, 168 sets at a coal-fired power plant, 298 sets at a sulfuric acid plant), 99 percent of the sets were read with a positive error of less than 7.5 percent opacity; 95 percent were read with a positive error of less than 5 percent opacity.</P>
            <P>The positive observational error associated with an average of twenty-five readings is therefore established. The accuracy of the method must be taken into account when determining possible violations of applicable opacity standards.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Principle and Applicability</HD>
            <P>1.1 Principle. The opacity of emissions from stationary sources is determined visually by a qualified observer.</P>
            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of the opacity of emissions from stationary sources pursuant to § 60.11(b) and for qualifying observers for visually determining opacity of emissions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Procedures</HD>
            <P>The observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity of emissions:</P>
            <P>2.1 Position. The qualified observer shall stand at a distance sufficient to provide a clear view of the emissions with the sun oriented in the 140° sector to his back. Consistent with maintaining the above requirement, the observer shall, as much as possible, make his observations from a position such that his line of vision is approximately perpendicular to the plume direction, and when observing opacity of emissions from rectangular outlets (e.g., roof monitors, open baghouses, noncircular stacks), approximately perpendicular to the longer axis of the outlet. The observer's line of sight should not include more than one plume at a time when multiple stacks are involved, and in any case the observer should make his observations with his line of sight perpendicular to the longer axis of such a set of multiple stacks (e.g., stub stacks on baghouses).</P>
            <P>2.2 Field Records. The observer shall record the name of the plant, emission location, type facility, observer's name and affiliation, a sketch of the observer's position relative to the source, and the date on a field data sheet (Figure 9-1). The time, estimated distance to the emission location, approximate wind direction, estimated wind speed, description of the sky condition (presence and color of clouds), and plume background are recorded on a field data sheet at the time opacity readings are initiated and completed.</P>
            <P>2.3 Observations. Opacity observations shall be made at the point of greatest opacity in that portion of the plume where condensed water vapor is not present. The observer shall not look continuously at the plume, but instead shall observe the plume momentarily at 15-second intervals.</P>

            <P>2.3.1 Attached Steam Plumes. When condensed water vapor is present within the <PRTPAGE P="313"/>plume as it emerges from the emission outlet, opacity observations shall be made beyond the point in the plume at which condensed water vapor is no longer visible. The observer shall record the approximate distance from the emission outlet to the point in the plume at which the observations are made.</P>
            <P>2.3.2 Detached Steam Plume. When water vapor in the plume condenses and becomes visible at a distinct distance from the emission outlet, the opacity of emissions should be evaluated at the emission outlet prior to the condensation of water vapor and the formation of the steam plume.</P>
            <P>2.4 Recording Observations. Opacity observations shall be recorded to the nearest 5 percent at 15-second intervals on an observational record sheet. (See Figure 9-2 for an example.) A minimum of 24 observations shall be recorded. Each momentary observation recorded shall be deemed to represent the average opacity of emissions for a 15-second period.</P>
            <P>2.5 Data Reduction. Opacity shall be determined as an average of 24 consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record sheet into sets of 24 consecutive observations. A set is composed of any 24 consecutive observations. Sets need not be consecutive in time and in no case shall two sets overlap. For each set of 24 observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the 24 observations and dividing this sum by 24. If an applicable standard specifies an averaging time requiring more than 24 observations, calculate the average for all observations made during the specified time period. Record the average opacity on a record sheet. (See Figure 9-1 for an example.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Qualifications and Testing</HD>
            <P>3.1 Certification Requirements. To receive certification as a qualified observer, a candidate must be tested and demonstrate the ability to assign opacity readings in 5 percent increments to 25 different black plumes and 25 different white plumes, with an error not to exceed 15 percent opacity on any one reading and an average error not to exceed 7.5 percent opacity in each category. Candidates shall be tested according to the procedures described in section 3.2. Smoke generators used pursuant to section 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke meter which meets the requirements of section 3.3.</P>
            <P>The certification shall be valid for a period of 6 months, at which time the qualification procedure must be repeated by any observer in order to retain certification.</P>
            <P>3.2 Certification Procedure. The certification test consists of showing the candidate a complete run of 50 plumes—25 black plumes and 25 white plumes—generated by a smoke generator. Plumes within each set of 25 black and 25 white runs shall be presented in random order. The candidate assigns an opacity value to each plume and records his observation on a suitable form. At the completion of each run of 50 readings, the score of the candidate is determined. If a candidate fails to qualify, the complete run of 50 readings must be repeated in any retest. The smoke test may be administered as part of a smoke school or training program, and may be preceded by training or familiarization runs of the smoke generator during which candidates are shown black and white plumes of known opacity.</P>
            <P>3.3 Smoke Generator Specifications. Any smoke generator used for the purposes of section 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke meter installed to measure opacity across the diameter of the smoke generator stack. The smoke meter output shall display instack opacity based upon a pathlength equal to the stack exit diameter, on a full 0 to 100 percent chart recorder scale. The smoke meter optical design and performance shall meet the specifications shown in Table 9-1. The smoke meter shall be calibrated as prescribed in section 3.3.1 prior to the conduct of each smoke reading test. At the completion of each test, the zero and span drift shall be checked and if the drift exceeds ±1 percent opacity, the condition shall be corrected prior to conducting any subsequent test runs. The smoke meter shall be demonstrated, at the time of installation, to meet the specifications listed in Table 9-1. This demonstration shall be repeated following any subsequent repair or replacement of the photocell or associated electronic circuitry including the chart recorder or output meter, or every 6 months, whichever occurs first.</P>

When stable response at 0 percent or 100 percent is noted, the smoke meter is adjusted to produce an output of 0 percent or 100 percent, as appropriate. This calibration shall be repeated until stable 0 percent and 100 <PRTPAGE P="314"/>percent readings are produced without adjustment. Simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values may be produced by alternately switching the power to the light source on and off while the smoke generator is not producing smoke.</P>
            <P>3.3.2 Smoke Meter Evaluation. The smoke meter design and performance are to be evaluated as follows:</P>
            <P>3.3.2.1 Light Source. Verify from manufacturer's data and from voltage measurements made at the lamp, as installed, that the lamp is operated within ±5 percent of the nominal rated voltage.</P>
            <P>3.3.2.2 Spectral Response of Photocell. Verify from manufacturer's data that the photocell has a photopic response; i.e., the spectral sensitivity of the cell shall closely approximate the standard spectral-luminosity curve for photopic vision which is referenced in (b) of Table 9-1.</P>

The total angle of view may be calculated from: θ = 2 tan<E T="51">−1</E>d/2L, where θ = total angle of view; d = the sum of the photocell diameter + the diameter of the limiting aperture; and L = the distance from the photocell to the limiting aperture. The limiting aperture is the point in the path between the photocell and the smoke plume where the angle of view is most restricted. In smoke generator smoke meters this is normally an orifice plate.</P>

            <P>3.3.2.4 Angle of Projection. Check construction geometry to ensure that the total angle of projection of the lamp on the smoke plume does not exceed 15°. The total angle of projection may be calculated from: θ = 2 tan<E T="51">−1</E>d/2L, where θ = total angle of projection; d = the sum of the length of the lamp <PRTPAGE P="318"/>filament + the diameter of the limiting aperture; and L = the distance from the lamp to the limiting aperture.</P>
            <P>3.3.2.5 Calibration Error. Using neutral-density filters of known opacity, check the error between the actual response and the theoretical linear response of the smoke meter. This check is accomplished by first calibrating the smoke meter according to 3.3.1 and then inserting a series of three neutral-density filters of nominal opacity of 20, 50, and 75 percent in the smoke meter pathlength. Filters calibrated within ±2 percent shall be used. Care should be taken when inserting the filters to prevent stray light from affecting the meter. Make a total of five nonconsecutive readings for each filter. The maximum error on any one reading shall be 3 percent opacity.</P>
            <P>3.3.2.6 Zero and Span Drift. Determine the zero and span drift by calibrating and operating the smoke generator in a normal manner over a 1-hour period. The drift is measured by checking the zero and span at the end of this period.</P>
            <P>3.3.2.7 Response Time. Determine the response time by producing the series of five simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values and observing the time required to reach stable response. Opacity values of 0 percent and 100 percent may be simulated by alternately switching the power to the light source off and on while the smoke generator is not operating.</P>

            <P>This alternate method provides the quantitative determination of the opacity of an emissions plume remotely by a mobile lidar system (laser radar; Light Detection and Ranging). The method includes procedures for the calibration of the lidar and procedures to be used in the field for the lidar determination of plume opacity.

            <P>The mobile lidar calibrated in accordance with Paragraph 3 of this method shall use the following procedures for remotely measuring the opacity of stationary source emissions:</P>

            <P>2.1 Lidar Position. The lidar shall be positioned at a distance from the plume sufficient to provide an unobstructed view of the source emissions. The plume must be at a range of at least 50 meters or three consecutive pick intervals (whichever is greater) from the lidar's transmitter/receiver convergence distance along the line-of-sight. The maximum effective opacity measurement distance of the lidar is a function of local atmospheric conditions, laser beam diameter, and plume diameter. The test position of the lidar shall be selected so that the diameter of the laser beam at the measurement point within the plume shall be no larger than three-fourths the plume diameter. The beam diameter is calculated by Equation (AM1-1):
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D(lidar) = A + Rφ≤0.75 D(Plume) (AM1-1)</FP>
            
            <FP>Where:</FP>
            
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D(Plume) = diameter of the plume (cm),</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">φ = laser beam divergence measured in radians</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">R = range from the lidar to the source (cm)</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D(Lidar) = diameter of the laser beam at range R (cm),</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">A = diameter of the laser beam or pulse where it leaves the laser.</FP>
            
            <FP>The lidar range, R, is obtained by aiming and firing the laser at the emissions source structure immediately below the outlet. The range value is then determined from the backscatter signal which consists of a signal spike (return from source structure) and the atmospheric backscatter signal [Reference 5.1]. This backscatter signal should be recorded.</FP>
            <P>When there is more than one source of emissions in the immediate vicinity of the plume, the lidar shall be positioned so that the laser beam passes through only a single plume, free from any interference of the other plumes for a minimum of 50 meters or three consecutive pick intervals (whichever is greater) in each region before and beyond the plume along the line-of-sight (determined from the backscatter signals). The lidar shall initially be positioned so that its line-of-sight is approximately perpendicular to the plume.</P>
            <P>When measuring the opacity of emissions from rectangular outlets (e.g., roof monitors, open baghouses, noncircular stacks, etc.), the lidar shall be placed in a position so that its line-of-sight is approximately perpendicular to the longer (major) axis of the outlet.</P>
            <P>2.2 Lidar Operational Restrictions. The lidar receiver shall not be aimed within an angle of ±15° (cone angle) of the sun.</P>
            <P>This method shall not be used to make opacity measurements if thunderstorms, snowstorms, hail storms, high wind, high-ambient dust levels, fog or other atmospheric conditions cause the reference signals to consistently exceed the limits specified in section 2.3.</P>
            <P>2.3 Reference Signal Requirements. Once placed in its proper position for opacity measurement, the laser is aimed and fired with the line-of-sight near the outlet height and rotated horizontally to a position clear of the source structure and the associated plume. The backscatter signal obtained from this position is called the ambient-air or reference signal. The lidar operator shall inspect this signal [Section V of Reference 5.1] to: (1) determine if the lidar line-of-sight is free from interference from other plumes and from physical obstructions such as cables, power lines, etc., for a minimum of 50 meters or three consecutive pick intervals (whichever is greater) in each region before and beyond the plume, and (2) obtain a qualitative measure of the homogeneity of the ambient air by noting any signal spikes.</P>
            <P>Should there be any signal spikes on the reference signal within a minimum of 50 meters or three consecutive pick intervals (whichever is greater) in each region before and beyond the plume, the laser shall be fired three more times and the operator shall inspect the reference signals on the display. If the spike(s) remains, the azimuth angle shall be changed and the above procedures conducted again. If the spike(s) disappears in all three reference signals, the lidar line-of-sight is acceptable if there is shot-to-shot consistency and there is no interference from other plumes.</P>

            <P>Shot-to-shot consistency of a series of reference signals over a period of twenty seconds is verified in either of two ways. (1) The lidar operator shall observe the reference signal amplitudes. For shot-to-shot consistency the ratio of R<E T="52">f</E> to R<E T="52">n</E> [amplitudes of the near and far region pick intervals (Section 2.6.1)] shall vary by not more than ±6% between shots; or (2) the lidar operator shall accept any one of the reference signals and <PRTPAGE P="320"/>treat the other two as plume signals; then the opacity for each of the subsequent reference signals is calculated (Equation AM1-2). For shot-to-shot consistency, the opacity values shall be within ±3% of 0% opacity and the associated S<E T="52">o</E> values less than or equal to 8% (full scale) [Section 2.6].</P>
            <P>If a set of reference signals fails to meet the requirements of this section, then all plume signals [Section 2.4] from the last set of acceptable reference signals to the failed set shall be discarded.</P>
            <P>2.3.1 Initial and Final Reference Signals. Three reference signals shall be obtained within a 90-second time period prior to any data run. A final set of three reference signals shall be obtained within three (3) minutes after the completion of the same data run.</P>

            <P>2.3.2 Temporal Criterion for Additional Reference Signals. An additional set of reference signals shall be obtained during a data run if there is a change in wind direction or plume drift of 30° or more from the direction that was prevalent when the last set of reference signals was obtained. An additional set of reference signals shall also be obtained if there is an increase in value of S<E T="52">In</E> (near region standard deviation, Equation AM1-5) or S<E T="52">If</E> (far region standard deviation, Equation AM1-6) that is greater than 6% (full scale) over the respective values calculated from the immediately previous plume signal, and this increase in value remains for 30 seconds or longer. An additional set of reference signals shall also be obtained if there is a change in amplitude in either the near or the far region of the plume signal, that is greater than 6% of the near signal amplitude and this change in amplitude remains for 30 seconds or more.</P>
            <P>2.4 Plume Signal Requirements. Once properly aimed, the lidar is placed in operation with the nominal pulse or firing rate of six pulses/minute (1 pulse/10 seconds). The lidar operator shall observe the plume backscatter signals to determine the need for additional reference signals as required by section 2.3.2. The plume signals are recorded from lidar start to stop and are called a data run. The length of a data run is determined by operator discretion. Short-term stops of the lidar to record additional reference signals do not constitute the end of a data run if plume signals are resumed within 90 seconds after the reference signals have been recorded, and the total stop or interrupt time does not exceed 3 minutes.</P>
            <P>2.4.1 Non-hydrated Plumes. The laser shall be aimed at the region of the plume which displays the greatest opacity. The lidar operator must visually verify that the laser is aimed clearly above the source exit structure.</P>
            <P>2.4.2 Hydrated Plumes. The lidar will be used to measure the opacity of hydrated or so-called steam plumes. As listed in the reference method, there are two types, i.e., attached and detached steam plumes.</P>
            <P>2.4.2.1 Attached Steam Plumes. When condensed water vapor is present within a plume, lidar opacity measurements shall be made at a point within the residual plume where the condensed water vapor is no longer visible. The laser shall be aimed into the most dense region (region of highest opacity) of the residual plume.</P>
            <P>During daylight hours the lidar operator locates the most dense portion of the residual plume visually. During nighttime hours a high-intensity spotlight, night vision scope, or low light level TV, etc., can be used as an aid to locate the residual plume. If visual determination is ineffective, the lidar may be used to locate the most dense region of the residual plume by repeatedly measuring opacity, along the longitudinal axis or center of the plume from the emissions outlet to a point just beyond the steam plume. The lidar operator should also observe color differences and plume reflectivity to ensure that the lidar is aimed completely within the residual plume. If the operator does not obtain a clear indication of the location of the residual plume, this method shall not be used.</P>
            <P>Once the region of highest opacity of the residual plume has been located, aiming adjustments shall be made to the laser line-of-sight to correct for the following: movement to the region of highest opacity out of the lidar line-of-sight (away from the laser beam) for more than 15 seconds, expansion of the steam plume (air temperature lowers and/or relative humidity increases) so that it just begins to encroach on the field-of-view of the lidar's optical telescope receiver, or a decrease in the size of the steam plume (air temperature higher and/or relative humidity decreases) so that regions within the residual plume whose opacity is higher than the one being monitored, are present.</P>
            <P>2.4.2.2 Detached Steam Plumes. When the water vapor in a hydrated plume condenses and becomes visible at a finite distance from the stack or source emissions outlet, the opacity of the emissions shall be measured in the region of the plume clearly above the emissions outlet and below condensation of the water vapor.</P>

            <P>During daylight hours the lidar operators can visually determine if the steam plume is detached from the stack outlet. During nighttime hours a high-intensity spotlight, night vision scope, low light level TV, etc., can be used as an aid in determining if the steam plume is detached. If visual determination is ineffective, the lidar may be used to determine if the steam plume is detached by repeatedly measuring plume opacity from the outlet to the steam plume along the plume's longitudinal axis or center line. The lidar operator should also observe color differences and plume reflectivity to detect a <PRTPAGE P="321"/>detached plume. If the operator does not obtain a clear indication of the location of the detached plume, this method shall not be used to make opacity measurements between the outlet and the detached plume.</P>
            <P>Once the determination of a detached steam plume has been confirmed, the laser shall be aimed into the region of highest opacity in the plume between the outlet and the formation of the steam plume. Aiming adjustments shall be made to the lidar's line-of-sight within the plume to correct for changes in the location of the most dense region of the plume due to changes in wind direction and speed or if the detached steam plume moves closer to the source outlet encroaching on the most dense region of the plume. If the detached steam plume should move too close to the source outlet for the lidar to make interference-free opacity measurements, this method shall not be used.</P>
            <P>2.5 Field Records. In addition to the recording recommendations listed in other sections of this method the following records should be maintained. Each plume measured should be uniquely identified. The name of the facility, type of facility, emission source type, geographic location of the lidar with respect to the plume, and plume characteristics should be recorded. The date of the test, the time period that a source was monitored, the time (to the nearest second) of each opacity measurement, and the sample interval should also be recorded. The wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, visibility (measured at the lidar's position), and cloud cover should be recorded at the beginning and end of each time period for a given source. A small sketch depicting the location of the laser beam within the plume should be recorded.</P>
            <P>If a detached or attached steam plume is present at the emissions source, this fact should be recorded. Figures AM1-I and AM1-II are examples of logbook forms that may be used to record this type of data. Magnetic tape or paper tape may also be used to record data.</P>

            <P>2.6 Opacity Calculation and Data Analysis. Referring to the reference signal and plume signal in Figure AM1-III, the measured opacity (O<E T="52">p</E>) in percent for each lidar measurement is calculated using Equation AM1-2.

            <P>The first step in selecting the pick intervals for Equation AM1-2 is to divide the plume signal amplitude by the reference signal amplitude at the same respective ranges to obtain a “normalized” signal. The pick intervals selected using this normalized signal, are a minimum of 15 m (100 nanoseconds) in length and consist of at least 5 contiguous sample intervals. In addition, the following criteria, listed in order of importance, govern pick interval selection. (1) The intervals shall be in a region of the normalized signal where the reference signal meets the requirements of section 2.3 and is everywhere greater than zero. (2) The intervals (near and far) with the minimum average amplitude are chosen. (3) If more than one interval with the same minimum average amplitude is found, the interval closest to the plume is chosen. (4) The standard deviation, S<E T="52">o</E>, for the calculated opacity shall be 8% or less. (S<E T="52">o</E> is calculated by Equation AM1-7).</P>
            <P>If S<E T="52">o</E> is greater than 8%, then the far pick interval shall be changed to the next interval of minimal average amplitude. If S<E T="52">o</E> is still greater than 8%, then this procedure is repeated for the far pick interval. This procedure may be repeated once again for the near pick interval, but if S<E T="52">o</E> remains greater than 8%, the plume signal shall be discarded.</P>
            <P>The reference signal pick intervals, R<E T="52">n</E> and R<E T="52">f</E>, must be chosen over the same time interval as the plume signal pick intervals, I<E T="52">n</E> and I<E T="52">f</E>, respectively [Figure AM1-III]. Other methods of selecting pick intervals may be used if they give equivalent results. Field-oriented examples of pick interval selection are available in Reference 5.1.</P>

If the azimuth angle correction to opacity specified in this section is performed, then the elevation angle correction specified in section 2.6.2 shall not be performed. When opacity is measured in the residual region of an attached steam plume, and the lidar line-of-sight is not perpendicular to the plume, it may be necessary to correct the opacity measured by the lidar to obtain the opacity that would be measured on a path perpendicular to the plume. The following method, or any other method which produces equivalent results, shall be used to determine the need for a correction, to calculate the correction, and to document the point within the plume at which the opacity was measured.</P>

            <P>Figure AM1-IV(b) shows the geometry of the opacity correction. L′ is the path through the plume along which the opacity measurement is made. P′ is the path perpendicular to the plume at the same point. The angle ε is the angle between L′ and the plume center line. The angle (π/2-ε), is the angle between the L′ and P′. The measured opacity, O<E T="52">p</E>, measured along the path L′ shall be corrected to obtain the corrected opacity, O<E T="52">pc</E>, for the path P′, using Equation (AM1-8).</P>

            <P>The lidar shall be subjected to two types of performance verifications that shall be performed in the field. The annual calibration, conducted at least once a year, shall be used to directly verify operation and performance of the entire lidar system. The routine verification, conducted for each emission source measured, shall be used to insure proper performance of the optical receiver and associated electronics.</P>
            <P>3.1 Annual Calibration Procedures. Either a plume from a smoke generator or screen targets shall be used to conduct this calibration.</P>
            <P>If the screen target method is selected, five screens shall be fabricated by placing an opaque mesh material over a narrow frame (wood, metal extrusion, etc.). The screen shall have a surface area of at least one square meter. The screen material should be chosen for precise optical opacities of about 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80%. Opacity of each target shall be optically determined and should be recorded. If a smoke generator plume is selected, it shall meet the requirements of section 3.3 of Reference Method 9. This calibration shall be performed in the field during calm (as practical) atmospheric conditions. The lidar shall be positioned in accordance with section 2.1.</P>
            <P>The screen targets must be placed perpendicular to and coincident with the lidar line-of-sight at sufficient height above the ground (suggest about 30 ft) to avoid ground-level dust contamination. Reference signals shall be obtained just prior to conducting the calibration test.</P>
            <P>The lidar shall be aimed through the center of the plume within 1 stack diameter of the exit, or through the geometric center of the screen target selected. The lidar shall be set in operation for a 6-minute data run at a nominal pulse rate of 1 pulse every 10 seconds. Each backscatter return signal and each respective opacity value obtained from the smoke generator transmissometer, shall be obtained in temporal coincidence. The data shall be analyzed and reduced in accordance with section 2.6 of this method. This calibration shall be performed for 0% (clean air), and at least five other opacities (nominally 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80%).</P>
            <P>The average of the lidar opacity values obtained during a 6-minute calibration run shall be calculated and should be recorded. Also the average of the opacity values obtained from the smoke generator transmissometer for the same 6-minute run shall be calculated and should be recorded.</P>
            <P>Alternate calibration procedures that do not meet the above requirements but produce equivalent results may be used.</P>
            <P>3.2 Routine Verification Procedures. Either one of two techniques shall be used to conduct this verification. It shall be performed at least once every 4 hours for each emission source measured. The following parameters shall be directly verified.</P>
            <P>1) The opacity value of 0% plus a minimum of 5 (nominally 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80%) opacity values shall be verified through the PMT detector and data processing electronics.</P>
            <P>2) The zero-signal level (receiver signal with no optical signal from the source present) shall be inspected to insure that no spurious noise is present in the signal. With the entire lidar receiver and analog/digital electronics turned on and adjusted for normal operating performance, the following procedures shall be used for Techniques 1 and 2, respectively.</P>
            <P>3.2.1 Procedure for Technique 1. This test shall be performed with no ambient or stray light reaching the PMT detector. The narrow band filter (694.3 nanometers peak) shall be removed from its position in front of the PMT detector. Neutral density filters of nominal opacities of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80% shall be used. The recommended test configuration is depicted in Figure AM1-VI.</P>
            <GPH DEEP="447" SPAN="2">
              <PRTPAGE P="333"/>
              <GID>EC01JN92.175</GID>
            </GPH>
            <P>The zero-signal level shall be measured and should be recorded, as indicated in Figure AM1-VI(a). This simulated clear-air or 0% opacity value shall be tested in using the selected light source depicted in Figure AM1-VI(b).</P>

            <P>The light source either shall be a continuous wave (CW) laser with the beam mechanically chopped or a light emitting diode controlled with a pulse generator (rectangular pulse). (A laser beam may have to be attenuated so as not to saturate the PMT detector). This signal level shall be measured <PRTPAGE P="334"/>and should be recorded. The opacity value is calculated by taking two pick intervals [Section 2.6] about 1 microsecond apart in time and using Equation (AM1-2) setting the ratio R<E T="52">n</E>/R<E T="52">f</E> = 1. This calculated value should be recorded.</P>

            <P>The simulated clear-air signal level is also employed in the optical test using the neutral density filters. Using the test configuration in Figure AM1-VI(c), each neutral density filter shall be separately placed into the light path from the light source to the PMT detector. The signal level shall be measured and should be recorded. The opacity value for each filter is calculated by taking the signal level for that respective filter (I<E T="52">f</E>), dividing it by the 0% opacity signal level (I<E T="52">n</E>) and performing the remainder of the calculation by Equation (AM1-2) with R<E T="52">n</E>/R<E T="52">f</E> = 1. The calculated opacity value for each filter should be recorded.</P>
            <P>The neutral density filters used for Technique 1 shall be calibrated for actual opacity with accuracy of ±2% or better. This calibration shall be done monthly while the filters are in use and the calibrated values should be recorded.</P>
            <P>3.2.2 Procedure for Technique 2. An optical generator (built-in calibration mechanism) that contains a light-emitting diode (red light for a lidar containing a ruby laser) is used. By injecting an optical signal into the lidar receiver immediately ahead of the PMT detector, a backscatter signal is simulated. With the entire lidar receiver electronics turned on and adjusted for normal operating performance, the optical generator is turned on and the simulation signal (corrected for 1/R<SU>2</SU>) is selected with no plume spike signal and with the opacity value equal to 0%. This simulated clear-air atmospheric return signal is displayed on the system's video display. The lidar operator then makes any fine adjustments that may be necessary to maintain the system's normal operating range.</P>
            <P>The opacity values of 0% and the other five values are selected one at a time in any order. The simulated return signal data should be recorded. The opacity value shall be calculated. This measurement/calculation shall be performed at least three times for each selected opacity value. While the order is not important, each of the opacity values from the optical generator shall be verified. The calibrated optical generator opacity value for each selection should be recorded.</P>
            <P>The optical generator used for Technique 2 shall be calibrated for actual opacity with an accuracy of ±1% or better. This calibration shall be done monthly while the generator is in use and calibrated value should be recorded.</P>
            <P>Alternate verification procedures that do not meet the above requirements but produce equivalent results may be used.</P>
            <P>3.3 Deviation. The permissible error for the annual calibration and routine verification are:</P>
            <P>3.3.1 Annual Calibration Deviation.</P>
            <P>3.3.1.1 Smoke Generator. If the lidar-measured average opacity for each data run is not within ±5% (full scale) of the respective smoke generator's average opacity over the range of 0% through 80%, then the lidar shall be considered out of calibration.</P>
            <P>3.3.1.2 Screens. If the lidar-measured average opacity for each data run is not within ±3% (full scale) of the laboratory-determined opacity for each respective simulation screen target over the range of 0% through 80%, then the lidar shall be considered out of calibration.</P>
            <P>3.3.2 Routine Verification Error. If the lidar-measured average opacity for each neutral density filter (Technique 1) or optical generator selection (Technique 2) is not within ±3% (full scale) of the respective laboratory calibration value then the lidar shall be considered non-operational.</P>

            <P>Method 10 is a procedure for measuring carbon monoxide (CO) in stationary source emissions using a continuous instrumental analyzer. Quality assurance and quality control requirements are included to assure that you, the tester, collect data of known quality. You must document your adherence to these specific requirements for equipment, supplies, sample collection and analysis, calculations, and data analysis. This method does not completely describe all equipment, supplies, and sampling and analytical procedures you will need but refers to other methods for some of the details. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, you should also have a thorough knowledge of these additional test methods which are found in appendix A to this part:</P>

            <P>Sulfur oxides, nitric oxide, and other acid gases interfere with the colorimetric reaction. They are removed by passing the sampled gas through an alkaline potassium permanganate scrubbing solution. Carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) does not interfere, but, because it is removed by the scrubbing solution, its concentration must be measured independently and an appropriate volume correction made to the sampled gas.</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Evacuate the bag with a leakless pump that is connected to the downstream side of a flow indicating device such as a 0- to 100-ml/min rotameter or an impinger containing water. When the bag is completely evacuated, no flow should be evident if the bag is leak-free.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sample Collection.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Evacuate and leak check the sample bag or tank as specified in section 8.1. Assemble the apparatus as shown in Figure 10A-1. Loosely pack glass wool in the tip of the probe. Place 400 ml of alkaline permanganate solution in the first two impingers and 250 ml in the third. Connect the pump to the third impinger, and follow this with the surge tank, rate meter, and 3-way valve. Do not connect the bag or sample tank to the system at this time.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Leak-check the sampling system by plugging the probe inlet, opening the 3-way valve, and pulling a vacuum of approximately 250 mm Hg on the system while observing the rate meter for flow. If flow is indicated on the rate meter, do not proceed further until the leak is found and corrected.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Purge the system with sample gas by inserting the probe into the stack and drawing the sample gas through the system at 300 ml/min ±10 percent for 5 minutes. Connect the evacuated bag or sample tank to the system, record the starting time, and sample at a rate of 300 ml/min for 30 minutes, or until the bag is nearly full, or the sample tank reaches ambient pressure. Record the sampling time, the barometric pressure, and the ambient temperature. Purge the system as described above immediately before each sample.</P>

            <P>8.2.4 The scrubbing solution is adequate for removing sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides from 50 liters (1.8 ft<SU>3</SU>) of stack gas when the concentration of each is less than 1,000 ppm and the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration is less than 15 percent. Replace the scrubber solution after every fifth sample.</P>
            <P>8.3 Carbon Dioxide Measurement. Measure the CO<E T="52">2</E> content in the stack to the nearest 0.5 percent each time a CO sample is collected. A simultaneous grab sample analyzed by the Fyrite analyzer is acceptable.</P>

            <P>10.1 Gas Bulb Calibration. Weigh the empty bulb to the nearest 0.1 g. Fill the bulb to the stopcock with water, and again weigh to the nearest 0.1 g. Subtract the tare weight, and calculate the volume in liters to three significant figures using the density of water at the measurement temperature. Record the volume on the bulb. Alternatively, mark an identification number on the bulb, and record the volume in a notebook.</P>
            <P>10.2 Rate Meter Calibration. Assemble the system as shown in Figure 10A-1 (the impingers may be removed), and attach a volume meter to the probe inlet. Set the rotameter at 300 ml/min, record the volume meter reading, start the pump, and pull ambient air through the system for 10 minutes. Record the final volume meter reading. Repeat the procedure and average the results to determine the volume of gas that passed through the system.</P>
            <P>10.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Curve.</P>

            <P>10.3.1 Collect the standards as described in section 8.2. Prepare at least two sets of three bulbs as standards to span the 0 to 400 or 400 to 1000 ppm range. If any samples span both <PRTPAGE P="342"/>concentration ranges, prepare a calibration curve for each range using separate reagent blanks. Prepare a set of three bulbs containing colorimetric reagent but no CO to serve as a reagent blank. Analyze each standard and blank according to the sample analysis procedure of section 11.0 Reject the standard set where any of the individual bulb absorbances differs from the set mean by more than 10 percent.</P>
            <P>10.3.2 Calculate the average absorbance for each set (3 bulbs) of standards using Equation 10A-1 and Table 10A-1. Construct a graph of average absorbance for each standard against its corresponding concentration. Draw a smooth curve through the points. The curve should be linear over the two concentration ranges discussed in section 13.3.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>
            <P>11.1 Assemble the system shown in Figure 10A-3, and record the information required in Table 10A-1 as it is obtained. Pipet 10.0 ml of the colorimetric reagent into each gas reaction bulb, and attach the bulbs to the system. Open the stopcocks to the reaction bulbs, but leave the valve to the bag closed. Turn on the pump, fully open the coarse-adjust flow valve, and slowly open the fine-adjust valve until the pressure is reduced to at least 40 mm Hg. Now close the coarse adjust valve, and observe the manometer to be certain that the system is leak-free. Wait a minimum of 2 minutes. If the pressure has increased less than 1 mm Hg, proceed as described below. If a leak is present, find and correct it before proceeding further.</P>
            <P>11.2 Record the vacuum pressure (P<E T="52">v</E>) to the nearest 1 mm Hg, and close the reaction bulb stopcocks. Open the bag valve, and allow the system to come to atmospheric pressure. Close the bag valve, open the pump coarse adjust valve, and evacuate the system again. Repeat this fill/evacuation procedure at least twice to flush the manifold completely. Close the pump coarse adjust valve, open the bag valve, and let the system fill to atmospheric pressure. Open the stopcocks to the reaction bulbs, and let the entire system come to atmospheric pressure. Close the bulb stopcocks, remove the bulbs, record the room temperature and barometric pressure (P<E T="52">bar</E>, to nearest mm Hg), and place the bulbs on the shaker table with their main axis either parallel to or perpendicular to the plane of the table top. Purge the bulb-filling system with ambient air for several minutes between samples. Shake the samples for exactly 2 hours.</P>

            <P>11.3 Immediately after shaking, measure the absorbance (A) of each bulb sample at 425 nm if the concentration is less than or equal to 400 ppm CO or at 600 nm if the concentration is above 400 ppm.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>This may be accomplished with multiple bulb sets by sequentially collecting sets and adding to the shaker at staggered intervals, followed by sequentially removing sets from the shaker for absorbance measurement after the two-hour designated intervals have elapsed.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>11.4 Use a small portion of the sample to rinse a spectrophotometer cell several times before taking an aliquot for analysis. If one cell is used to analyze multiple samples, rinse the cell with deionized distilled water several times between samples. Prepare and analyze standards and a reagent blank as described in section 10.3. Use water as the reference. Reject the analysis if the blank absorbance is greater than 0.1. All conditions should be the same for analysis of samples and standards. Measure the absorbances as soon as possible after shaking is completed.</P>
            <P>11.5 Determine the CO concentration of each bag sample using the calibration curve for the appropriate concentration range as discussed in section 10.3.</P>

            <P>13.3 Range. Approximately 3 to 1800 ppm CO. Samples having concentrations below 400 ppm are analyzed at 425 nm, and samples having concentrations above 400 ppm are analyzed at 600 nm.</P>
            <P>13.4 Sensitivity. The detection limit is 3 ppmv based on a change in concentration equal to three times the standard deviation of the reagent blank solution.</P>
            <P>13.5 Stability. The individual components of the colorimetric reagent are stable for at least one month. The colorimetric reagent must be used within two days after preparation to avoid excessive blank correction.

            <P>2.1 An integrated gas sample is extracted from the sampling point, passed through a conditioning system to remove interferences, and collected in a Tedlar or equivalent bag. (Verify through the manufacturer that the Tedlar alternative is suitable for NO and make this verifying information available for inspection.) The CO is separated from the sample by gas chromatography (GC) and catalytically reduced to methane (CH<E T="52">4</E>) which is determined by flame ionization detection (FID). The analytical portion of this method is identical to applicable sections in Method 25 detailing CO measurement.<PRTPAGE P="349"/>

            <P>10.2 Reduction Catalyst Efficiency Check. Prior to initial use, the reduction catalyst shall be tested for reduction efficiency. With the heated reduction catalyst bypassed, make triplicate injections of the 1,000 ppm CH<E T="52">4</E> gas (Section 7.2.3) to calibrate the analyzer. Repeat the procedure using 1,000 ppm CO gas (Section 7.2.2) with the catalyst in operation. The reduction catalyst operation is acceptable if the CO response is within 5 percent of the certified gas value.</P>

            <P>10.3 Analyzer Calibration. Perform this test before the system is first placed into operation. With the reduction catalyst in operation, conduct a linearity check of the analyzer using the standards specified in section 7.2.2. Make triplicate injections of each calibration gas, and then calculate the average <PRTPAGE P="350"/>response factor (area/ppm) for each gas, as well as the overall mean of the response factor values. The instrument linearity is acceptable if the average response factor of each calibration gas is within 2.5 percent of the overall mean value and if the relative standard deviation (calculated in section 12.8 of Method 25) for each set of triplicate injections is less than 2 percent.

            <P>The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.</P>

            <P>Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods <PRTPAGE P="351"/>to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.</P>
            <P>Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.</P>
            <P>The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.</P>
            <P>Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.</P>
            <P>Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 A sample is extracted from a source and passed through a series of midget impingers containing a cadmium sulfate (CdSO<E T="52">4</E>) solution; H<E T="52">2</E>S is absorbed, forming cadmium sulfide (CdS). The latter compound is then measured iodometrically.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>
            <P>4.1 Any compound that reduces iodine (I<E T="52">2</E>) or oxidizes the iodide ion will interfere in this procedure, provided it is collected in the CdSO<E T="52">4</E> impingers. Sulfur dioxide in concentrations of up to 2,600 mg/m<SU>3</SU> is removed <PRTPAGE P="352"/>with an impinger containing a hydrogen peroxide (H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>) solution. Thiols precipitate with H<E T="52">2</E>S. In the absence of H<E T="52">2</E>S, only traces of thiols are collected. When methane-and ethane-thiols at a total level of 300 mg/m<SU>3</SU> are present in addition to H<E T="52">2</E>S, the results vary from 2 percent low at an H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration of 400 mg/m<SU>3</SU> to 14 percent high at an H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration of 100 mg/m<SU>3</SU>. Carbonyl sulfide at a concentration of 20 percent does not interfere. Certain carbonyl-containing compounds react with iodine and produce recurring end points. However, acetaldehyde and acetone at concentrations of 1 and 3 percent, respectively, do not interfere.</P>
            <P>4.2 Entrained H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> produces a negative interference equivalent to 100 percent of that of an equimolar quantity of H<E T="52">2</E>S. Avoid the ejection of H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> into the CdSO<E T="52">4</E> impingers.</P>

            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Do not use more than 30 g of silica gel. Silica gel adsorbs gases such as propane from the fuel gas stream, and use of excessive amounts of silica gel could result in errors in the determination of sample volume.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>6.1.6 Sampling Valve. Needle valve, or equivalent, to adjust gas flow rate. Stainless steel or other corrosion-resistant material.</P>
            <P>6.1.7 Volume Meter. Dry gas meter (DGM), sufficiently accurate to measure the sample volume within 2 percent, calibrated at the selected flow rate (about 1.0 liter/min) and conditions actually encountered during sampling. The meter shall be equipped with a temperature sensor (dial thermometer or equivalent) capable of measuring temperature to within 3 °C (5.4 °F). The gas meter should have a petcock, or equivalent, on the outlet connector which can be closed during the leak-check. Gas volume for one revolution of the meter must not be more than 10 liters.</P>

            <P>8.1 Sampling Train Preparation. Assemble the sampling train as shown in Figure 11-1, connecting the five midget impingers in series. Place 15 ml of 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> solution in the first impinger. Leave the second impinger empty. Place 15 ml of the CdSO<E T="52">4</E> solution in the third, fourth, and fifth impingers. Place the impinger assembly in an ice water bath container, and place water and crushed ice around the impingers. Add more ice during the run, if needed.</P>
            <P>8.2 Leak-Check Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Connect the rubber bulb and manometer to the first impinger, as shown in Figure 11-1. Close the petcock on the DGM outlet. Pressurize the train to 25 cm water with the bulb, and close off the tubing connected to the rubber bulb. The train must hold 25 cm water pressure with not more than a 1 cm drop in pressure in a 1-minute interval. Stopcock grease is acceptable for sealing ground glass joints.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 If the pump is used for sampling, it is recommended, but not required, that the pump be leak-checked separately, either prior to or after the sampling run. To leak-check the pump, proceed as follows: Disconnect the drying tube from the impinger assembly. Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to either the drying tube or the pump, pull a vacuum of 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg), plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum should remain stable for at least 30 seconds. If performed prior to the sampling run, the pump leak-check should precede the leak-check of the sampling train described immediately above; if performed after the sampling run, the pump leak-check should follow the sampling train leak-check.</P>
            <P>8.3 Purge the connecting line between the sampling valve and the first impinger by disconnecting the line from the first impinger, opening the sampling valve, and allowing process gas to flow through the line for one to two minutes. Then, close the sampling valve, and reconnect the line to the impinger train. Open the petcock on the dry gas meter outlet. Record the initial DGM reading.</P>
            <P>8.4 Open the sampling valve, and then adjust the valve to obtain a rate of approximately 1 liter/min (0.035 cfm). Maintain a constant (±10 percent) flow rate during the test. Record the DGM temperature.</P>
            <P>8.5 Sample for at least 10 minutes. At the end of the sampling time, close the sampling valve, and record the final volume and temperature readings. Conduct a leak-check as described in Section 8.2. A yellow color in the final cadmium sulfate impinger indicates depletion of the absorbing solution. An additional cadmium sulfate impinger should be added for subsequent samples and the sample with yellow color in the final impinger should be voided.</P>

            <P>8.6 Disconnect the impinger train from the sampling line. Connect the charcoal tube and the pump as shown in Figure 11-1. Purge the train [at a rate of 1 liter/min (0.035 ft<SU>3</SU>/min)] with clean ambient air for 15 minutes to ensure that all H<E T="52">2</E>S is removed from the H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>. For sample recovery, cap the open ends, and remove the impinger train to a clean area that is away from sources of heat. The area should be well lighted, but not exposed to direct sunlight.</P>
            <P>8.7 Sample Recovery.</P>
            <P>8.7.1 Discard the contents of the H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> impinger. Carefully rinse with water the contents of the third, fourth, and fifth impingers into a 500-ml iodine flask.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The impingers normally have only a thin film of CdS remaining after a water rinse. If Antifoam B was not used or if significant quantities of yellow CdS remain in the impingers, the alternative recovery procedure in section 11.2 must be used.</P>

            <P>10.1 Calibration. Calibrate the sample collection equipment as follows.</P>
            <P>10.1.1 Dry Gas Meter.</P>

            <P>10.1.1.1 Initial Calibration. The DGM shall be calibrated before its initial use in the field. Proceed as follows: First, assemble the following components in series: Drying tube, needle valve, pump, rotameter, and DGM. <PRTPAGE P="355"/>Then, leak-check the metering system as follows: Place a vacuum gauge (at least 760 mm Hg) at the inlet to the drying tube, and pull a vacuum of 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg); plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum shall remain stable for at least 30 seconds. Carefully release the vacuum gauge before releasing the flow meter end. Next, calibrate the DGM (at the sampling flow rate specified by the method) as follows: Connect an appropriately sized wet-test meter (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 1 liter per revolution) to the inlet of the drying tube. Make three independent calibration runs, using at least five revolutions of the DGM per run. Calculate the calibration factor, Y (wet-test meter calibration volume divided by the DGM volume, both volumes adjusted to the same reference temperature and pressure), for each run, and average the results. If any Y value deviates by more than 2 percent from the average, the DGM is unacceptable for use. Otherwise, use the average as the calibration factor for subsequent test runs.</P>
            <P>10.1.1.2 Post-Test Calibration Check. After each field test series, conduct a calibration check as in section 10.1.1.1, above, except for the following two variations: (a) three or more revolutions of the DGM may be used and (b) only two independent runs need be made. If the calibration factor does not deviate by more than 5 percent from the initial calibration factor (determined in section 10.1.1.1), then the DGM volumes obtained during the test series are acceptable. If the calibration factor deviates by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the DGM as in section 10.1.1.1, and for the calculations, use the calibration factor (initial or recalibration) that yields the lower gas volume for each test run.</P>
            <P>10.1.2 Temperature Sensors. Calibrate against mercury-in-glass thermometers. An alternative mercury-free thermometer may be used if the thermometer is at a minimum equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.</P>
            <P>10.1.3 Rate Meter. The rate meter need not be calibrated, but should be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.</P>

            <P>11.1 Pipette exactly 50 ml of 0.01 N I<E T="52">2</E> solution into a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 10 ml of 3 M HCl to the solution. Quantitatively rinse the acidified I<E T="52">2</E> into the iodine flask. Stopper the flask immediately, and shake briefly.<PRTPAGE P="356"/>
            </P>

            <P>11.2 Use these alternative procedures if Antifoam B was not used or if significant quantities of yellow CdS remain in the impingers. Extract the remaining CdS from the third, fourth, and fifth impingers using the acidified I<E T="52">2</E> solution. Immediately after pouring the acidified I<E T="52">2</E> into an impinger, stopper it and shake for a few moments, then transfer the liquid to the iodine flask. Do not transfer any rinse portion from one impinger to another; transfer it directly to the iodine flask. Once the acidified I<E T="52">2</E> solution has been poured into any glassware containing CdS, the container must be tightly stoppered at all times except when adding more solution, and this must be done as quickly and carefully as possible. After adding any acidified I<E T="52">2</E> solution to the iodine flask, allow a few minutes for absorption of the H<E T="52">2</E>S before adding any further rinses. Repeat the I<E T="52">2</E> extraction until all CdS is removed from the impingers. Extract that part of the connecting glassware that contains visible CdS. Quantitatively rinse all the I<E T="52">2</E> from the impingers, connectors, and the beaker into the iodine flask using water. Stopper the flask and shake briefly.</P>

            <P>11.3 Allow the iodine flask to stand about 30 minutes in the dark for absorption of the H<E T="52">2</E>S into the I<E T="52">2</E>, then complete the titration analysis as outlined in sections 11.5 and 11.6.

            <P>8.7.1 Container No. 2 (Probe).</P>

            <P>8.7.1.1 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover sample matter and any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, and front half of the filter holder by washing these components with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> and placing the wash into a glass sample storage container. Measure and record (to the nearest 2 ml) the total amount of 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> used for these rinses. Perform the 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> rinses as follows:</P>

            <P>8.7.1.2 Carefully remove the probe nozzle, and rinse the inside surfaces with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> from a wash bottle while brushing with a stainless steel, Nylon-bristle brush. Brush until the 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> rinse shows no visible particles, then make a final rinse of the inside surface with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>.</P>
            <P>8.7.1.3 Brush and rinse with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> the inside parts of the Swagelok fitting in a similar way until no visible particles remain.</P>
            <P>8.7.1.4 Rinse the probe liner with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>. While rotating the probe so that all inside surfaces will be rinsed with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>, tilt the probe, and squirt 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="361"/>into its upper end. Let the 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> drain from the lower end into the sample container. A glass funnel may be used to aid in transferring liquid washes to the container. Follow the rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, squirt 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> into the upper end of the probe as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe; hold the sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> and sample matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or more until no visible sample matter is carried out with the 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> and none remains on the probe liner on visual inspection. With stainless steel or other metal probes, run the brush through in the above prescribed manner at least six times, since metal probes have small crevices in which sample matter can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final rinse of the probe as described above.</P>
            <P>8.7.1.5 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to minimize loss of sample. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination.</P>

            <P>8.7.1.6 After ensuring that all joints are wiped clean of silicone grease, brush and rinse with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> the inside of the from half of the filter holder. Brush and rinse each surface three times or more, if needed, to remove visible sample matter. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. After all 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> washings and sample matter are collected in the sample container, tighten the lid on the sample container so that the fluid will not leak out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the container to identify its contents clearly.</P>
            <P>8.7.2 Container No. 3 (Silica Gel). Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine if it has been completely spent, and make a notation of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth impinger to the original container, and seal. A funnel may be used to pour the silica gel from the impinger and a rubber policeman may be used to remove the silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of particles that may adhere to the walls and are difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use any water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available in the field, follow the procedure for Container No. 3 in section 11.4.2.</P>
            <P>8.7.3 Container No. 4 (Impingers). Due to the large quantity of liquid involved, the impinger solutions may be placed in several containers. Clean each of the first three impingers and connecting glassware in the following manner:</P>
            <P>8.7.3.1. Wipe the impinger ball joints free of silicone grease, and cap the joints.</P>
            <P>8.7.3.2. Rotate and agitate each impinger, so that the impinger contents might serve as a rinse solution.</P>
            <P>8.7.3.3. Transfer the contents of the impingers to a 500-ml graduated cylinder. Remove the outlet ball joint cap, and drain the contents through this opening. Do not separate the impinger parts (inner and outer tubes) while transferring their contents to the cylinder. Measure the liquid volume to within 2 ml. Alternatively, determine the weight of the liquid to within 0.5 g. Record in the log the volume or weight of the liquid present, along with a notation of any color or film observed in the impinger catch. The liquid volume or weight is needed, along with the silica gel data, to calculate the stack gas moisture content (see Method 5, Figure 5-6).</P>
            <P>8.7.3.4. Transfer the contents to Container No. 4.
            </P>

              <P>In sections 8.7.3.5 and 8.7.3.6, measure and record the total amount of 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> used for rinsing.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.7.3.5. Pour approximately 30 ml of 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> into each of the first three impingers and agitate the impingers. Drain the 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> through the outlet arm of each impinger into Container No. 4. Repeat this operation a second time; inspect the impingers for any abnormal conditions.</P>

            <P>8.7.3.6. Wipe the ball joints of the glassware connecting the impingers free of silicone grease and rinse each piece of glassware twice with 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>; transfer this rinse into Container No. 4. Do not rinse or brush the glass-fritted filter support. Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the container to identify its contents clearly.</P>
            <P>8.8 Blanks.</P>
            <P>8.8.1 Nitric Acid. Save 200 ml of the 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> used for sampling and cleanup as a blank. Take the solution directly from the bottle being used and place into a glass sample container labeled “0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> blank.”</P>
            <P>8.8.2 Filter. Save two filters from each lot of filters used in sampling. Place these filters in a container labeled “filter blank.”</P>

            </NOTE>
            
            <P>11.2.2 Containers No. 2 and No. 4 (Probe and Impingers). Combine the contents of Containers No. 2 and No. 4, and evaporate to dryness on a hot plate.</P>
            <P>11.2.3 Sample Extraction for Lead.</P>

            <P>11.2.3.1 Based on the approximate stack gas particulate concentration and the total volume of stack gas sampled, estimate the total weight of particulate sample collected. Next, transfer the residue from Containers No. 2 and No. 4 to the 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask that contains the sampling filter using a rubber policeman and 10 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E> for every 100 mg of sample collected in the train or a minimum of 30 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, whichever is larger.</P>

            <P>11.2.3.2 Place the Erlenmeyer flask on a hot plate, and heat with periodic stirring for 30 minutes at a temperature just below boiling. If the sample volume falls below 15 ml, add more 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>. Add 10 ml of 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>, and continue heating for 10 minutes. Add 50 ml of hot (80 °C, 176 °F) water, and heat for 20 minutes. Remove the flask from the hot plate, and allow to cool. Filter the sample through a Millipore membrane filter, or equivalent, and transfer the filtrate to a 250-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with water.</P>

            <P>11.2.4 Filter Blank. Cut each filter into strips, and place each filter in a separate 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask.

Dilute to a total volume of 100 ml using water.</P>
            <P>11.3 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current; and adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.</P>
            <P>11.4 Analysis.</P>

            <P>11.4.1 Lead Determination. Calibrate the spectrophotometer as outlined in section 10.2, and determine the absorbance for each source sample, the filter blank, and 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E> blank. Analyze each sample three times in this manner. Make appropriate dilutions, as needed, to bring all sample Pb concentrations into the linear absorbance range of the spectrophotometer. Because instruments vary between manufacturers, no detailed operating instructions will be given here. Instead, the instructions provided with the particular instrument should be followed. If the Pb concentration of a sample is at the low end of the calibration curve and <PRTPAGE P="363"/>high accuracy is required, the sample can be taken to dryness on a hot plate and the residue dissolved in the appropriate volume of water to bring it into the optimum range of the calibration curve.</P>
            <P>11.4.2 Container No. 3 (Silica Gel). This step may be conducted in the field. Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g; record this weight.</P>
            <P>11.5 Check for Matrix Effects. Use the Method of Standard Additions as follows to check at least one sample from each source for matrix effects on the Pb results:</P>
            <P>11.5.1 Add or spike an equal volume of standard solution to an aliquot of the sample solution.</P>
            <P>11.5.2 Measure the absorbance of the resulting solution and the absorbance of an aliquot of unspiked sample.</P>
            <P>11.5.3 Calculate the Pb concentration C<E T="52">m</E> in µg/ml of the sample solution using Equation 12-1 in section 12.5.</P>

            <P>Volume corrections will not be required if the solutions as analyzed have been made to the same final volume. Therefore, C<E T="52">m</E> and C<E T="52">a</E> represent Pb concentration before dilutions.</P>
            <P>Method of Standard Additions procedures described on pages 9-4 and 9-5 of the section entitled “General Information” of the Perkin Elmer Corporation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry Manual, Number 303-0152 (Reference 1 in section 17.0) may also be used. In any event, if the results of the Method of Standard Additions procedure used on the single source sample do not agree to within ±5 percent of the value obtained by the routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from the source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.</P>

For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Method 5, Figure 5-3.</P>
            <P>8.6 Sample Recovery. Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the probe to cool.</P>
            <P>8.6.1 When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle, and place a cap over it to keep from losing part of the sample. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling down as this would create a vacuum in the filter holder, thus drawing water from the impingers into the filter holder.</P>
            <P>8.6.2 Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sample train, wipe off any silicone grease, and cap the open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Remove the filter assembly, wipe off any silicone grease from the filter holder inlet, and cap this inlet. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger, and cap the impinger. After wiping off any silicone grease, cap off the filter holder outlet and any open impinger inlets and outlets. Ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps may be used to close these openings.</P>
            <P>8.6.3 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so that the chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be minimized.</P>
            <P>8.6.4 Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly, and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows:</P>
            <P>8.6.4.1 Container No. 1 (Probe, Filter, and Impinger Catches).</P>
            <P>8.6.4.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure to the nearest ml, and record the volume of the water in the first three impingers; include any condensate in the probe in this determination. Transfer the impinger water from the graduated cylinder into a polyethylene container. Add the filter to this container. (The filter may be handled separately using procedures subject to the Administrator's approval.) Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, clean all sample-exposed surfaces (including the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, first three impingers, impinger connectors, and filter holder) with water. Use less than 500 ml for the entire wash. Add the washings to the sample container. Perform the water rinses as follows:</P>
            <P>8.6.4.1.2 Carefully remove the probe nozzle and rinse the inside surface with water from a wash bottle. Brush with a Nylon bristle brush, and rinse until the rinse shows no visible particles, after which make a final rinse of the inside surface. Brush and rinse the inside parts of the Swagelok fitting with water in a similar way.</P>

            <P>8.6.4.1.3 Rinse the probe liner with water. While squirting the water into the upper end of the probe, tilt and rotate the probe so that all inside surfaces will be wetted with water. Let the water drain from the lower end into the sample container. A funnel (glass or polyethylene) may be used to aid in transferring the liquid washes to the container. Follow the rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, and squirt water into <PRTPAGE P="369"/>the upper end as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe. Hold the sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any water and particulate matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or more. With stainless steel or other metal probes, run the brush through in the above prescribed manner at least six times since metal probes have small crevices in which particulate matter can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with water, and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final rinse of the probe as described above.</P>
            <P>8.6.4.1.4 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination.</P>
            <P>8.6.4.1.5 Rinse the inside surface of each of the first three impingers (and connecting glassware) three separate times. Use a small portion of water for each rinse, and brush each sample-exposed surface with a Nylon bristle brush, to ensure recovery of fine particulate matter. Make a final rinse of each surface and of the brush.</P>
            <P>8.6.4.1.6 After ensuring that all joints have been wiped clean of the silicone grease, brush and rinse with water the inside of the filter holder (front-half only, if filter is positioned between the third and fourth impingers). Brush and rinse each surface three times or more if needed. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder.</P>
            <P>8.6.4.1.7 After all water washings and particulate matter have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid so that water will not leak out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to transport. Label the container clearly to identify its contents.</P>
            <P>8.6.4.2 Container No. 2 (Sample Blank). Prepare a blank by placing an unused filter in a polyethylene container and adding a volume of water equal to the total volume in Container No. 1. Process the blank in the same manner as for Container No. 1.</P>
            <P>8.6.4.3 Container No. 3 (Silica Gel). Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent, and make a notation of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth impinger to its original container, and seal. A funnel may be used to pour the silica gel and a rubber policeman to remove the silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of dust particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use any water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available in the field, follow the analytical procedure for Container No. 3 in section 11.4.2.</P>

            <P>10.2.2 Accurately prepare a series of standards from the 0.01 mg F<E T="51">−</E>/ml standard fluoride solution (Section 7.3.10) by diluting 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 ml to 100 ml with deionized, distilled water. Pipet 50 ml from each solution, and transfer each to a separate 100-ml beaker. Then add 10 ml of SPADNS mixed reagent (Section 7.3.13) to each. These standards will contain 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 µg F<E T="51">−</E>(0 to 1.4 µg/ml), respectively.</P>
            <P>10.2.3 After mixing, place the blank and calibration standards in a constant temperature bath for 30 minutes before reading the absorbance with the spectrophotometer. Adjust all samples to this same temperature before analyzing.</P>
            <P>10.2.4 With the spectrophotometer at 570 nm, use the blank standard to set the absorbance to zero. Determine the absorbance of the standards.</P>
            <P>10.2.5 Prepare a calibration curve by plotting µg F<E T="51">−</E>/50 ml versus absorbance on linear graph paper. Prepare the standard curve initially and thereafter whenever the SPADNS mixed reagent is newly made. Also, run a <PRTPAGE P="370"/>calibration standard with each set of samples and, if it differs from the calibration curve by more than ±2 percent, prepare a new standard curve.</P>

            <P>11.1 Sample Loss Check. Note the liquid levels in Containers No. 1 and No. 2, determine whether leakage occurred during transport, and note this finding on the analytical data sheet. If noticeable leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results.</P>
            <P>11.2 Sample Preparation. Treat the contents of each sample container as described below:</P>
            <P>11.2.1 Container No. 1 (Probe, Filter, and Impinger Catches). Filter this container's contents, including the sampling filter, through Whatman No. 541 filter paper, or equivalent, into a 1500-ml beaker.</P>
            <P>11.2.1.1 If the filtrate volume exceeds 900 ml, make the filtrate basic (red to phenolphthalein) with NaOH, and evaporate to less than 900 ml.</P>
            <P>11.2.1.2 Place the filtered material (including sampling filter) in a nickel crucible, add a few ml of water, and macerate the filters with a glass rod.</P>

            <P>11.2.1.2.1 Add 100 mg CaO to the crucible, and mix the contents thoroughly to form a slurry. Add two drops of phenolphthalein indicator. Place the crucible in a hood under infrared lamps or on a hot plate at low heat. Evaporate the water completely. During the evaporation of the water, keep the slurry basic (red to phenolphthalein) to avoid loss of F<E T="51">−</E>. If the indicator turns colorless (acidic) during the evaporation, add CaO until the color turns red again.</P>
            <P>11.2.1.2.2 After evaporation of the water, place the crucible on a hot plate under a hood, and slowly increase the temperature until the Whatman No. 541 and sampling filters char. It may take several hours to char the filters completely.</P>
            <P>11.2.1.2.3 Place the crucible in a cold muffle furnace. Gradually (to prevent smoking) increase the temperature to 600 °C (1100 °F), and maintain this temperature until the contents are reduced to an ash. Remove the crucible from the furnace, and allow to cool.</P>
            <P>11.2.1.2.4 Add approximately 4 g of crushed NaOH to the crucible, and mix. Return the crucible to the muffle furnace, and fuse the sample for 10 minutes at 600 °C.</P>

            <P>11.2.1.2.5 Remove the sample from the furnace, and cool to ambient temperature. Using several rinsings of warm water, transfer the contents of the crucible to the beaker containing the filtrate. To ensure complete sample removal, rinse finally with two 20-ml portions of 25 percent H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>, and carefully add to the beaker. Mix well, and transfer to a 1-liter volumetric flask. Dilute to volume with water, and mix thoroughly. Allow any undissolved solids to settle.</P>
            <P>11.2.2 Container No. 2 (Sample Blank). Treat in the same manner as described in section 11.2.1 above.</P>

            <P>11.2.3 Adjustment of Acid/Water Ratio in Distillation Flask. Place 400 ml of water in the distillation flask, and add 200 ml of concentrated H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>. Add some soft glass beads and several small pieces of broken glass tubing, and assemble the apparatus as shown in Figure 13A-2. Heat the flask until it reaches a temperature of 175 °C (347 °F) to adjust the acid/water ratio for subsequent distillations. Discard the distillate.
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="04">Caution:</E> Use a protective shield when carrying out this procedure. Observe standard precautions when mixing H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> with water. Slowly add the acid to the flask with constant swirling.
            </P>
            <P>11.3 Distillation.</P>

            <P>11.3.1 Cool the contents of the distillation flask to below 80 °C (180 °F). Pipet an aliquot of sample containing less than 10.0 mg F<E T="51">−</E> directly into the distillation flask, and add water to make a total volume of 220 ml added to the distillation flask. (To estimate the appropriate aliquot size, select an aliquot of the solution, and treat as described in section 11.4.1. This will be an approximation of the F<E T="51">−</E> content because of possible interfering ions.)
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>If the sample contains chloride, add 5 mg of Ag<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> to the flask for every mg of chloride.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>11.3.2 Place a 250-ml volumetric flask at the condenser exit. Heat the flask as rapidly as possible with a Bunsen burner, and collect all the distillate up to 175 °C (347 °F). During heatup, play the burner flame up and down the side of the flask to prevent bumping. Conduct the distillation as rapidly as possible (15 minutes or less). Slow distillations have been found to produce low F<E T="51">−</E> recoveries. Be careful not to exceed 175 °C (347 °F) to avoid causing H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> to distill over. If F<E T="51">−</E> distillation in the mg range is to be followed by a distillation in the fractional mg range, add 220 ml of water and distill it over as in the acid adjustment step to remove residual F<E T="51">−</E> from the distillation system.</P>

            <P>11.3.3 The acid in the distillation flask may be used until there is carry-over of interferences or poor F<E T="51">−</E> recovery. Check for interference and for recovery efficiency every tenth distillation using a water blank and a standard solution. Change the acid whenever the F<E T="51">−</E> recovery is less than 90 percent or the blank value exceeds 0.1 µg/ml.</P>
            <P>11.4 Sample Analysis.</P>
            <P>11.4.1 Containers No. 1 and No. 2.</P>

            <P>11.4.1.1 After distilling suitable aliquots from Containers No. 1 and No. 2 according to section 11.3, dilute the distillate in the volumetric flasks to exactly 250 ml with water, and mix thoroughly. Pipet a suitable aliquot <PRTPAGE P="371"/>of each sample distillate (containing 10 to 40 µg F<E T="51">−</E>/ml) into a beaker, and dilute to 50 ml with water. Use the same aliquot size for the blank. Add 10 ml of SPADNS mixed reagent (Section 7.3.13), and mix thoroughly.</P>

            <P>11.4.1.2 After mixing, place the sample in a constant-temperature bath containing the standard solutions for 30 minutes before reading the absorbance on the spectrophotometer.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

              <P>After the sample and colorimetric reagent are mixed, the color formed is stable for approximately 2 hours. Also, a 3 °C (5.4 °F) temperature difference between the sample and standard solutions produces an error of approximately 0.005 mg F<E T="51">−</E>/liter. To avoid this error, the absorbencies of the sample and standard solutions must be measured at the same temperature.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>11.4.1.3 Set the spectrophotometer to zero absorbance at 570 nm with the zero reference solution (Section 7.3.12), and check the spectrophotometer calibration with the standard solution (Section 7.3.10).

            <P>10.2 Fluoride Electrode. Prepare fluoride standardizing solutions by serial dilution of the 0.1 M fluoride standard solution. Pipet 10 ml of 0.1 M fluoride standard solution into a 100-ml volumetric flask, and make up to the mark with water for a 10<E T="51">−2</E> M standard solution. Use 10 ml of 10<E T="51">−2</E> M solution to make a 10<E T="51">−3</E> M solution in the same manner.

            <P>10.2.1 Pipet 50 ml of each standard into a separate beaker. Add 50 ml of TISAB to each beaker. Place the electrode in the most dilute standard solution. When a steady millivolt reading is obtained, plot the value on the linear axis of semilog graph paper versus concentration on the log axis. Plot the nominal value for concentration of the standard on the log axis, (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> when 50 ml of 10<E T="51">−2</E> M standard is diluted with 50 ml of TISAB, the concentration is still designated “10<E T="51">−2</E> M”).</P>

            <P>10.2.2 Between measurements, soak the fluoride sensing electrode in water for 30 seconds, and then remove and blot dry. Analyze the standards going from dilute to concentrated standards. A straight-line calibration curve will be obtained, with nominal concentrations of 10<E T="51">−4</E>, 10<E T="51">−3</E>, 10<E T="51">−2</E>, 10<E T="51">−1</E> fluoride molarity on the log axis plotted versus electrode potential (in mv) on the linear scale. Some electrodes may be slightly nonlinear between 10<E T="51">−5</E> and 10<E T="51">−4</E> M. If this occurs, use additional standards between these two concentrations.</P>

            <P>10.2.3 Calibrate the fluoride electrode daily, and check it hourly. Prepare fresh fluoride standardizing solutions daily (10<E T="51">−2</E> M or less). Store fluoride standardizing solutions in polyethylene or polypropylene containers.

Add an equal volume of TISAB, and mix. The sample should be at the same temperature as the calibration standards when measurements are made. If ambient laboratory temperature fluctuates more than ±2 °C from the temperature at which the calibration standards were measured, condition samples and standards in a constant-temperature bath before measurement. Stir the sample with a magnetic stirrer during measurement to minimize electrode response time. If the stirrer generates enough heat to change solution temperature, place a piece of temperature insulating material, such as cork, between the stirrer and the beaker.

            <P>2.1 Gaseous and particulate fluoride roof monitor emissions are drawn into a permanent sampling manifold through several large nozzles. The sample is transported from the sampling manifold to ground level through a duct. The fluoride content of the gas in the duct is determined using either Method 13A or Method 13B. Effluent velocity and volumetric flow rate are determined using anemometers located in the roof monitor.</P>

            <P>6.1 Velocity Measurement Apparatus.</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Anemometer Specifications. Propeller anemometers, or equivalent. Each anemometer shall meet the following specifications:</P>
            <P>6.1.1.1 Its propeller shall be made of polystyrene, or similar material of uniform density. To ensure uniformity of performance among propellers, it is desirable that all propellers be made from the same mold.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.2 The propeller shall be properly balanced, to optimize performance.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.3 When the anemometer is mounted horizontally, its threshold velocity shall not exceed 15 m/min (50 ft/min).</P>
            <P>6.1.1.4 The measurement range of the anemometer shall extend to at least 600 m/min (2,000 ft/min).</P>
            <P>6.1.1.5 The anemometer shall be able to withstand prolonged exposure to dusty and corrosive environments; one way of achieving this is to purge the bearings of the anemometer continuously with filtered air during operation.</P>
            <P>6.1.1.6 All anemometer components shall be properly shielded or encased, such that the performance of the anemometer is uninfluenced by potroom magnetic field effects.</P>

            <P>6.1.1.7 A known relationship shall exist between the electrical output signal from the anemometer generator and the propeller shaft rpm (see section 10.2.1). Anemometers having other types of output signals (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> optical) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. If other types of anemometers are used, there must be a known relationship between output signal and shaft rpm (see section 10.2.2).</P>
            <P>6.1.1.8 Each anemometer shall be equipped with a suitable readout system (see section 6.1.3).</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Anemometer Installation Requirements.</P>
            <P>6.1.2.1 Single, Isolated Potroom. If the affected facility consists of a single, isolated potroom (or potroom segment), install at least one anemometer for every 85 m (280 ft) of roof monitor length. If the length of the roof monitor divided by 85 m (280 ft) is not a whole number, round the fraction to the nearest whole number to determine the number of anemometers needed. For monitors that are less than 130 m (430 ft) in length, use at least two anemometers. Divide the monitor cross-section into as many equal areas as anemometers, and locate an anemometer at the centroid of each equal area. See exception in section 6.1.2.3.</P>
            <P>6.1.2.2 Two or More Potrooms. If the affected facility consists of two or more potrooms (or potroom segments) ducted to a common control device, install anemometers in each potroom (or segment) that contains a sampling manifold. Install at least one anemometer for every 85 m (280 ft) of roof monitor length of the potroom (or segment). If the potroom (or segment) length divided by 85 m (280 ft) is not a whole number, round the fraction to the nearest whole number to determine the number of anemometers needed. If the potroom (or segment) length is less than 130 m (430 ft), use at least two anemometers. Divide the potroom (or segment) monitor cross-section into as many equal areas as anemometers, and locate an anemometer at the centroid of each equal area. See exception in section 6.1.2.3.</P>

            <P>6.1.2.3 Placement of Anemometer at the Center of Manifold. At least one anemometer shall be installed in the immediate vicinity (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> within 10 m (33 ft)) of the center of the manifold (see section 6.2.1). For its placement in relation to the width of the monitor, there are two alternatives. The first is to make a velocity traverse of the width of the roof monitor where an anemometer is to be placed and install the anemometer at a point of average velocity along this traverse. The traverse may be made with any suitable low velocity measuring device, and shall be made during normal process operating conditions. The second alternative is to install the anemometer half-way across the width of the roof monitor. In this latter case, the velocity traverse need not be conducted.</P>

            <P>6.1.3 Recorders. Recorders that are equipped with suitable auxiliary equipment (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> transducers) for converting the output signal from each anemometer to a continuous recording of air flow velocity or to an integrated measure of volumetric flowrate shall be used. A suitable recorder is one that allows the output signal from the propeller anemometer to be read to within 1 percent when the velocity is between 100 and 120 m/min (330 and 390 ft/min). For the purpose of recording velocity, “continuous” shall mean one readout per 15-minute or shorter time interval. A constant amount of time shall elapse between readings. Volumetric flow rate may be determined by an electrical count of anemometer revolutions. The recorders or counters shall permit identification of the velocities or flowrates measured by each individual anemometer.</P>

            <P>6.2 Roof Monitor Air Sampling System.</P>

            <P>6.2.1 Manifold System and Ductwork. A minimum of one manifold system shall be installed for each potroom group. The manifold <PRTPAGE P="378"/>system and ductwork shall meet the following specifications:</P>
            <P>6.2.1.1 The manifold system and connecting duct shall be permanently installed to draw an air sample from the roof monitor to ground level. A typical installation of a duct for drawing a sample from a roof monitor to ground level is shown in Figure 14-1 in section 17.0. A plan of a manifold system that is located in a roof monitor is shown in Figure 14-2. These drawings represent a typical installation for a generalized roof monitor. The dimensions on these figures may be altered slightly to make the manifold system fit into a particular roof monitor, but the general configuration shall be followed.</P>
            <P>6.2.1.2 There shall be eight nozzles, each having a diameter of 0.40 to 0.50 m.</P>
            <P>6.2.1.3 The length of the manifold system from the first nozzle to the eighth shall be 35 m (115 ft) or eight percent of the length of the potroom (or potroom segment) roof monitor, whichever is greater. Deviation from this requirement is subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.2.1.4 The duct leading from the roof monitor manifold system shall be round with a diameter of 0.30 to 0.40 m (1.0 to 1.3 ft). All connections in the ductwork shall be leak-free.</P>
            <P>6.2.1.5 As shown in Figure 14-2, each of the sample legs of the manifold shall have a device, such as a blast gate or valve, to enable adjustment of the flow into each sample nozzle.</P>
            <P>6.2.1.6 The manifold system shall be located in the immediate vicinity of one of the propeller anemometers (see section 8.1.1.4) and as close as possible to the midsection of the potroom (or potroom segment). Avoid locating the manifold system near the end of a potroom or in a section where the aluminum reduction pot arrangement is not typical of the rest of the potroom (or potroom segment). The sample nozzles shall be centered in the throat of the roof monitor (see Figure 14-1).</P>
            <P>6.2.1.7 All sample-exposed surfaces within the nozzles, manifold, and sample duct shall be constructed with 316 stainless steel. Alternatively, aluminum may be used if a new ductwork is conditioned with fluoride-laden roof monitor air for a period of six weeks before initial testing. Other materials of construction may be used if it is demonstrated through comparative testing, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that there is no loss of fluorides in the system.</P>
            <P>6.2.1.8 Two sample ports shall be located in a vertical section of the duct between the roof monitor and the exhaust fan (see section 6.2.2). The sample ports shall be at least 10 duct diameters downstream and three diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend or contraction. The two sample ports shall be situated 90° apart. One of the sample ports shall be situated so that the duct can be traversed in the plane of the nearest upstream duct bend.</P>
            <P>6.2.2 Exhaust Fan. An industrial fan or blower shall be attached to the sample duct at ground level (see Figure 14-1). This exhaust fan shall have a capacity such that a large enough volume of air can be pulled through the ductwork to maintain an isokinetic sampling rate in all the sample nozzles for all flow rates normally encountered in the roof monitor. The exhaust fan volumetric flow rate shall be adjustable so that the roof monitor gases can be drawn isokinetically into the sample nozzles. This control of flow may be achieved by a damper on the inlet to the exhauster or by any other workable method.</P>
            <P>6.3 Temperature Measurement Apparatus. To monitor and record the temperature of the roof monitor effluent gas, and consisting of the following:</P>
            <P>6.3.1 Temperature Sensor. A temperature sensor shall be installed in the roof monitor near the sample duct. The temperature sensor shall conform to the specifications outlined in Method 2, section 6.3.</P>
            <P>6.3.2 Signal Transducer. Transducer, to change the temperature sensor voltage output to a temperature readout.</P>
            <P>6.3.3 Thermocouple Wire. To reach from roof monitor to signal transducer and recorder.</P>
            <P>6.3.4 Recorder. Suitable recorder to monitor the output from the thermocouple signal transducer.</P>

            <P>8.1 Roof Monitor Velocity Determination.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 Velocity Estimate(s) for Setting Isokinetic Flow. To assist in setting isokinetic flow in the manifold sample nozzles, the anticipated average velocity in the section of the roof monitor containing the sampling manifold shall be estimated before each test run. Any convenient means to make this estimate may be used (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the velocity indicated by the anemometer in the section of the roof monitor containing the sampling manifold may be continuously monitored during the 24-hour period before the test run). If there is question as to whether a single estimate of average velocity is adequate for an entire test run (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if velocities are anticipated to be significantly different during different potroom operations), the test run may be divided into two or more “sub-runs,” and a different estimated average velocity may be used for each sub-run (see section 8.4.2).</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Velocity Determination During a Test Run. During the actual test run, record the <PRTPAGE P="379"/>velocity or volumetric flowrate readings of each propeller anemometer in the roof monitor. Readings shall be taken from each anemometer at equal time intervals of 15 minutes or less (or continuously).</P>
            <P>8.2 Temperature Recording. Record the temperature of the roof monitor effluent gases at least once every 2 hours during the test run.</P>
            <P>8.3 Pretest Ductwork Conditioning. During the 24-hour period immediately preceding the test run, turn on the exhaust fan, and draw roof monitor air through the manifold system and ductwork. Adjust the fan to draw a volumetric flow through the duct such that the velocity of gas entering the manifold nozzles approximates the average velocity of the air exiting the roof monitor in the vicinity of the sampling manifold.</P>
            <P>8.4 Manifold Isokinetic Sample Rate Adjustment(s).</P>
            <P>8.4.1 Initial Adjustment. Before the test run (or first sub-run, if applicable; see sections 8.1.1 and 8.4.2), adjust the fan such that air enters the manifold sample nozzles at a velocity equal to the appropriate estimated average velocity determined under section 8.1.1. Use Equation 14-1 (Section 12.2.2) to determine the correct stream velocity needed in the duct at the sampling location, in order for sample gas to be drawn isokinetically into the manifold nozzles. Next, verify that the correct stream velocity has been achieved, by performing a pitot tube traverse of the sample duct (using either a standard or Type S pitot tube); use the procedure outlined in Method 2.</P>

            <P>8.4.2 Adjustments During Run. If the test run is divided into two or more “sub-runs” (see section 8.1.1), additional isokinetic rate adjustment(s) may become necessary during the run. Any such adjustment shall be made just before the start of a sub-run, using the procedure outlined in section 8.4.1 above.

            <P>8.5 Pretest Preparation, Preliminary Determinations, Preparation of Sampling Train, Leak-Check Procedures, Sampling Train Operation, and Sample Recovery. Same as Method 13A, sections 8.1 through 8.6, with the exception of the following:</P>
            <P>8.5.1 A single train shall be used for the entire sampling run. Alternatively, if two or more sub-runs are performed, a separate train may be used for each sub-run; note, however, that if this option is chosen, the area of the sampling nozzle shall be the same (±2 percent) for each train. If the test run is divided into sub-runs, a complete traverse of the duct shall be performed during each sub-run.</P>
            <P>8.5.2 Time Per Run. Each test run shall last 8 hours or more; if more than one run is to be performed, all runs shall be of approximately the same (±10 percent) length. If questions exist as to the representativeness of an 8-hour test, a longer period should be selected. Conduct each run during a period when all normal operations are performed underneath the sampling manifold. For most recently-constructed plants, 24 hours are required for all potroom operations and events to occur in the area beneath the sampling manifold. During the test period, all pots in the potroom group shall be operated such that emissions are representative of normal operating conditions in the potroom group.</P>

            <P>Same as section 10.0 of either Method 13A or Method 13B, as applicable, with the addition of the following:</P>
            <P>10.1 Manifold Intake Nozzles. The manifold intake nozzles shall be calibrated when the manifold system is installed or, alternatively, the manifold may be preassembled and the nozzles calibrated on the ground prior to installation. The following procedures shall be observed:</P>
            <P>10.1.1 Adjust the exhaust fan to draw a volumetric flow rate (refer to Equation 14-1) such that the entrance velocity into each manifold nozzle approximates the average effluent velocity in the roof monitor.</P>

            <P>10.1.2 Measure the velocity of the air entering each nozzle by inserting a standard pitot tube into a 2.5 cm or less diameter hole (see Figure 14-2) located in the manifold between each blast gate (or valve) and nozzle. Note that a standard pitot tube is used, rather <PRTPAGE P="380"/>than a type S, to eliminate possible velocity measurement errors due to cross-section blockage in the small (0.13 m diameter) manifold leg ducts. The pitot tube tip shall be positioned at the center of each manifold leg duct. Take care to ensure that there is no leakage around the pitot tube, which could affect the indicated velocity in the manifold leg.</P>
            <P>10.1.3 If the velocity of air being drawn into each nozzle is not the same, open or close each blast gate (or valve) until the velocity in each nozzle is the same. Fasten each blast gate (or valve) so that it will remain in position, and close the pitot port holes.</P>
            <P>10.2 Initial Calibration of Propeller Anemometers.</P>
            <P>10.2.1 Anemometers that meet the specifications outlined in section 6.1.1 need not be calibrated, provided that a reference performance curve relating anemometer signal output to air velocity (covering the velocity range of interest) is available from the manufacturer. If a reference performance curve is not available from the manufacturer, such a curve shall be generated.</P>

            <P>For the purpose of this method, a “reference” performance curve is defined as one that has been derived from primary standard calibration data, with the anemometer mounted vertically. “Primary standard” data are obtainable by: (a) direct calibration of one or more of the anemometers by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); (b) NIST-traceable calibration; or (c) Calibration by direct measurement of fundamental parameters such as length and time (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by moving the anemometers through still air at measured rates of speed, and recording the output signals).</P>

            <P>10.2.2 Anemometers having output signals other than electrical (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> optical) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. If other types of anemometers are used, a reference performance curve shall be generated, using procedures subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>10.2.3 The reference performance curve shall be derived from at least the following three points: 60 ±15, 900 ±100, and 1800 ±100 rpm.</P>
            <P>10.3 Initial Performance Checks. Conduct these checks within 60 days before the first performance test.</P>
            <P>10.3.1 Anemometers. A performance-check shall be conducted as outlined in sections 10.3.1.1 through 10.3.1.3. Alternatively, any other suitable method that takes into account the signal output, propeller condition, and threshold velocity of the anemometer may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>10.3.1.1 Check the signal output of the anemometer by using an accurate rpm generator (see Figure 14-3) or synchronous motors to spin the propeller shaft at each of the three rpm settings described in section 10.2.3, and measuring the output signal at each setting. If, at each setting, the output signal is within 5 percent of the manufacturer's value, the anemometer can be used. If the anemometer performance is unsatisfactory, the anemometer shall either be replaced or repaired.</P>
            <P>10.3.1.2 Check the propeller condition, by visually inspecting the propeller, making note of any significant damage or warpage; damaged or deformed propellers shall be replaced.</P>
            <P>10.3.1.3 Check the anemometer threshold velocity as follows: With the anemometer mounted as shown in Figure 14-4(A), fasten a known weight (a straight-pin will suffice) to the anemometer propeller at a fixed distance from the center of the propeller shaft. This will generate a known torque; for example, a 0.1-g weight, placed 10 cm from the center of the shaft, will generate a torque of 1.0 g-cm. If the known torque causes the propeller to rotate downward, approximately 90° [see Figure 14-4(B)], then the known torque is greater than or equal to the starting torque; if the propeller fails to rotate approximately 90°, the known torque is less than the starting torque. By trying different combinations of weight and distance, the starting torque of a particular anemometer can be satisfactorily estimated. Once an estimate of the starting torque has been obtained, the threshold velocity of the anemometer (for horizontal mounting) can be estimated from a graph such as Figure 14-5 (obtained from the manufacturer). If the horizontal threshold velocity is acceptable [&lt;15 m/min (50 ft/min), when this technique is used], the anemometer can be used. If the threshold velocity of an anemometer is found to be unacceptably high, the anemometer shall either be replaced or repaired.</P>
            <P>10.3.2 Recorders and Counters. Check the calibration of each recorder and counter (see section 6.1.2) at a minimum of three points, approximately spanning the expected range of velocities. Use the calibration procedures recommended by the manufacturer, or other suitable procedures (subject to the approval of the Administrator). If a recorder or counter is found to be out of calibration by an average amount greater than 5 percent for the three calibration points, replace or repair the system; otherwise, the system can be used.</P>
            <P>10.3.3 Temperature Measurement Apparatus. Check the calibration of the Temperature Measurement Apparatus, using the procedures outlined in section 10.3 of Method 2, at temperatures of 0, 100, and 150 °C (32, 212, and 302 °F). If the calibration is off by more than 5 °C (9 °F) at any of the temperatures, repair or replace the apparatus; otherwise, the apparatus can be used.</P>

            <P>10.4 Periodic Performance Checks. Repeat the procedures outlined in section 10.3 no <PRTPAGE P="381"/>more than 12 months after the initial performance checks. If the above systems pass the performance checks (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> if no repair or replacement of any component is necessary), continue with the performance checks on a 12-month interval basis. However, if any of the above systems fail the performance checks, repair or replace the system(s) that failed, and conduct the periodic performance checks on a 3-month interval basis, until sufficient information (to the satisfaction of the Administrator) is obtained to establish a modified performance check schedule and calculation procedure.

            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of total fluorides (TF) emissions from sources specified in the applicable regulation. This method was developed by consensus with the Aluminum Association and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</P>
            <FP>2.0 <E T="03">Summary of Method</E>
            </FP>
            <P>2.1 Total fluorides, in the form of solid and gaseous fluorides, are withdrawn from the ascending air stream inside of an aluminum reduction potroom and, prior to exiting the potroom roof monitor, into a specific cassette arrangement. The cassettes are connected by tubing to flowmeters and a manifold system that allows for the equal distribution of volume pulled through each cassette, and finally to a dry gas meter. The cassettes have a specific internal arrangement of one unaltered cellulose filter and support pad in the first section of the cassette for solid fluoride retention and two cellulose filters with support pads that are impregnated with sodium formate for the chemical absorption of gaseous fluorides in the following two sections of the cassette. A minimum of eight cassettes shall be used for a potline and shall be strategically located at equal intervals across the potroom roof so as to encompass a minimum of 8 percent of the total length of the potroom. A greater number of cassettes may be used should the regulated facility choose to do so. The mass flow rate of pollutants is determined with anemometers and temperature sensing devices located immediately below the opening of the roof monitor and spaced evenly within the cassette group.</P>

            <FP>4.0 <E T="03">Interferences and Known Limitations</E>
            </FP>
            <P>4.1 There are two principal categories of limitations that must be addressed when using this method. The first category is sampling bias and the second is analytical bias. Biases in sampling can occur when there is an insufficient number of cassettes located along the roof monitor of a potroom or if the distribution of those cassettes is spatially unequal. Known sampling biases also can occur when there are leaks within the cassette arrangement and if anemometers and temperature devices are not providing accurate data. Applicable instruments must be properly calibrated to avoid sampling bias. Analytical biases can occur when instrumentation is not calibrated or fails calibration and the instrument is used out of proper calibration. Additionally, biases can occur in the laboratory if fusion crucibles retain residual fluorides over lengthy periods of use. This condition could result in falsely elevated fluoride values. Maintaining a clean work environment in the laboratory is crucial to producing accurate values.</P>
            <P>4.2 Biases during sampling can be avoided by properly spacing the appropriate number of cassettes along the roof monitor, conducting leak checks of the cassette arrangement, calibrating the dry gas meter every 30 days, verifying the accuracy of individual flowmeters (so that there is no more than 5 percent difference in the volume pulled between any two flowmeters), and calibrating or replacing anemometers and temperature sensing devices as necessary to maintain true data generation.</P>

            <P>4.3 Analytical biases can be avoided by calibrating instruments according to the manufacturer's specifications prior to conducting any analyses, by performing internal and external audits of up to 10 percent of all samples analyzed, and by rotating individual crucibles as the “blank” crucible to detect any potential residual fluoride carry-over to samples. Should any contamination be discovered in the blank crucible, the crucible shall be thoroughly cleaned to remove any detected residual fluorides and a “blank” analysis conducted again to evaluate the effectiveness of the cleaning. The crucible <PRTPAGE P="389"/>shall remain in service as long as no detectable residual fluorides are present.</P>
            <FP>5.0 <E T="03">Safety</E>

            <P>5.1 This method may involve the handling of hazardous materials in the analytical phase. This method does not purport to address all of the potential safety hazards associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.</P>
            <P>5.2 Corrosive reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes.

            <P>6.1 Sampling.</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Cassette arrangement. The cassette itself is a three-piece, styrene acrylonitrile cassette unit (a Gelman Sciences product), 37 millimeter (mm), with plastic connectors. In the first section (the intake section), an untreated Gelman Sciences 37 mm, 0.8 micrometer (µm) DM-800 metricel membrane filter and cellulose support pad, or equivalent, is situated. In the second and third segments of the cassette there is placed one each of Gelman Sciences 37 mm, 5 µm GLA-5000 low-ash PVC filter with a cellulose support pad or equivalent product. Each of these two filters and support pads shall have been immersed in a solution of 10 percent sodium formate (volume/volume in an ethyl alcohol solution). The impregnated pads shall be placed in the cassette segments while still wet and heated at 50 °C (122 °F) until the pad is completely dry. It is important to check for a proper fit of the filter and support pad to the cassette segment to ensure that there are no areas where gases could bypass the filter. Once all of the cassette segments have been prepared, the cassette shall be assembled and a plastic plug shall be inserted into the exhaust hole of the cassette. Prior to placing the cassette into service, the space between each segment shall be taped with an appropriately durable tape to prevent the infiltration of gases through the points of connection, and an aluminum nozzle shall be inserted into the intake hole of the cassette. The aluminum nozzle shall have a short section of tubing placed over the opening of the nozzle, with the tubing plugged to prevent dust from entering the nozzle and to prepare the nozzle for the cassette arrangement leak check. An alternate nozzle type can be used if historical results or scientific demonstration of applicability can be shown.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Anemometers and temperature sensing devices. To calculate the mass flow rate of TF from the roof monitor under standard conditions, anemometers that meet the specifications in section 2.1.1 in Method 14 of this appendix or an equivalent device yielding equivalent information shall be used. A recording mechanism capable of accurately recording the exit gas temperature at least every 2 hours shall be used.</P>

            <P>6.1.3 Barometer. To correct the volumetric flow from the potline roof monitor to standard conditions, a mercury (Hg), aneroid, or other barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm [0.1 inch (in)] Hg shall be used.

            </FP>
            <P>8.1 Preparing cassette arrangement for sampling. The cassettes are initially connected to flexible tubing. The tubing is connected to flowmeters and a manifold system. The manifold system is connected to a dry gas meter (Research Appliance Company model 201009 or equivalent). The length of tubing is managed by pneumatically or electrically operated hoists located in the roof monitor, and the travel of the tubing is controlled by encasing the tubing in aluminum conduit. The tubing is lowered for cassette insertion by operating a control box at floor level. Once the cassette has been securely inserted into the tubing and the leak check performed, the tubing and cassette are raised to the roof monitor level using the floor level control box. Arrangements similar to the one described are acceptable if the scientific sample collection principles are followed.</P>
            <P>8.2 Test run sampling period. A test run shall comprise a minimum of a 24-hour sampling event encompassing at least eight cassettes per potline (or four cassettes per potroom group). Monthly compliance shall be based on three test runs during the month. Test runs of greater than 24 hours are allowed; however, three such runs shall be conducted during the month.</P>
            <P>8.3 Leak-check procedures.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Pretest leak check. A pretest leak-check is recommended; however, it is not required. To perform a pretest leak-check after the cassettes have been inserted into the tubing, isolate the cassette to be leak-checked by turning the valves on the manifold to stop all flows to the other sampling points connected to the manifold and meter. The cassette, with the plugged tubing section securing the intake of the nozzle, is subjected to the highest vacuum expected during the run. If no leaks are detected, the tubing plug can be briefly removed as the dry gas meter is rapidly turned off.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Post-test leak check. A leak check is required at the conclusion of each test run for each cassette. The leak check shall be performed in accordance with the procedure outlined in section 8.3.1 of this method except that it shall be performed at a vacuum greater than the maximum vacuum reached during the test run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 4 percent of the average sampling rate, the results are acceptable. If the leakage rate is greater than 4 percent of the average sampling rate, either record the leakage rate and correct the sampling volume as discussed in section 12.4 of this method or void the test run if the minimum number of cassettes were used. If the number of cassettes used was greater than the minimum required, discard the leaking cassette and use the remaining cassettes for the emission determination.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 Anemometers and temperature sensing device placement. Install the recording mechanism to record the exit gas temperature. Anemometers shall be installed as required in section 6.1.2 of Method 14 of this appendix, except replace the word “manifold” with “cassette group” in section 6.1.2.3. These two different instruments shall be located near each other along the roof monitor. See conceptual configurations in Figures 14A-1, 14A-2, and 14A-3 of this method. Fewer temperature devices than anemometers may be used if at least one temperature device is located within the span of the cassette group. Other anemometer location siting scenarios may be acceptable as long as the exit velocity of the roof monitor gases is representative of the entire section of the potline being sampled.</P>
            <P>8.4 Sampling. The actual sample run shall begin with the removal of the tubing and plug from the cassette nozzle. Each cassette is then raised to the roof monitor area, the dry gas meter is turned on, and the flowmeters are set to the calibration point, which allows an equal volume of sampled gas to enter each cassette. The dry gas meter shall be set to a range suitable for the specific potroom type being sampled that will yield valid data known from previous experience or a range determined by the use of the calculation in section 12 of this method. Parameters related to the test run that shall be recorded, either during the test run or after the test run if recording devices are used, include: anemometer data, roof monitor exit gas temperature, dry gas meter temperature, dry gas meter volume, and barometric pressure. At the conclusion of the test run, the cassettes shall be lowered, the dry gas meter turned off, and the volume registered on the dry gas meter recorded. The post-test leak check procedures described in section 8.3.2 of this method shall be performed. All data relevant to the test shall be recorded on a field data sheet and maintained on file.</P>
            <P>8.5 Sample recovery.</P>

            <P>8.5.1 The cassettes shall be brought to the laboratory with the intake nozzle contents protected with the section of plugged tubing previously described. The exterior of cassettes shall carefully be wiped free of any dust or debris, making sure that any falling dust or debris does not present a potential laboratory contamination problem.<PRTPAGE P="391"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.5.2 Carefully remove all tape from the cassettes and remove the initial filter, support pad, and all loose solids from the first (intake) section of the cassette. Fold the filter and support pad several times and, along with all loose solids removed from the interior of the first section of the cassette, place them into a nickel crucible. Using water, wash the interior of the nozzle into the same nickel crucible. Add 0.1 gram (g) [±0.1 milligram (mg)] of calcium oxide and a sufficient amount of water to make a loose slurry. Mix the contents of the crucible thoroughly with a Teflon” stirring rod. After rinsing any adhering residue from the stirring rod back into the crucible, place the crucible on a hot plate or in a muffle furnace until all liquid is evaporated and allow the mixture to gradually char for 1 hour.</P>
            <P>8.5.3 Transfer the crucible to a cold muffle furnace and ash at 600 °C (1,112 °F). Remove the crucible after the ashing phase and, after the crucible cools, add 3.0 g (±0.1 g) of NaOH pellets. Place this mixture in a muffle furnace at 600 °C (1,112 °F) for 3 minutes. Remove the crucible and roll the melt so as to reach all of the ash with the molten NaOH. Let the melt cool to room temperature. Add 10 to 15 ml of water to the crucible and place it on a hot plate at a low temperature setting until the melt is soft or suspended. Transfer the contents of the crucible to a 50-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the crucible with 20 ml of 1:1 perchloric acid or 20 ml of 1:1 sulfuric acid in two (2) 10 ml portions. Pour the acid rinse slowly into the volumetric flask and swirl the flask after each addition. Cool to room temperature. The product of this procedure is particulate fluorides.</P>
            <P>8.5.4 Gaseous fluorides can be isolated for analysis by folding the gaseous fluoride filters and support pads to approximately <FR>1/4</FR> of their original size and placing them in a 50-ml plastic vial. To the vial add exactly 10 ml of water and leach the sample for a minimum of 1 hour. The leachate from this process yields the gaseous fluorides for analysis.</P>

            <P>9.1 Laboratory auditing. Laboratory audits of specific and known concentrations of fluoride shall be submitted to the laboratory with each group of samples submitted for analysis. An auditor shall prepare and present the audit samples as a “blind” evaluation of laboratory performance with each group of samples submitted to the laboratory. The audits shall be prepared to represent concentrations of fluoride that could be expected to be in the low, medium and high range of actual results. Average recoveries of all three audits must equal 90 to 110 percent for acceptable results; otherwise, the laboratory must investigate procedures and instruments for potential problems.

            <P>10.1 Equipment evaluations. To ensure the integrity of this method, periodic calibrations and equipment replacements are necessary.</P>
            <P>10.1.1 Metering system. At 30-day intervals the metering system shall be calibrated. Connect the metering system inlet to the outlet of a wet test meter that is accurate to 1 percent. Refer to Figure 5-4 of Method 5 of this appendix. The wet-test meter shall have a capacity of 30 liters/revolution [1 cubic foot (ft<SU>3</SU>)/revolution]. A spirometer of 400 liters (14 ft<SU>3</SU>) or more capacity, or equivalent, may be used for calibration; however, a wet-test meter is usually more practical. The wet-test meter shall be periodically tested with a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure the accuracy. Spirometers or wet-test meters of other sizes may be used, provided that the specified accuracies of the procedure are maintained. Run the metering system pump for about 15 min. with the orifice manometer indicating a median reading as expected in field use to allow the pump to warm up and to thoroughly wet the interior of the wet-test meter. Then, at each of a minimum of three orifice manometer settings, pass an exact quantity of gas through the wet-test meter and record the volume indicated by the dry gas meter. Also record the barometric pressure, the temperatures of the wet test meter, the inlet temperatures of the dry gas meter, and the temperatures of the outlet of the dry gas meter. Record all calibration data on a form similar to the one shown in Figure 5-5 of Method 5 of this appendix and calculate Y, the dry gas meter calibration factor, and ΔH@, the orifice calibration factor at each orifice setting. Allowable tolerances for Y and ΔH@ are given in Figure 5-6 of Method 5 of this appendix. Allowable tolerances for Y and ΔH@ are given in Figure 5-5 of Method 5 of this appendix.</P>

            <P>10.1.2 Estimating volumes for initial test runs. For a facility's initial test runs, the regulated facility must have a target or desired volume of gases to be sampled and a target range of volumes to use during the calibration of the dry gas meter. Use Equations 14A-1 and 14A-2 in section 12 of this method to derive the target dry gas meter volume (F<E T="52">v</E>) for these purposes.</P>

            <P>10.1.3 Calibration of anemometers and temperature sensing devices. If the standard anemometers in Method 14 of this appendix are used, the calibration and integrity evaluations in sections 10.3.1.1 through 10.3.1.3 of Method 14 of this appendix shall be used as well as the recording device described in section 2.1.3 of Method 14. The calibrations or complete change-outs of anemometers shall take place at a minimum of once per year. <PRTPAGE P="392"/>The temperature sensing and recording devices shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications.</P>
            <P>10.1.4 Calibration of flowmeters. The calibration of flowmeters is necessary to ensure that an equal volume of sampled gas is entering each of the individual cassettes and that no large differences, which could possibly bias the sample, exist between the cassettes.</P>
            <P>10.1.4.1 Variable area, 65 mm flowmeters or equivalent shall be used. These flowmeters can be mounted on a common base for convenience. These flowmeters shall be calibrated by attaching a prepared cassette, complete with filters and pads, to the flowmeter and then to the system manifold. This manifold is an aluminum cylinder with valved inlets for connections to the flowmeters/cassettes and one outlet to a dry gas meter. The connection is then made to the wet-test meter and finally to a dry gas meter. All connections are made with tubing.</P>
            <P>10.1.4.2 Turn the dry gas meter on for 15 min. in preparation for the calibration. Turn the dry gas meter off and plug the intake hole of the cassette. Turn the dry gas meter back on to evaluate the entire system for leaks. If the dry gas meter shows a leakage rate of less than 0.02 ft<SU>3</SU>/min at 10 in. of Hg vacuum as noted on the dry gas meter, the system is acceptable to further calibration.</P>
            <P>10.1.4.3 With the dry gas meter turned on and the flow indicator ball at a selected flow rate, record the exact amount of gas pulled through the flowmeter by taking measurements from the wet test meter after exactly 10 min. Record the room temperature and barometric pressure. Conduct this test for all flowmeters in the system with all flowmeters set at the same indicator ball reading. When all flowmeters have gone through the procedure above, correct the volume pulled through each flowmeter to standard conditions. The acceptable difference between the highest and lowest flowmeter rate is 5 percent. Should one or more flowmeters be outside of the acceptable limit of 5 percent, repeat the calibration procedure at a lower or higher indicator ball reading until all flowmeters show no more than 5 percent difference among them.</P>
            <P>10.1.4.4 This flowmeter calibration shall be conducted at least once per year.</P>
            <P>10.1.5 Miscellaneous equipment calibrations. Miscellaneous equipment used such as an automatic recorder/ printer used to measure dry gas meter temperatures shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications in order to maintain the accuracy of the equipment.</P>
            <FP>11.0 Analytical Procedure</FP>
            <P>11.1 The preferred primary analytical determination of the individual isolated samples or the combined particulate and gaseous samples shall be performed by an automated methodology. The analytical method for this technology shall be based on the manufacturer's instructions for equipment operation and shall also include the analysis of five standards with concentrations in the expected range of the actual samples. The results of the analysis of the five standards shall have a coefficient of correlation of at least 0.99. A check standard shall be analyzed as the last sample of the group to determine if instrument drift has occurred. The acceptable result for the check standard is 95 to 105 percent of the standard's true value.</P>
            <P>11.2 The secondary analytical method shall be by specific ion electrode if the samples are distilled or if a TISAB IV buffer is used to eliminate aluminum interferences. Five standards with concentrations in the expected range of the actual samples shall be analyzed, and a coefficient of correlation of at least 0.99 is the minimum acceptable limit for linearity. An exception for this limit for linearity is a condition when low-level standards in the range of 0.01 to 0.48 µg fluoride/ml are analyzed. In this situation, a minimum coefficient of correlation of 0.97 is required. TISAB II shall be used for low-level analyses.</P>

            <P>1.2.1 This method applies to the determination of emissions of reduced sulfur compounds from tail gas control units of sulfur recovery plants, H<E T="52">2</E>S in fuel gas for fuel gas combustion devices, and where specified in other applicable subparts of the regulations.</P>
            <P>1.2.2 The method described below uses the principle of gas chromatographic (GC) separation and flame photometric detection (FPD). Since there are many systems or sets of operating conditions that represent useable methods for determining sulfur emissions, all systems which employ this principle, but differ only in details of equipment and operation, may be used as alternative methods, provided that the calibration precision and sample-line loss criteria are met.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 A gas sample is extracted from the emission source and diluted with clean dry air (if necessary). An aliquot of the diluted sample is then analyzed for CS<E T="52">2</E>, COS, and H<E T="52">2</E>S by GC/FPD.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>

            <P>4.1 Moisture Condensation. Moisture condensation in the sample delivery system, the analytical column, or the FPD burner block can cause losses or interferences. This potential is eliminated by heating the probe, filter box, and connections, and by maintaining the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber in an ice water bath. Moisture is removed in the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber and heating the sample beyond this point is not necessary provided the ambient temperature is above 0 °C (32 °F). Alternatively, moisture may be eliminated by heating the sample line, and by conditioning the sample with dry dilution air to lower its dew point below the operating temperature of the GC/FPD analytical system prior to analysis.</P>
            <P>4.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>). CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> have substantial desensitizing effects on the FPD even after 9:1 dilution. (Acceptable systems must demonstrate that they have eliminated this interference by some procedure such as eluting CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> before any of the sulfur compounds to be measured.) Compliance with this requirement can be demonstrated by submitting chromatograms of calibration gases with and without CO<E T="52">2</E> in the diluent gas. The CO<E T="52">2</E> level should be approximately 10 percent for the case with CO<E T="52">2</E> present. The two chromatograms should show agreement within the precision limits of section 13.3.</P>
            <P>4.3 Elemental Sulfur. The condensation of sulfur vapor in the sampling system can lead to blockage of the particulate filter. This problem can be minimized by observing the filter for buildup and changing as needed.</P>
            <P>4.4 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>). SO<E T="52">2</E> is not a specific interferent but may be present in such large amounts that it cannot be effectively separated from the other compounds of interest. The SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber described in section 6.1.3 will effectively remove SO<E T="52">2</E> from the sample.</P>

            <P>4.5 Alkali Mist. Alkali mist in the emissions of some control devices may cause a rapid increase in the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber pH, resulting in low sample recoveries. Replacing the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber contents after each run will minimize the chances of interference in these cases.</P>

            <P>6.1.1 Probe. The probe shall be made of Teflon or Teflon-lined stainless steel and heated to prevent moisture condensation. It shall be designed to allow calibration gas to enter the probe at or near the sample point entry. Any portion of the probe that contacts the stack gas must be heated to prevent moisture condensation. The probe described in section 6.1.1 of Method 16A having a nozzle directed away from the gas stream is recommended for sources having particulate or mist emissions. Where very high stack temperatures prohibit the use of Teflon probe components, glass or quartz-lined probes may serve as substitutes.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Particulate Filter. 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-micron porosity Teflon filter (available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343). The filter holder must be maintained in a hot box at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F).</P>
            <P>6.1.3 SO<E T="52">2</E> Scrubber. Three 300-ml Teflon segment impingers connected in series with flexible, thick-walled, Teflon tubing. (Impinger parts and tubing available through Savillex.) The first two impingers contain 100 ml of citrate buffer, and the third impinger is initially dry. The tip of the tube inserted into the solution should be constricted to less than 3-mm (<FR>1/8</FR>-in.) ID and should be immersed to a depth of at least 50 cm (2 in.). Immerse the impingers in an ice water bath and maintain near 0 °C. The scrubber solution will normally last for a 3-hour run before needing replacement. This will depend upon the effects of moisture and particulate matter on the solution strength and pH. Connections between the probe, particulate filter, and SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber shall be made of Teflon and as short in length as possible. All portions of the probe, particulate filter, and connections prior to the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber (or alternative point of moisture removal) shall be maintained at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F).</P>
            <P>6.1.4 Sample Line. Teflon, no greater than 13-mm (<FR>1/2</FR>-in.) ID. Alternative materials, such as virgin Nylon, may be used provided the line-loss test is acceptable.</P>
            <P>6.1.5 Sample Pump. The sample pump shall be a leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm type or equivalent.</P>
            <P>6.2 Analysis. The following items are needed for sample analysis:</P>
            <P>6.2.1 Dilution System. The dilution system must be constructed such that all sample contacts are made of Teflon, glass, or stainless steel. It must be capable of approximately a 9:1 dilution of the sample.</P>
            <P>6.2.2 Gas Chromatograph (see Figure 15-2). The gas chromatograph must have at least the following components:</P>
            <P>6.2.2.1 Oven. Capable of maintaining the separation column at the proper operating temperature ±1 °C.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.2 Temperature Gauge. To monitor column oven, detector, and exhaust temperature ±1 °C.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.3 Flow System. Gas metering system to measure sample, fuel, combustion gas, and carrier gas flows.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.4 Flame Photometric Detector.</P>

            <P>6.2.2.4.1 Electrometer. Capable of full scale amplification of linear ranges of 10<E T="51">−9</E> to 10<E T="51">−4</E> amperes full scale.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.4.2 Power Supply. Capable of delivering up to 750 volts.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.5 Recorder. Compatible with the output voltage range of the electrometer.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.6 Rotary Gas Valves. Multiport Teflon-lined valves equipped with sample loop. Sample loop volumes shall be chosen to provide the needed analytical range. Teflon tubing and fittings shall be used throughout to present an inert surface for sample gas. The GC shall be calibrated with the sample loop used for sample analysis.</P>

            <P>6.2.2.7 GC Columns. The column system must be demonstrated to be capable of resolving three major reduced sulfur compounds: H<E T="52">2</E>S, COS, and CS<E T="52">2</E>. To demonstrate that adequate resolution has been achieved, a chromatogram of a calibration gas containing all three reduced sulfur compounds in the concentration range of the applicable standard must be submitted. Adequate resolution will be defined as base line separation of adjacent peaks when the amplifier attenuation is set so that the smaller peak is at least 50 percent of full scale. Base line separation is defined as a return to zero (±5 percent) in the interval between peaks. Systems not meeting this criteria may be considered alternate methods subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.3 Calibration System (See Figure 15-3). The calibration system must contain the following components:</P>
            <P>6.3.1 Flow System. To measure air flow over permeation tubes within 2 percent. Each flowmeter shall be calibrated after each complete test series with a wet-test meter. If the flow measuring device differs from the wet-test meter by more than 5 percent, the completed test shall be discarded. Alternatively, use the flow data that will yield the lowest flow measurement. Calibration with a wet-test meter before a test is optional. Flow over the permeation device may also be determined using a soap bubble flowmeter.</P>

            <P>6.3.2 Constant Temperature Bath. Device capable of maintaining the permeation tubes at the calibration temperature within 0.1 °C.<PRTPAGE P="400"/>
            </P>
            <P>6.3.3 Temperature Sensor. Thermometer or equivalent to monitor bath temperature within 0.1 °C.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>
            <P>7.1 Fuel. Hydrogen gas (H<E T="52">2</E>). Prepurified grade or better.</P>
            <P>7.2 Combustion Gas. Oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>) or air, research purity or better.</P>
            <P>7.3 Carrier Gas. Prepurified grade or better.</P>
            <P>7.4 Diluent. Air containing less than 0.5 ppmv total sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppmv each of moisture and total hydrocarbons.</P>
            <P>7.5 Calibration Gases.</P>
            <P>7.5.1 Permeation Devices. One each of H<E T="52">2</E>S, COS, and CS<E T="52">2</E>, gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature. These tubes consist of hermetically sealed FEP Teflon tubing in which a liquified gaseous substance is enclosed. The enclosed gas permeates through the tubing wall at a constant rate. When the temperature is constant, calibration gases covering a wide range of known concentrations can be generated by varying and accurately measuring the flow rate of diluent gas passing over the tubes. These calibration gases are used to calibrate the GC/FPD system and the dilution system.</P>
            <P>7.5.2 Cylinder Gases. Cylinder gases may be used as alternatives to permeation devices. The gases must be traceable to a primary standard (such as permeation tubes) and not used beyond the certification expiration date.</P>
            <P>7.6 Citrate Buffer. Dissolve 300 g of potassium citrate and 41 g of anhydrous citric acid in 1 liter of water. Alternatively, 284 g of sodium citrate may be substituted for the potassium citrate. Adjust the pH to between 5.4 and 5.6 with potassium citrate or citric acid, as required.</P>
            <P>8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage</P>
            <P>8.1 Pretest Procedures. After the complete measurement system has been set up at the site and deemed to be operational, the following procedures should be completed before sampling is initiated. These procedures are not required, but would be helpful in preventing any problem which might occur later to invalidate the entire test.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Leak-Check. Appropriate leak-check procedures should be employed to verify the integrity of all components, sample lines, and connections. The following procedure is suggested: For components upstream of the sample pump, attach the probe end of the sample line to a manometer or vacuum gauge, start the pump and pull a vacuum greater than 50 mm (2 in.) Hg, close off the pump outlet, and then stop the pump and ascertain that there is no leak for 1 minute. For components after the pump, apply a slight positive pressure and check for leaks by applying a liquid (detergent in water, for example) at each joint. Bubbling indicates the presence of a leak. As an alternative to the initial leak-test, the sample line loss test described in section 8.3.1 may be performed to verify the integrity of components.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 System Performance. Since the complete system is calibrated at the beginning and end of each day of testing, the precise calibration of each component is not critical. However, these components should be verified to operate properly. This verification can be performed by observing the response of flowmeters or of the GC output to changes in flow rates or calibration gas concentrations, respectively, and ascertaining the response to be within predicted limits. If any component or the complete system fails to respond in a normal and predictable manner, the source of the discrepancy should be identified and corrected before proceeding.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sample Collection and Analysis</P>
            <P>8.2.1 After performing the calibration procedures outlined in section 10.0, insert the sampling probe into the test port ensuring that no dilution air enters the stack through the port. Begin sampling and dilute the sample approximately 9:1 using the dilution system. Note that the precise dilution factor is the one determined in section 10.4. Condition the entire system with sample for a minimum of 15 minutes before beginning the analysis. Inject aliquots of the sample into the GC/FPD analyzer for analysis. Determine the concentration of each reduced sulfur compound directly from the calibration curves or from the equation for the least-squares line.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 If reductions in sample concentrations are observed during a sample run that cannot be explained by process conditions, the sampling must be interrupted to determine if the probe or filter is clogged with particulate matter. If either is found to be clogged, the test must be stopped and the results up to that point discarded. Testing may resume after cleaning or replacing the probe and filter. After each run, the probe and filter shall be inspected and, if necessary, replaced.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 A sample run is composed of 16 individual analyses (injects) performed over a period of not less than 3 hours or more than 6 hours.</P>
            <P>8.3 Post-Test Procedures.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Sample Line Loss. A known concentration of H<E T="52">2</E>S at the level of the applicable standard, ±20 percent, must be introduced into the sampling system at the opening of the probe in sufficient quantities to ensure that there is an excess of sample which must be vented to the atmosphere. The sample must be transported through the entire sampling system to the measurement system in the same manner as the emission samples. The resulting measured concentration is compared to the known value to determine <PRTPAGE P="401"/>the sampling system loss. For sampling losses greater than 20 percent, the previous sample run is not valid. Sampling losses of 0-20 percent must be corrected by dividing the resulting sample concentration by the fraction of recovery. The known gas sample may be calibration gas as described in section 7.5. Alternatively, cylinder gas containing H<E T="52">2</E>S mixed in nitrogen and verified according to section 7.1.4 of Method 16A may be used. The optional pretest procedures provide a good guideline for determining if there are leaks in the sampling system.</P>

            <P>8.3.2 Determination of Calibration Drift. After each run, or after a series of runs made within a 24-hour period, perform a partial recalibration using the procedures in section 10.0. Only H<E T="52">2</E>S (or other permeant) need be used to recalibrate the GC/FPD analysis system and the dilution system. Partial recalibration may be performed at the midlevel calibration gas concentration or at a concentration measured in the samples but not less than the lowest calibration standard used in the initial calibration. Compare the calibration curves obtained after the runs to the calibration curves obtained under section 10.3. The calibration drift should not exceed the limits set forth in section 13.4. If the drift exceeds this limit, the intervening run or runs should be considered invalid. As an option, the calibration data set that gives the highest sample values may be chosen by the tester.</P>

            <P>Prior to any sampling run, calibrate the system using the following procedures. (If more than one run is performed during any 24-hour period, a calibration need not be performed prior to the second and any subsequent runs. However, the calibration drift must be determined as prescribed in section 8.3.2 after the last run is made within the 24-hour period.)
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>This section outlines steps to be followed for use of the GC/FPD and the dilution system. The calibration procedure does not include detailed instructions because the operation of these systems is complex, and it requires an understanding of the individual system being used. Each system should include a written operating manual describing in detail the operating procedures associated with each component in the measurement system. In addition, the operator should be familiar with the operating principles of the components, particularly the GC/FPD. The references in section 16.0 are recommended for review for this purpose.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>10.1 Calibration Gas Permeation Tube Preparation.</P>
            <P>10.1.1 Insert the permeation tubes into the tube chamber. Check the bath temperature to assure agreement with the calibration temperature of the tubes within 0.1 °C. Allow 24 hours for the tubes to equilibrate. Alternatively, equilibration may be verified by injecting samples of calibration gas at 1-hour intervals. The permeation tubes can be assumed to have reached equilibrium when consecutive hourly samples agree within 5 percent of their mean.</P>
            <P>10.1.2 Vary the amount of air flowing over the tubes to produce the desired concentrations for calibrating the analytical and dilution systems. The air flow across the tubes must at all times exceed the flow requirement of the analytical systems. The concentration in ppmv generated by a tube containing a specific permeant can be calculated using Equation 15-1 in section 12.2.</P>
            <P>10.2 Calibration of Analytical System. Generate a series of three or more known concentrations spanning the linear range of the FPD (approximately 0.5 to 10 ppmv for a 1-ml sample) for each of the three major sulfur compounds. Bypassing the dilution system, inject these standards into the GC/FPD and monitor the responses until three consecutive injections for each concentration agree within 5 percent of their mean. Failure to attain this precision indicates a problem in the calibration or analytical system. Any such problem must be identified and corrected before proceeding.</P>
            <P>10.3 Calibration Curves. Plot the GC/FPD response in current (amperes) versus their causative concentrations in ppmv on log-log coordinate graph paper for each sulfur compound. Alternatively, a least-squares equation may be generated from the calibration data using concentrations versus the appropriate instrument response units.</P>

            <P>10.4 Calibration of Dilution System. Generate a known concentration of H<E T="52">2</E>S using the permeation tube system. Adjust the flow rate of diluent air for the first dilution stage <PRTPAGE P="402"/>so that the desired level of dilution is approximated. Inject the diluted calibration gas into the GC/FPD system until the results of three consecutive injections for each dilution agree within 5 percent of their mean. Failure to attain this precision in this step is an indication of a problem in the dilution system. Any such problem must be identified and corrected before proceeding. Using the calibration data for H<E T="52">2</E>S (developed under section 10.3), determine the diluted calibration gas concentration in ppmv. Then calculate the dilution factor as the ratio of the calibration gas concentration before dilution to the diluted calibration gas concentration determined under this section. Repeat this procedure for each stage of dilution required. Alternatively, the GC/FPD system may be calibrated by generating a series of three or more concentrations of each sulfur compound and diluting these samples before injecting them into the GC/FPD system. These data will then serve as the calibration data for the unknown samples and a separate determination of the dilution factor will not be necessary. However, the precision requirements are still applicable.</P>

            <P>13.1 Range. Coupled with a GC system using a 1-ml sample size, the maximum limit of the FPD for each sulfur compound is approximately 10 ppmv. It may be necessary to <PRTPAGE P="403"/>dilute samples from sulfur recovery plants a hundredfold (99:1), resulting in an upper limit of about 1000 ppmv for each compound.</P>
            <P>13.2 Sensitivity. The minimum detectable concentration of the FPD is also dependent on sample size and would be about 0.5 ppmv for a 1-ml sample.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of emissions of reduced sulfur compounds from sulfur recovery plants where the emissions are in a reducing atmosphere, such as in Stretford units.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack, and combustion air is added to the oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>)-deficient gas at a known rate. The reduced sulfur compounds [including carbon disulfide (CS<E T="52">2</E>), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and hydrogen sulfide (H<E T="52">2</E>S)] are thermally oxidized to sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>), which is then collected in hydrogen peroxide as sulfate ion and analyzed according to the Method 6 barium-thorin titration procedure.</P>

            </HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>
            <P>4.1 Reduced sulfur compounds, other than CS<E T="52">2</E>, COS, and H<E T="52">2</E>S, that are present in the emissions will also be oxidized to SO<E T="52">2</E>, causing a positive bias relative to emission standards that limit only the three compounds listed above. For example, thiophene has been identified in emissions from a Stretford unit and produced a positive bias of 30 percent in the Method 15A result. However, these biases may not affect the outcome of the test at units where emissions are low relative to the standard.</P>
            <P>4.2 Calcium and aluminum have been shown to interfere in the Method 6 titration procedure. Since these metals have been identified in particulate matter emissions from Stretford units, a Teflon filter is required to minimize this interference.</P>
            <P>4.3 Dilution of the hydrogen peroxide (H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>) absorbing solution can potentially reduce collection efficiency, causing a negative bias. When used to sample emissions containing 7 percent moisture or less, the midget impingers have sufficient volume to contain the condensate collected during sampling. Dilution of the H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> does not affect the collection of SO<E T="52">2</E>. At higher moisture contents, the potassium citrate-citric acid buffer system used with Method 16A should be used to collect the condensate.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>6.1 Sample Collection. The sampling train used in performing this method is shown in Figure 15A-1, and component parts are discussed below. Modifications to this sampling train are acceptable provided that the system performance check is met.</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Probe. 6.4-mm (<FR>1/4</FR>-in.) OD Teflon tubing sequentially wrapped with heat-resistant fiber strips, a rubberized heating tape (with a plug at one end), and heat-resistant adhesive tape. A flexible thermocouple or some other suitable temperature-measuring device shall be placed between the Teflon tubing and the fiber strips so that the temperature can be monitored. The probe should be sheathed in stainless steel to provide in-stack rigidity. A series of bored-out stainless steel fittings placed at the front of the sheath will prevent flue gas from entering between the probe and sheath. The sampling probe is depicted in Figure 15A-2.</P>

            <P>6.1.2 Particulate Filter. A 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-mm porosity Teflon filter (available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55345). The filter holder must be <PRTPAGE P="408"/>maintained in a hot box at a temperature high enough to prevent condensation.</P>
            <P>6.1.3 Combustion Air Delivery System. As shown in the schematic diagram in Figure 15A-3. The rate meter should be selected to measure an air flow rate of 0.5 liter/min (0.02 ft<SU>3</SU>/min).</P>
            <P>6.1.4 Combustion Tube. Quartz glass tubing with an expanded combustion chamber 2.54 cm (1 in.) in diameter and at least 30.5 cm (12 in.) long. The tube ends should have an outside diameter of 0.6 cm (<FR>1/4</FR> in.) and be at least 15.3 cm (6 in.) long. This length is necessary to maintain the quartz-glass connector near ambient temperature and thereby avoid leaks. Alternatively, the outlet may be constructed with a 90 degree glass elbow and socket that would fit directly onto the inlet of the first peroxide impinger.</P>
            <P>6.1.5 Furnace. Of sufficient size to enclose the combustion tube. The furnace must have a temperature regulator capable of maintaining the temperature at 1100 ±50 °C (2,012 ±90 °F). The furnace operating temperature must be checked with a thermocouple to ensure accuracy. Lindberg furnaces have been found to be satisfactory.</P>
            <P>6.1.6 Peroxide Impingers, Stopcock Grease, Temperature Sensor, Drying Tube, Valve, Pump, and Barometer. Same as in Method 6, sections 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.4, 6.1.1.5, 6.1.1.6, 6.1.1.7, 6.1.1.8, and 6.1.2, respectively, except that the midget bubbler of Method 6, section 6.1.1.2 is not required.</P>
            <P>6.1.7 Vacuum Gauge and Rate Meter. At least 760 mm Hg (30 in. Hg) gauge and rotameter, or equivalent, capable of measuring flow rate to ±5 percent of the selected flow rate and calibrated as in section 10.2.</P>
            <P>6.1.8 Volume Meter. Dry gas meter capable of measuring the sample volume under the particular sampling conditions with an accuracy of 2 percent.</P>
            <P>6.1.9 U-tube manometer. To measure the pressure at the exit of the combustion gas dry gas meter.</P>
            <P>6.2 Sample Recovery and Analysis. Same as Method 6, sections 6.2 and 6.3, except a 10-ml buret with 0.05-ml graduations is required for titrant volumes of less than 10.0 ml, and the spectrophotometer is not needed.</P>

            <P>7.1.3 Recovery Check Gas. Carbonyl sulfide in nitrogen [100 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or greater, if necessary] in an aluminum cylinder. Concentration certified by the manufacturer with an accuracy of ±2 percent or better, or verified by gas chromatography where the instrument is calibrated with a COS permeation tube.</P>
            <P>7.1.4 Combustion Gas. Air, contained in a gas cylinder equipped with a two-stage regulator. The gas shall contain less than 50 ppb of reduced sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppm total hydrocarbons.</P>
            <P>7.2 Sample Recovery and Analysis. Same as Method 6, sections 7.2 and 7.3.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</HD>

            <P>8.1 Preparation of Sampling Train. For the Method 6 part of the train, measure 20 ml of 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> into the first and second midget impingers. Leave the third midget impinger empty and add silica gel to the fourth impinger. Alternatively, a silica gel drying tube may be used in place of the fourth impinger. Place crushed ice and water around all impingers. Maintain the oxidation furnace at 1100 ±50 °C (2,012 ±90 °F) to ensure 100 percent oxidation of COS. Maintain the probe and filter temperatures at a high enough level (no visible condensation) to prevent moisture condensation and monitor the temperatures with a thermocouple.</P>
            <P>8.2 Leak-Check Procedure. Assemble the sampling train and leak-check as described in Method 6, section 8.2. Include the combustion air delivery system from the needle valve forward in the leak-check.</P>

            <P>8.3 Sample Collection. Adjust the pressure on the second stage of the regulator on the combustion air cylinder to 10 psig. Adjust the combustion air flow rate to 0.5 ±0.05 L/min (1.1 ±0.1 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr) before injecting combustion air into the sampling train. Then inject combustion air into the sampling train, start the sample pump, and open the stack sample gas valve. Carry out these three operations within 15 to 30 seconds to avoid pressurizing the sampling train. Adjust the total sample flow rate to 2.0 ±0.2 L/min (4.2 ±0.4 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr). These flow rates produce an O<E T="52">2</E> concentration of 5.0 percent in the stack gas, which must be maintained constantly to allow oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds to SO<E T="52">2</E>. Adjust these flow rates during sampling as necessary. Monitor and record the combustion air manometer reading at regular intervals during the sampling period. Sample for 1 or 3 hours. At the end of sampling, turn off the sample pump and combustion air simultaneously (within 30 seconds of each other). All other procedures are the same as in Method 6, section 8.3, except that the sampling train should not be purged. After collecting the <PRTPAGE P="409"/>sample, remove the probe from the stack and conduct a leak-check according to the procedures outlined in section 8.2 of Method 6 (mandatory). After each 3-hour test run (or after three 1-hour samples), conduct one system performance check (see section 8.5). After this system performance check and before the next test run, it is recommended that the probe be rinsed and brushed and the filter replaced.

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>In Method 15, a test run is composed of 16 individual analyses (injects) performed over a period of not less than 3 hours or more than 6 hours. For Method 15A to be consistent with Method 15, the following may be used to obtain a test run: (1) Collect three 60-minute samples or (2) collect one 3-hour sample. (Three test runs constitute a test.)</P>

            <P>8.4 Sample Recovery. Recover the hydrogen peroxide-containing impingers as detailed in Method 6, section 8.4.</P>
            <P>8.5 System Performance Check.</P>
            <P>8.5.1 A system performance check is done (1) to validate the sampling train components and procedure (before testing, optional) and (2) to validate a test run (after a run, mandatory). Perform a check in the field before testing consisting of at least two samples (optional), and perform an additional check after each 3-hour run or after three 1-hour samples (mandatory).</P>

            <P>8.5.2 The checks involve sampling a known concentration of COS and comparing the analyzed concentration with the known concentration. Mix the recovery gas with N<E T="52">2</E> as shown in Figure 15A-4 if dilution is required. Adjust the flow rates to generate a COS concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the applicable standard at a total flow rate of at least 2.5 L/min (5.3 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr). Use Equation 15A-4 (see section 12.5) to calculate the concentration of recovery gas generated. Calibrate the flow rate from both sources with a soap bubble flow tube so that the diluted concentration of COS can be accurately calculated. Collect 30-minute samples, and analyze in the same manner as the emission samples. Collect the samples through the probe of the sampling train using a manifold or some other suitable device that will ensure extraction of a representative sample.</P>
            <P>8.5.3 The recovery check must be performed in the field before replacing the particulate filter and before cleaning the probe. A sample recovery of 100 ±20 percent must be obtained for the data to be valid and should be reported with the emission data, but should not be used to correct the data. However, if the performance check results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the Administrator may decide to accept the results of the compliance test. Use Equation 15A-5 (see section 12.6) to calculate the recovery efficiency.</P>

            <P>13.1 Analytical Range. The lower detectable limit is 0.1 ppmv when sampling at 2 lpm for 3 hours or 0.3 ppmv when sampling at 2 lpm for 1 hour. The upper concentration limit of the method exceeds concentrations of reduced sulfur compounds generally encountered in sulfur recovery plants.</P>

            <P>13.2 Precision. Relative standard deviations of 2.8 and 6.9 percent have been obtained when sampling a stream with a reduced sulfur compound concentration of 41 ppmv as SO<E T="52">2</E> for 1 and 3 hours, respectively.</P>
            <P>13.3 Bias. No analytical bias has been identified. However, results obtained with this method are likely to contain a positive bias relative to emission regulations due to the presence of nonregulated sulfur compounds (that are present in petroleum) in the emissions. The magnitude of this bias varies accordingly, and has not been quantified.</P>

            <P>The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.</P>
            <P>Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.</P>
            <P>Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.</P>
            <P>The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.</P>
            <P>Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.</P>
            <P>Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of total reduced sulfur (TRS) compounds from recovery furnaces, lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills and fuel gas combustion devices at petroleum refineries.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The method described below uses the principle of gas chromatographic (GC) separation and flame photometric detection (FPD). Since there are many systems or sets of operating conditions that represent useable methods of determining sulfur emissions, all systems which employ this principle, but differ only in details of equipment and operation, may be used as alternative methods, provided that the calibration precision and sample line loss criteria are met.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 A gas sample is extracted from the emission source and an aliquot is analyzed for hydrogen sulfide (H<E T="52">2</E>S), methyl mercaptan (MeSH), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) by GC/FPD. These four compounds are known collectively as TRS.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions <E T="01">[Reserved]</E>
            </HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>

            <P>4.1 Moisture. Moisture condensation in the sample delivery system, the analytical column, or the FPD burner block can cause losses or interferences. This is prevented by maintaining the probe, filter box, and connections at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F). Moisture is removed in the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber and heating the sample beyond this point is not necessary when the ambient temperature is above 0 °C (32 °F). Alternatively, moisture may be eliminated by heating the sample line, and by conditioning the sample with dry dilution air to lower its dew point below the operating temperature of the GC/FPD analytical system prior to analysis.</P>
            <P>4.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>). CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> have a substantial desensitizing effect on the flame photometric detector even after dilution. Acceptable systems must demonstrate that they have eliminated this interference by some procedure such as eluting these compounds before any of the compounds to be measured. Compliance with this requirement can be demonstrated by submitting chromatograms of calibration gases with and without CO<E T="52">2</E> in the diluent gas. The CO<E T="52">2</E> level should be approximately 10 percent for the case with CO<E T="52">2</E> present. The two chromatograms should show agreement within the precision limits of section 10.2.</P>
            <P>4.3 Particulate Matter. Particulate matter in gas samples can cause interference by eventual clogging of the analytical system. This interference is eliminated by using the Teflon filter after the probe.</P>
            <P>4.4 Sulfur Dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>). Sulfur dioxide is not a specific interferant but may be present in such large amounts that it cannot effectively be separated from the other compounds of interest. The SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber described in section 6.1.3 will effectively remove SO<E T="52">2</E> from the sample.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 Safety</HD>
            <P>5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.</P>

            <P>5.2 Hydrogen Sulfide. A flammable, poisonous gas with the odor of rotten eggs. H<E T="52">2</E>S is extremely hazardous and can cause collapse, coma, and death within a few seconds of one or two inhalations at sufficient concentrations. Low concentrations irritate the mucous membranes and may cause nausea, dizziness, and headache after exposure.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>6.1. Sample Collection. The following items are needed for sample collection.</P>

            <P>6.1.1 Probe. Teflon or Teflon-lined stainless steel. The probe must be heated to prevent moisture condensation. It must be designed to allow calibration gas to enter the probe at or near the sample point entry. Any portion of the probe that contacts the stack gas <PRTPAGE P="418"/>must be heated to prevent moisture condensation. Figure 16-1 illustrates the probe used in lime kilns and other sources where significant amounts of particulate matter are present. The probe is designed with the deflector shield placed between the sample and the gas inlet holes to reduce clogging of the filter and possible adsorption of sample gas. As an alternative, the probe described in section 6.1.1 of Method 16A having a nozzle directed away from the gas stream may be used at sources having significant amounts of particulate matter.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Particulate Filter. 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-micron porosity Teflon filter (available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343). The filter holder must be maintained in a hot box at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F).</P>
            <P>6.1.3 SO<E T="52">2</E> Scrubber. Three 300-ml Teflon segmented impingers connected in series with flexible, thick-walled, Teflon tubing. (Impinger parts and tubing available through Savillex.) The first two impingers contain 100 ml of citrate buffer and the third impinger is initially dry. The tip of the tube inserted into the solution should be constricted to less than 3 mm (<FR>1/8</FR> in.) ID and should be immersed to a depth of at least 5 cm (2 in.). Immerse the impingers in an ice water bath and maintain near 0 °C (32 °F). The scrubber solution will normally last for a 3-hour run before needing replacement. This will depend upon the effects of moisture and particulate matter on the solution strength and pH. Connections between the probe, particulate filter, and SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber must be made of Teflon and as short in length as possible. All portions of the probe, particulate filter, and connections prior to the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber (or alternative point of moisture removal) must be maintained at a temperature of at least 120 °C (248 °F).</P>
            <P>6.1.4 Sample Line. Teflon, no greater than 1.3 cm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) ID. Alternative materials, such as virgin Nylon, may be used provided the line loss test is acceptable.</P>
            <P>6.1.5 Sample Pump. The sample pump must be a leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm type or equivalent.</P>
            <P>6.2 Analysis. The following items are needed for sample analysis:</P>
            <P>6.2.1 Dilution System. Needed only for high sample concentrations. The dilution system must be constructed such that all sample contacts are made of Teflon, glass, or stainless steel.</P>
            <P>6.2.2 Gas Chromatograph. The gas chromatograph must have at least the following components:</P>
            <P>6.2.2.1 Oven. Capable of maintaining the separation column at the proper operating temperature ±1 °C (2 °F).</P>
            <P>6.2.2.2 Temperature Gauge. To monitor column oven, detector, and exhaust temperature ±1 °C (2 °F).</P>
            <P>6.2.2.3 Flow System. Gas metering system to measure sample, fuel, combustion gas, and carrier gas flows.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.4 Flame Photometric Detector.</P>

            <P>6.2.2.4.1 Electrometer. Capable of full scale amplification of linear ranges of 10<E T="51">−9</E> to 10<E T="51">−4</E> amperes full scale.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.4.2 Power Supply. Capable of delivering up to 750 volts.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.4.3 Recorder. Compatible with the output voltage range of the electrometer.</P>
            <P>6.2.2.4.4 Rotary Gas Valves. Multiport Teflon-lined valves equipped with sample loop. Sample loop volumes must be chosen to provide the needed analytical range. Teflon tubing and fittings must be used throughout to present an inert surface for sample gas. The gas chromatograph must be calibrated with the sample loop used for sample analysis.</P>

            <P>6.2.3 Gas Chromatogram Columns. The column system must be demonstrated to be capable of resolving the four major reduced sulfur compounds: H<E T="52">2</E>S, MeSH, DMS, and DMDS. It must also demonstrate freedom from known interferences. To demonstrate that adequate resolution has been achieved, submit a chromatogram of a calibration gas containing all four of the TRS compounds in the concentration range of the applicable standard. Adequate resolution will be defined as base line separation of adjacent peaks when the amplifier attenuation is set so that the smaller peak is at least 50 percent of full scale. Baseline separation is defined as a return to zero ±5 percent in the interval between peaks. Systems not meeting this criteria may be considered alternate methods subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.3 Calibration. A calibration system, containing the following components, is required (see Figure 16-2).</P>
            <P>6.3.1 Tube Chamber. Chamber of glass or Teflon of sufficient dimensions to house permeation tubes.</P>
            <P>6.3.2 Flow System. To measure air flow over permeation tubes at ±2 percent. Flow over the permeation device may also be determined using a soap bubble flowmeter.</P>
            <P>6.3.3 Constant Temperature Bath. Device capable of maintaining the permeation tubes at the calibration temperature within 0.1 °C (0.2 °F).</P>
            <P>6.3.4 Temperature Gauge. Thermometer or equivalent to monitor bath temperature within 1 °C (2 °F).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>
            <P>7.1 Fuel. Hydrogen (H<E T="52">2</E>), prepurified grade or better.</P>
            <P>7.2 Combustion Gas. Oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>) or air, research purity or better.</P>
            <P>7.3 Carrier Gas. Prepurified grade or better.</P>
            <P>7.4 Diluent (if required). Air containing less than 50 ppb total sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppmv each of moisture and total hydrocarbons.</P>
            <P>7.5 Calibration Gases<PRTPAGE P="419"/>
            </P>
            <P>7.5.1 Permeation tubes, one each of H<E T="52">2</E>S, MeSH, DMS, and DMDS, gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature. These tubes consist of hermetically sealed FEP Teflon tubing in which a liquified gaseous substance is enclosed. The enclosed gas permeates through the tubing wall at a constant rate. When the temperature is constant, calibration gases covering a wide range of known concentrations can be generated by varying and accurately measuring the flow rate of diluent gas passing over the tubes. These calibration gases are used to calibrate the GC/FPD system and the dilution system.</P>
            <P>7.5.2 Cylinder Gases. Cylinder gases may be used as alternatives to permeation devices. The gases must be traceable to a primary standard (such as permeation tubes) and not used beyond the certification expiration date.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of TRS emissions from recovery boilers, lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills, reduced sulfur compounds (H<E T="52">2</E>S, carbonyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide) from sulfur recovery units at onshore natural gas processing facilities, and from other sources when specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations. The flue gas must contain at least 1 percent oxygen for complete oxidation of all TRS to SO<E T="52">2</E>. Note: If sources other than kraft pulp mills experience low oxygen levels in the emissions, the method results may be biased low.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack. SO<E T="52">2</E> is removed selectively from the sample using a citrate buffer solution. TRS compounds are then thermally oxidized to SO<E T="52">2</E>, collected in hydrogen peroxide as sulfate, and analyzed by the Method 6 barium-thorin titration procedure.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions <E T="01">[Reserved]</E>
            </HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>

            <P>4.1 Reduced sulfur compounds other than those regulated by the emission standards, if present, may be measured by this method. Therefore, carbonyl sulfide, which is partially oxidized to SO<E T="52">2</E> and may be present in a lime kiln exit stack, would be a positive interferant.</P>

            <P>4.2 Particulate matter from the lime kiln stack gas (primarily calcium carbonate) can cause a negative bias if it is allowed to enter the citrate scrubber; the particulate matter will cause the pH to rise and H<E T="52">2</E>S to be absorbed prior to oxidation. Furthermore, if the calcium carbonate enters the hydrogen peroxide impingers, the calcium will precipitate sulfate ion. Proper use of the particulate filter described in section 6.1.3 will eliminate this interference.</P>

            <P>5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.</P>
            <P>5.2 Corrosive reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal burns.</P>
            <P>5.2.1 Hydrogen Peroxide (H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>). Irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs.</P>
            <P>5.2.2 Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). Causes severe damage to eyes and skin. Inhalation causes irritation to nose, throat, and lungs. Reacts exothermically with limited amounts of water.</P>
            <P>5.2.3 Sulfuric Acid (H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>). Rapidly destructive to body tissue. Will cause third degree burns. Eye damage may result in blindness. Inhalation may be fatal from spasm of the larynx, usually within 30 minutes. May cause lung tissue damage with edema. 3 mg/m<SU>3</SU> will cause lung damage in uninitiated. 1 mg/m<SU>3</SU> for 8 hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals and organics.</P>
            <P>5.3 Hydrogen Sulfide (H<E T="52">2</E>S). A flammable, poisonous gas with the odor of rotten eggs. H<E T="52">2</E>S is extremely hazardous and can cause collapse, coma, and death within a few seconds of one or two inhalations at sufficient concentrations. Low concentrations irritate the mucous membranes and may cause nausea, dizziness, and headache after exposure.</P>

            <P>6.1 Sample Collection. The sampling train is shown in Figure 16A-1 and component parts are discussed below. Modifications to this sampling train are acceptable provided the system performance check is met (see section 8.5).</P>

            <P>6.1.1 Probe. Teflon tubing, 6.4-mm (<FR>1/4</FR>-in.) diameter, sequentially wrapped with heat-resistant fiber strips, a rubberized heat tape <PRTPAGE P="424"/>(plug at one end), and heat-resistant adhesive tape. A flexible thermocouple or other suitable temperature measuring device should be placed between the Teflon tubing and the fiber strips so that the temperature can be monitored to prevent softening of the probe. The probe should be sheathed in stainless steel to provide in-stack rigidity. A series of bored-out stainless steel fittings placed at the front of the sheath will prevent moisture and particulate from entering between the probe and sheath. A 6.4-mm (<FR>1/4</FR>-in.) Teflon elbow (bored out) should be attached to the inlet of the probe, and a 2.54 cm (1 in.) piece of Teflon tubing should be attached at the open end of the elbow to permit the opening of the probe to be turned away from the particulate stream; this will reduce the amount of particulate drawn into the sampling train. The probe is depicted in Figure 16A-2.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Probe Brush. Nylon bristle brush with handle inserted into a 3.2-mm (<FR>1/8</FR>-in.) Teflon tubing. The Teflon tubing should be long enough to pass the brush through the length of the probe.</P>
            <P>6.1.3 Particulate Filter. 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-µm porosity, Teflon filter (available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343). The filter holder must be maintained in a hot box at a temperature sufficient to prevent moisture condensation. A temperature of 121 °C (250 °F) was found to be sufficient when testing a lime kiln under sub-freezing ambient conditions.</P>
            <P>6.1.4 SO<E T="52">2</E> Scrubber. Three 300-ml Teflon segmented impingers connected in series with flexible, thick-walled, Teflon tubing. (Impinger parts and tubing available through Savillex.) The first two impingers contain 100 ml of citrate buffer and the third impinger is initially dry. The tip of the tube inserted into the solution should be constricted to less than 3 mm (<FR>1/8</FR>-in.) ID and should be immersed to a depth of at least 5 cm (2 in.).</P>
            <P>6.1.5 Combustion Tube. Quartz glass tubing with an expanded combustion chamber 2.54 cm (1 in.) in diameter and at least 30.5 cm (12 in.) long. The tube ends should have an outside diameter of 0.6 cm (<FR>1/4</FR> in.) and be at least 15.3 cm (6 in.) long. This length is necessary to maintain the quartz-glass connector near ambient temperature and thereby avoid leaks. Alternatively, the outlet may be constructed with a 90-degree glass elbow and socket that would fit directly onto the inlet of the first peroxide impinger.</P>
            <P>6.1.6 Furnace. A furnace of sufficient size to enclose the combustion chamber of the combustion tube with a temperature regulator capable of maintaining the temperature at 800 ±100 °C (1472 ±180 °F). The furnace operating temperature should be checked with a thermocouple to ensure accuracy.</P>
            <P>6.1.7 Peroxide Impingers, Stopcock Grease, Temperature Sensor, Drying Tube, Valve, Pump, and Barometer. Same as Method 6, sections 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.4, 6.1.1.5, 6.1.1.6, 6.1.1.7, 6.1.1.8, and 6.1.2, respectively, except that the midget bubbler of Method 6, section 6.1.1.2 is not required.</P>
            <P>6.1.8 Vacuum Gauge. At least 760 mm Hg (30 in. Hg) gauge.</P>
            <P>6.1.9 Rate Meter. Rotameter, or equivalent, accurate to within 5 percent at the selected flow rate of approximately 2 liters/min (4.2 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr).</P>
            <P>6.1.10 Volume Meter. Dry gas meter capable of measuring the sample volume under the sampling conditions of 2 liters/min (4.2 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr) with an accuracy of 2 percent.</P>
            <P>6.2 Sample Recovery. Polyethylene Bottles, 250-ml (one per sample).</P>
            <P>6.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis. Same as Method 6, section 6.3, except a 10-ml buret with 0.05-ml graduations is required, and the spectrophotometer is not needed.</P>

            <P>7.1 Sample Collection. The following reagents are required for sample analysis:</P>
            <P>7.1.1 Water. Same as in Method 6, section 7.1.1.</P>
            <P>7.1.2 Citrate Buffer. Dissolve 300 g of potassium citrate (or 284 g of sodium citrate) and 41 g of anhydrous citric acid in 1 liter of water (200 ml is needed per test). Adjust the pH to between 5.4 and 5.6 with potassium citrate or citric acid, as required.</P>
            <P>7.1.3 Hydrogen Peroxide, 3 percent. Same as in Method 6, section 7.1.3 (40 ml is needed per sample).</P>

            <P>7.1.4 Recovery Check Gas. Hydrogen sulfide (100 ppmv or less) in nitrogen, stored in aluminum cylinders. Verify the concentration by Method 11 or by gas chromatography where the instrument is calibrated with an H<E T="52">2</E>S permeation tube as described below. For Method 11, the relative standard deviation should not exceed 5 percent on at least three 20-minute runs.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

              <P>Alternatively, hydrogen sulfide recovery gas generated from a permeation device gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature may be used. The permeation rate of the device must be such that at a dilution gas flow rate of 3 liters/min (6.4 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr), an H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the standard can be generated.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>7.1.5 Combustion Gas. Gas containing less than 50 ppb reduced sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppmv total hydrocarbons. The <PRTPAGE P="425"/>gas may be generated from a clean-air system that purifies ambient air and consists of the following components: Diaphragm pump, silica gel drying tube, activated charcoal tube, and flow rate measuring device. Flow from a compressed air cylinder is also acceptable.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</HD>
            <P>8.1 Preparation of Sampling Train.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 For the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber, measure 100 ml of citrate buffer into the first and second impingers; leave the third impinger empty. Immerse the impingers in an ice bath, and locate them as close as possible to the filter heat box. The connecting tubing should be free of loops. Maintain the probe and filter temperatures sufficiently high to prevent moisture condensation, and monitor with a suitable temperature sensor.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 For the Method 6 part of the train, measure 20 ml of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide into the first and second midget impingers. Leave the third midget impinger empty, and place silica gel in the fourth midget impinger. Alternatively, a silica gel drying tube may be used in place of the fourth impinger. Maintain the oxidation furnace at 800 ±100 °C (1472 ±180 °F). Place crushed ice and water around all impingers.</P>
            <P>8.2 Citrate Scrubber Conditioning Procedure. Condition the citrate buffer scrubbing solution by pulling stack gas through the Teflon impingers and bypassing all other sampling train components. A purge rate of 2 liters/min for 10 minutes has been found to be sufficient to obtain equilibrium. After the citrate scrubber has been conditioned, assemble the sampling train, and conduct (optional) a leak-check as described in Method 6, section 8.2.</P>

            <P>8.3 Sample Collection. Same as in Method 6, section 8.3, except the sampling rate is 2 liters/min (±10 percent) for 1 or 3 hours. After the sample is collected, remove the probe from the stack, and conduct (mandatory) a post-test leak-check as described in Method 6, section 8.2. The 15-minute purge of the train following collection should not be performed. After each 3-hour test run (or after three 1-hour samples), conduct one system performance check (see section 8.5) to determine the reduced sulfur recovery efficiency through the sampling train. After this system performance check and before the next test run, rinse and brush the probe with water, replace the filter, and change the citrate scrubber (optional but recommended).

              <P>In Method 16, a test run is composed of 16 individual analyses (injects) performed over a period of not less than 3 hours or more than 6 hours. For Method 16A to be consistent with Method 16, the following may be used to obtain a test run: (1) collect three 60-minute samples or (2) collect one 3-hour sample.

            <P>8.5 System Performance Check.</P>
            <P>8.5.1 A system performance check is done (1) to validate the sampling train components and procedure (prior to testing; optional) and (2) to validate a test run (after a run). Perform a check in the field prior to testing consisting of at least two samples (optional), and perform an additional check after each 3 hour run or after three 1-hour samples (mandatory).</P>

            <P>8.5.2 The checks involve sampling a known concentration of H<E T="52">2</E>S and comparing the analyzed concentration with the known concentration. Mix the H<E T="52">2</E>S recovery check gas (Section 7.1.4) and combustion gas in a dilution system such as that shown in Figure 16A-3. Adjust the flow rates to generate an H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the applicable standard and an oxygen concentration greater than 1 percent at a total flow rate of at least 2.5 liters/min (5.3 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr). Use Equation 16A-3 to calculate the concentration of recovery gas generated. Calibrate the flow rate from both sources with a soap bubble flow meter so that the diluted concentration of H<E T="52">2</E>S can be accurately calculated.</P>
            <P>8.5.3 Collect 30-minute samples, and analyze in the same manner as the emission samples. Collect the sample through the probe of the sampling train using a manifold or some other suitable device that will ensure extraction of a representative sample.</P>

            <P>8.5.4 The recovery check must be performed in the field prior to replacing the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber and particulate filter and before the probe is cleaned. Use Equation 16A-4 (see section 12.5) to calculate the recovery efficiency. Report the recovery efficiency with the emission data; do not correct the emission data for the recovery efficiency. A sample recovery of 100 ±20 percent must be obtained for the emission data to be valid. However, if the recovery efficiency is not in the 100 ±20 percent range but the results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the Administrator may decide to accept the results of the compliance test.</P>

            <P>16.7 Pre-test Procedures.</P>

            <P>16.7.1 Selection of Gas Sample Volumes. This procedure has been validated for estimating the volume of cylinder gas sample needed when the H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration is in the range of 5 to 1500 ppmv. The sample volume ranges were selected in order to ensure a 35 to 60 percent consumption of the 20 ml of 0.01 N iodine (thus ensuring a 0.01 N Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E> titer of approximately 7 to 12 ml). The sample volumes for various H<E T="52">2</E>S concentrations can be estimated by dividing the approximate ppm-liters desired for a given concentration range by the H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration stated by the manufacturer. For example, for analyzing a cylinder gas containing approximately 10 ppmv H<E T="52">2</E>S, the optimum sample volume is 65 liters (650 ppm-liters/10 ppmv). For analyzing a cylinder gas containing approximately 1000 ppmv H<E T="52">2</E>S, the optimum sample volume is 1 liter (1000 ppm-liters/1000 ppmv).</P>

            <P>16.7.4 Determination of Critical Orifice Approximate Flow Rate. Connect the critical orifice to the sampling system as shown in Figure 16A-4 but without the H<E T="52">2</E>S cylinder. Connect a rotameter in the line to the first impinger. Turn on the pump, and adjust the <PRTPAGE P="429"/>valve to give a reading of about half atmospheric pressure. Observe the rotameter reading. Slowly increase the vacuum until a stable flow rate is reached, and record this as the critical vacuum. The measured flow rate indicates the expected critical flow rate of the orifice. If this flow rate is in the range shown in section 16.7.2, proceed with the critical orifice calibration according to section 16.12.4.</P>
            <P>16.7.5 Determination of Approximate Sampling Time. Determine the approximate sampling time for a cylinder of known concentration. Use the optimum sample volume obtained in section 16.7.1.</P>

            </MATH>
            <P>16.8 Sample Collection.</P>
            <P>16.8.1 Connect the Teflon tubing, Teflon tee, and rotameter to the flow control needle valve as shown in Figure 16A-4. Vent the rotameter to an exhaust hood. Plug the open end of the tee. Five to 10 minutes prior to sampling, open the cylinder valve while keeping the flow control needle valve closed. Adjust the delivery pressure to 20 psi. Open the needle valve slowly until the rotameter shows a flow rate approximately 50 to 100 ml above the flow rate of the critical orifice being used in the system.</P>
            <P>16.8.2 Place 50 ml of zinc acetate solution in two of the impingers, connect them and the empty third impinger (dropout bottle) and the rest of the equipment as shown in Figure 16A-4. Make sure the ground-glass fittings are tight. The impingers can be easily stabilized by using a small cardboard box in which three holes have been cut, to act as a holder. Connect the Teflon sample line to the first impinger. Cover the impingers with a dark cloth or piece of plastic to protect the absorbing solution from light during sampling.</P>
            <P>16.8.3 Record the temperature and barometric pressure. Note the gas flow rate through the rotameter. Open the closed end of the tee. Connect the sampling tube to the tee, ensuring a tight connection. Start the sampling pump and stopwatch simultaneously. Note the decrease in flow rate through the excess flow rotameter. This decrease should equal the known flow rate of the critical orifice being used. Continue sampling for the period determined in section 16.7.5.</P>
            <P>16.8.4 When sampling is complete, turn off the pump and stopwatch. Disconnect the sampling line from the tee and plug it. Close the needle valve followed by the cylinder valve. Record the sampling time.</P>

            <P>16.9 Blank Analysis. While the sample is being collected, run a blank as follows: To a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 100 ml of zinc acetate solution, 20.0 ml of 0.01 N iodine solution, and 2 ml HCl solution. Titrate, while stirring, with 0.01 N Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E> until the solution is light yellow. Add starch, and continue titrating until the blue color disappears. Analyze a blank with each sample, as the blank titer has been observed to change over the course of a day.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Iodine titration of zinc acetate solutions is difficult to perform because the solution turns slightly white in color near the end point, and the disappearance of the blue color is hard to recognize. In addition, a blue color may reappear in the solution about 30 to 45 seconds after the titration endpoint is reached. This should not be taken to mean the original endpoint was in error. It is recommended that persons conducting this test perform several titrations to be able to correctly identify the endpoint. The importance of this should be recognized because the results of this analytical procedure are extremely sensitive to errors in titration.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>16.10 Sample Analysis. Sample treatment is similar to the blank treatment. Before detaching the stems from the bottoms of the impingers, add 20.0 ml of 0.01 N iodine solution through the stems of the impingers holding the zinc acetate solution, dividing it between the two (add about 15 ml to the first impinger and the rest to the second). Add 2 ml HCl solution through the stems, dividing it as with the iodine. Disconnect the sampling line, and store the impingers for 30 minutes. At the end of 30 minutes, rinse the impinger stems into the impinger bottoms. Titrate the impinger contents with 0.01 N Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E>. Do not transfer the contents of the impinger to a flask because this may result in a loss of iodine and cause a positive bias.</P>

            <P>16.11 Post-test Orifice Calibration. Conduct a post-test critical orifice calibration run using the calibration procedures outlined in section 16.12.4. If the Q<E T="52">std</E> obtained before and after the test differs by more than 5 percent, void the sample; if not, proceed to perform the calculations.</P>
            <P>16.12 Calibrations and Standardizations.</P>
            <P>16.12.1 Rotameter and Barometer. Same as Method 11, sections 10.1.3 and 10.1.4.</P>
            <P>16.12.2 Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E> Solution, 0.1 N. Standardize the 0.1 N Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E> solution as follows: To 80 ml water, stirring constantly, add 1 ml concentrated H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>, 10.0 ml of 0.100 N KH(IO<E T="52">3</E>)<E T="52">2</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="430"/>and 1 g potassium iodide. Titrate immediately with 0.1 N Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E> until the solution is light yellow. Add 3 ml starch solution, and titrate until the blue color just disappears. Repeat the titration until replicate analyses agree within 0.05 ml. Take the average volume of Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E> consumed to calculate the normality to three decimal figures using Equation 16A-5.</P>

            <P>16.12.3 Iodine Solution, 0.01 N. Standardize the 0.01 N iodine solution as follows: Pipet 20.0 ml of 0.01 N iodine solution into a 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Titrate with standard 0.01 N Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E> solution until the solution is light yellow. Add 3 ml starch solution, and continue titrating until the blue color just disappears. If the normality of the iodine tested is not 0.010, add a few ml of 0.1 N iodine solution if it is low, or a few ml of water if it is high, and standardize again. Repeat the titration until replicate values agree within 0.05 ml. Take the average volume to calculate the normality to three decimal figures using Equation 16A-6.</P>

            <P>16.12.4 Critical Orifice. Calibrate the critical orifice using the sampling train shown in Figure 16A-4 but without the H<E T="52">2</E>S cylinder and vent rotameter. Connect the soap bubble meter to the Teflon line that is connected to the first impinger. Turn on the pump, and adjust the needle valve until the vacuum is higher than the critical vacuum determined in section 16.7.4. Record the time required for gas flow to equal the soap bubble meter volume (use the 100-ml soap bubble meter for gas flow rates below 100 ml/min, otherwise use the 500-ml soap bubble meter). Make three runs, and record the data listed in Table 16A-1. Use these data to calculate the volumetric flow rate of the orifice.</P>

This method is applicable for determining TRS emissions from recovery furnaces (boilers), lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills, and from other sources when specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations. The flue gas must contain at least 1 percent oxygen for complete oxidation of all TRS to SO<E T="52">2</E>.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack. The SO<E T="52">2</E> is removed selectively from the sample using a citrate buffer solution. The TRS compounds are then thermally oxidized to SO<E T="52">2</E> and analyzed as SO<E T="52">2</E> by gas chromatography (GC) using flame photometric detection (FPD).</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>

            <P>4.1 Reduced sulfur compounds other than those regulated by the emission standards, if present, may be measured by this method. Therefore, carbonyl sulfide, which is partially oxidized to SO<E T="52">2</E> and may be present in a lime kiln exit stack, would be a positive interferant.</P>

            <P>4.2 Particulate matter from the lime kiln stack gas (primarily calcium carbonate) can cause a negative bias if it is allowed to enter the citrate scrubber; the particulate matter will cause the pH to rise and H<E T="52">2</E>S to be absorbed before oxidation. Proper use of the particulate filter, described in section 6.1.3 of Method 16A, will eliminate this interference.</P>
            <P>4.3 Carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) have substantial desensitizing effects on the FPD even after dilution. Acceptable systems must demonstrate that they have eliminated this interference by some procedure such as eluting these compounds before the SO<E T="52">2</E>. Compliance with this requirement can be demonstrated by submitting chromatograms of calibration gases with and without CO<E T="52">2</E> in diluent gas. The CO<E T="52">2</E> level should be approximately 10 percent for the case with CO<E T="52">2</E> present. The two chromatograms should show agreement within the precision limits of section 13.0.</P>

            <P>Same as in Method 16, section 7.0, except for the following:</P>
            <P>7.1 Calibration Gas. SO<E T="52">2</E> permeation tube gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature. These tubes consist of hermetically sealed FEP Teflon tubing in which a liquefied gaseous substance is enclosed. The enclosed gas permeates through the tubing wall at a constant rate. When the temperature is constant, calibration gases covering a wide range of known concentrations can be generated by varying and accurately measuring the flow rate of diluent gas passing over the tubes. In place of SO<E T="52">2</E> permeation tubes, cylinder gases containing SO<E T="52">2</E> in nitrogen may be used for calibration. The cylinder gas concentration must be verified according to section 8.2.1 of Method 6C. The calibration gas is used to calibrate the GC/FPD system and the dilution system.</P>
            <P>7.2 Recovery Check Gas.</P>

            <P>7.2.1 Hydrogen sulfide [100 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or less] in nitrogen, stored in aluminum cylinders. Verify the concentration by Method 11, the procedure discussed in section 16.0 of Method 16A, or gas chromatography where the instrument is calibrated with an H<E T="52">2</E>S permeation tube as described below. For the wet-chemical methods, the standard deviation should not exceed 5 percent on at least three 20-minute runs.</P>

            <P>7.2.2 Hydrogen sulfide recovery gas generated from a permeation device gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operation temperature may be used. The permeation rate of the device must be such that at a dilution gas flow rate of 3 liters/min (64 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr), an H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the emission standard can be generated.</P>
            <P>7.3 Combustion Gas. Gas containing less than 50 ppbv reduced sulfur compounds and less than 10 ppmv total hydrocarbons. The gas may be generated from a clean-air system that purifies ambient air and consists of the following components: diaphragm pump, silica gel drying tube, activated charcoal tube, and flow rate measuring device. Gas from a compressed air cylinder is also acceptable.</P>

            <P>8.1 Pretest Procedures. Same as in Method 15, section 8.1.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sample Collection. Before any source sampling is performed, conduct a system performance check as detailed in section 8.4.1 to validate the sampling train components and procedures. Although this test is optional, it would significantly reduce the possibility of rejecting tests as a result of failing the post-test performance check. At the completion of the pretest system performance check, insert the sampling probe into the test port making certain that no dilution air enters the stack though the port. Condition the entire system with sample for a minimum of 15 minutes before beginning analysis. If the sample is diluted, determine the dilution factor as in section 10.4 of Method 15.</P>

            <P>8.3 Analysis. Inject aliquots of the sample into the GC/FPD analyzer for analysis. Determine the concentration of SO<E T="52">2</E> directly from the calibration curves or from the equation for the least-squares line.</P>

            <P>The measurement system is similar to those applicable components in Methods 16A and 6C. Modifications to the apparatus are accepted provided the performance criteria in section 13.0 are met.</P>
            <P>6.1 Probe. Teflon tubing, 6.4-mm (<FR>1/4</FR> in.) diameter, sequentially wrapped with heat-resistant fiber strips, a rubberized heat tape (plug at one end), and heat-resistant adhesive tape. A flexible thermocouple or other suitable temperature measuring device must be placed between the Teflon tubing and the fiber strips so that the temperature can be monitored to prevent softening of the probe. The probe must be sheathed in stainless steel to provide in-stack rigidity. A series of bored-out stainless steel fittings placed at the front of the sheath will prevent moisture and particulate from entering between the probe and sheath. A 6.4-mm (<FR>1/4</FR> in.) Teflon elbow (bored out) must be attached to the inlet of the probe, and a 2.54 cm (1 in.) piece of Teflon tubing must be attached at the open end of the elbow to permit the opening of the probe to be turned away from the particulate stream; this will reduce the amount of particulate drawn into the sampling train. The probe is depicted in Figure 16A-2 of Method 16A.</P>

            <P>6.2 Probe Brush. Nylon bristle brush with handle inserted into a 3.2-mm (<FR>1/8</FR> in.) Teflon <PRTPAGE P="441"/>tubing. The Teflon tubing should be long enough to pass the brush through the length of the probe.</P>
            <P>6.3 Particulate Filter. 50-mm Teflon filter holder and a 1- to 2-µm porosity, Teflon filter (may be available through Savillex Corporation, 5325 Highway 101, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343, or other suppliers of filters). The filter holder must be maintained in a hot box at a temperature sufficient to prevent moisture condensation. A temperature of 121 °C (250 °F) was found to be sufficient when testing a lime kiln under sub-freezing ambient conditions.</P>
            <P>6.4 SO<E T="52">2</E> Scrubber. Three 300-ml Teflon segmented impingers connected in series with flexible, thick-walled, Teflon tubing. (Impinger parts and tubing may be available through Savillex or other suppliers.) The first two impingers contain 100 ml of citrate buffer, and the third impinger is initially dry. The tip of the tube inserted into the solution should be constricted to less than 3 mm (<FR>1/8</FR> in.) ID and should be immersed to a depth of at least 5 cm (2 in.).</P>
            <P>6.5 Combustion Tube. Quartz glass tubing with an expanded combustion chamber 2.54 cm (1 in.) in diameter and at least 30.5 cm (12 in.) long. The tube ends should have an outside diameter of 0.6 cm (<FR>1/4</FR> in.) and be at least 15.3 cm (6 in.) long. This length is necessary to maintain the quartz-glass connector near ambient temperature and thereby avoid leaks. Alternative combustion tubes are acceptable provided they are shown to combust TRS at concentrations encountered during tests.</P>
            <P>6.6 Furnace. A furnace of sufficient size to enclose the combustion chamber of the combustion tube with a temperature regulator capable of maintaining the temperature at 800 ±100 °C (1472 ±180 °F). The furnace operating temperature should be checked with a thermocouple to ensure accuracy.</P>
            <P>6.7 Sampling Pump. A leak-free pump is required to pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system and must be constructed of material that is non-reactive to the gas it contacts. For dilution-type measurement systems, an eductor pump may be used to create a vacuum that draws the sample through a critical orifice at a constant rate.</P>
            <P>6.8 Calibration Gas Manifold. The calibration gas manifold must allow the introduction of calibration gases either directly to the gas analyzer in direct calibration mode or into the measurement system, at the probe, in system calibration mode, or both, depending upon the type of system used. In system calibration mode, the system must be able to flood the sampling probe and vent excess gas. Alternatively, calibration gases may be introduced at the calibration valve following the probe. Maintain a constant pressure in the gas manifold. For in-stack dilution-type systems, a gas dilution subsystem is required to transport large volumes of purified air to the sample probe, and a probe controller is needed to maintain the proper dilution ratio.</P>

            <P>6.9 Sample Gas Manifold. The sample gas manifold diverts a portion of the sample to the analyzer, delivering the remainder to the by-pass discharge vent. The manifold should also be able to introduce calibration gases directly to the analyzer. The manifold must be made of material that is non-reactive to SO<E T="52">2</E> and be configured to safely discharge the bypass gas.</P>
            <P>6.10 SO<E T="52">2</E> Analyzer. You must use an instrument that uses an ultraviolet, non-dispersive infrared, fluorescence, or other detection principle to continuously measure SO<E T="52">2</E> in the gas stream provided it meets the performance specifications in section 13.0.</P>
            <P>6.11 Data Recording. A strip chart recorder, computerized data acquisition system, digital recorder, or data logger for recording measurement data must be used.</P>

            <FP>For fluorescence-based analyzers, the O<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations of the calibration gases as introduced to the analyzer must be within 1.0 percent (absolute) O<E T="52">2</E> and 1.0 percent (absolute) CO<E T="52">2</E> of the O<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations of the effluent samples as introduced to the analyzer. Alternatively, for fluorescence-based analyzers, use calibration blends of SO<E T="52">2</E> in air and the nomographs provided by <PRTPAGE P="442"/>the vendor to determine the quenching correction factor (the effluent O<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations must be known). This requirement does not apply to ambient-level fluorescence analyzers that are used in conjunction with sample dilution systems. Alternatively, H<E T="52">2</E>S in O<E T="52">2</E> or air may be used to calibrate the analyzer through the tube furnace.</FP>
            <P>7.4 System Performance Check Gas. You must use H<E T="52">2</E>S (100 ppmv or less) stored in aluminum cylinders with the concentration certified by the manufacturer. Hydrogen sulfide in nitrogen is more stable than H<E T="52">2</E>S in air, but air may be used as the balance gas.

              <P>Alternatively, H<E T="52">2</E>S recovery gas generated from a permeation device gravimetrically calibrated and certified at some convenient operating temperature may be used. The permeation rate of the device must be such that at the appropriate dilution gas flow rate, an H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration can be generated in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the emission standard.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>7.5 Interference Check. Examples of test gases for the interference check are listed in Table 7E-3 of Method 7E.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</HD>
            <P>8.1 Pre-sampling Tests. Before measuring emissions, perform the following procedures:</P>
            <P>(a) Calibration gas verification,</P>
            <P>(b) Calibration error test,</P>
            <P>(c) System performance check,</P>
            <P>(d) Verification that the interference check has been satisfied.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Calibration Gas Verification. Obtain a certificate from the gas manufacturer documenting the quality of the gas. Confirm that the manufacturer certification is complete and current. Ensure that your calibration gas certifications have not expired. This documentation should be available on-site for inspection. To the extent practicable, select a high-level gas concentration that will result in the measured emissions being between 20 and 100 percent of the calibration span.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Analyzer Calibration Error Test. After you have assembled, prepared, and calibrated your sampling system and analyzer, you must conduct a 3-point analyzer calibration error test before the first run and again after any failed system performance check or failed drift test to ensure the calibration is acceptable. Introduce the low-, mid-, and high-level calibration gases sequentially to the analyzer in direct calibration mode. For each calibration gas, calculate the analyzer calibration error using Equation 16C-1 in section 12.2. The calibration error for the low-, mid-, and high-level gases must not exceed 5.0 percent or 0.5 ppmv. If the calibration error specification is not met, take corrective action and repeat the test until an acceptable 3-point calibration is achieved.</P>

            <P>8.1.3 System Performance Check. A system performance check is done (1) to validate the sampling train components and procedure (prior to testing), and (2) to validate a test run (after a run). You must conduct a performance check in the field prior to testing, and after each 3-hour run or after three 1-hour runs. A performance check consists of sampling and analyzing a known concentration of H<E T="52">2</E>S (system performance check gas) and comparing the analyzed concentration to the known concentration. To conduct the system performance check, mix the system performance check gas (Section 7.4) and ambient air, that has been conditioned to remove moisture and sulfur-containing gases, in a dilution system such as that shown in Figure 16A-3 of Method 16A. Alternatively, ultra-high purity (UHP) grade air may be used. Adjust the gas flow rates to generate an H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration in the range of the stack gas or within 20 percent of the applicable standard and an oxygen concentration greater than 1 percent at a total flow rate of at least 2.5 liters/min (5.3 ft3/hr). Use Equation 16A-3 from Method 16A to calculate the concentration of system performance check gas generated. Calibrate the flow rate from both gas sources with a soap bubble flow meter so that the diluted concentration of H<E T="52">2</E>S can be accurately calculated. Alternatively, mass flow controllers with documented calibrations may be used if UHP grade air is being used. Sample duration should be sufficiently long to ensure a stable response from the analyzer. Analyze in the same manner as the emission samples. Collect the sample through the probe of the sampling train using a manifold or other suitable device that will ensure extraction of a representative sample. The TRS sample concentration measured between system performance checks is corrected by the average of the pre- and post-system performance checks.</P>
            <P>8.1.4 Interference Check. Same as in Method 7E, section 8.2.7.</P>
            <P>8.2 Measurement System Preparation.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 For the SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber, measure 100 ml of citrate buffer into the first and second impingers; leave the third impinger empty. Immerse the impingers in an ice bath, and locate them as close as possible to the filter heat box. The connecting tubing should be free of loops. Maintain the probe and filter temperatures sufficiently high to prevent moisture condensation, and monitor with a suitable temperature sensor. Prepare the oxidation furnace and maintain at 800 ±100 °C (1472 ±180 °F).</P>

            <P>8.2.2 Citrate Scrubber Conditioning Procedure. Condition the citrate buffer scrubbing solution by pulling stack gas through the Teflon impingers as described in section 8.4.1.<PRTPAGE P="443"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.3 Pretest Procedures. After the complete measurement system has been set up at the site and deemed to be operational, the following procedures must be completed before sampling is initiated.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Leak-Check. Appropriate leak-check procedures must be employed to verify the integrity of all components, sample lines, and connections. For components upstream of the sample pump, attach the probe end of the sample line to a manometer or vacuum gauge, start the pump and pull a vacuum greater than 50 mm (2 in.) Hg, close off the pump outlet, and then stop the pump and ascertain that there is no leak for 1 minute. For components after the pump, apply a slight positive pressure and check for leaks by applying a liquid (detergent in water, for example) at each joint. Bubbling indicates the presence of a leak.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Initial System Performance Check. A system performance check using the test gas (Section 7.4) is performed prior to testing to validate the sampling train components and procedure.</P>
            <P>8.4 Sample Collection and Analysis.</P>
            <P>8.4.1 After performing the required pretest procedures described in section 8.1, insert the sampling probe into the test port ensuring that no dilution air enters the stack through the port. Condition the sampling system and citrate buffer solution for a minimum of 15 minutes before beginning analysis. Begin sampling and analysis. A source test consists of three test runs. A test run shall consist of a single sample collected over a 3-hour period or three separate 1-hour samples collected over a period not to exceed six hours.</P>
            <P>8.5 Post-Run Evaluations.</P>
            <P>8.5.1 System Performance Check. Perform a post-run system performance check before replacing the citrate buffer solution and particulate filter and before the probe is cleaned. The check results must not exceed the 100 ±20 percent limit set forth in section 13.2. If this limit is exceeded, the intervening run is considered invalid. However, if the recovery efficiency is not in the 100 ±20 percent range, but the results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the Administrator may decide to accept the results of the compliance test.</P>
            <P>8.5.2 Calibration Drift. After a run or series of runs, not to exceed a 24-hour period after initial calibration, perform a calibration drift test using a calibration gas (preferably the level that best approximates the sample concentration) in direct calibration mode. This drift must not differ from the initial calibration error percent by more than 3.0 percent or 0.5 ppm. If the drift exceeds this limit, the intervening run or runs are considered valid, but a new analyzer calibration error test must be performed and passed before continuing sampling.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

              <P>Particulate matter is not an absolute quantity. It is a function of temperature and pressure. Therefore, to prevent variability in PM emission regulations and/or associated test methods, the temperature and pressure at which PM is to be measured must be carefully defined. Of the two variables (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> temperature and pressure), temperature has the greater effect upon the amount of PM in an effluent gas stream; in most stationary source categories, the effect of pressure appears to be negligible. In Method 5, 120 °C (248 °F) is established as a nominal reference temperature. Thus, where Method 5 is specified in an applicable subpart of the standard, PM is defined with respect to temperature. In order to maintain a collection temperature of 120 °C (248 °F), Method 5 employs a heated glass sample probe and a heated filter holder. This equipment is somewhat cumbersome and requires care in its operation. Therefore, where PM concentrations (over the normal range of temperature associated with a specified source category) are known to be independent of temperature, it is desirable to eliminate the glass probe and the heating systems, and to sample at stack temperature.</P>

This method is applicable for the determination of PM emissions, where PM concentrations are known to be independent of temperature over the normal range of temperatures characteristic of emissions from a specified source category. It is intended to be used only when specified by an applicable subpart of the standards, and only within the applicable temperature limits (if specified), or when otherwise approved by the Administrator. This method is not applicable to stacks that contain liquid droplets or are saturated with water vapor. In addition, this method shall not be used as written if the projected cross-sectional area of the probe extension-filter holder assembly covers more than 5 percent of the stack cross-sectional area (see section 8.1.2).</P>

            <P>5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>6.1 Sampling Train. A schematic of the sampling train used in this method is shown in Figure 17-1. The sampling train components and operation and maintenance are very similar to Method 5, which should be consulted for details.</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Probe Nozzle, Differential Pressure Gauge, Metering System, Barometer, Gas Density Determination Equipment. Same as in Method 5, sections 6.1.1, 6.1.4, 6.1.8, 6.1.9, and 6.1.10, respectively.</P>

            <P>6.1.2 Filter Holder. The in-stack filter holder shall be constructed of borosilicate or <PRTPAGE P="446"/>quartz glass, or stainless steel. If a gasket is used, it shall be made of silicone rubber, Teflon, or stainless steel. Other holder and gasket materials may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. The filter holder shall be designed to provide a positive seal against leakage from the outside or around the filter.</P>
            <P>6.1.3 Probe Extension. Any suitable rigid probe extension may be used after the filter holder.</P>
            <P>6.1.4 Pitot Tube. Same as in Method 5, section 6.1.3.</P>
            <P>6.1.4.1 It is recommended (1) that the pitot tube have a known baseline coefficient, determined as outlined in section 10 of Method 2; and (2) that this known coefficient be preserved by placing the pitot tube in an interference-free arrangement with respect to the sampling nozzle, filter holder, and temperature sensor (see Figure 17-1). Note that the 1.9 cm (<FR>3/4</FR>-in.) free-space between the nozzle and pitot tube shown in Figure 17-1, is based on a 1.3 cm (<FR>1/2</FR>-in.) ID nozzle. If the sampling train is designed for sampling at higher flow rates than that described in APTD-0581, thus necessitating the use of larger sized nozzles, the free-space shall be 1.9 cm (<FR>3/4</FR>-in.) with the largest sized nozzle in place.</P>

            <P>6.1.4.2 Source-sampling assemblies that do not meet the minimum spacing requirements of Figure 17-1 (or the equivalent of these requirements, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> Figure 2-4 of Method 2) may be used; however, the pitot tube coefficients of such assemblies shall be determined by calibration, using methods subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>6.1.5 Condenser. It is recommended that the impinger system or alternatives described in Method 5 be used to determine the moisture content of the stack gas. Flexible tubing may be used between the probe extension and condenser. Long tubing lengths may affect the moisture determination.</P>
            <P>6.2 Sample Recovery. Probe-liner and probe-nozzle brushes, wash bottles, glass sample storage containers, petri dishes, graduated cylinder and/or balance, plastic storage containers, funnel and rubber policeman, funnel. Same as in Method 5, sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.8, respectively.</P>
            <P>6.3 Sample Analysis. Glass weighing dishes, desiccator, analytical balance, balance, beakers, hygrometer, temperature sensor. Same as in Method 5, sections 6.3.1 through 6.3.7, respectively.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 Pretest Preparation. Same as in Method 5, section 8.1.1.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as in Method 5, section 8.1.2, except as follows: Make a projected-area model of the probe extension-filter holder assembly, with the pitot tube face openings positioned along the centerline of the stack, as shown in Figure 17-2. Calculate the estimated cross-section blockage, as shown in Figure 17-2. If the blockage exceeds 5 percent of the duct cross sectional area, the tester has the following options exist: (1) a suitable out-of-stack filtration method may be used instead of in-stack filtration; or (2) a special in-stack arrangement, in which the sampling and velocity measurement sites are separate, may be used; for details concerning this approach, consult with the Administrator (see also Reference 1 in section 17.0). Select a probe extension length such that all traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack to reduce the length of probes.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as in Method 5, section 8.1.3, except the following: Using a tweezer or clean disposable surgical gloves, place a labeled (identified) and weighed filter in the filter holder. Be sure that the filter is properly centered and the gasket properly placed so as not to allow the sample gas stream to circumvent the filter. Check filter for tears after assembly is completed. Mark the probe extension with heat resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point. Assemble the train as in Figure 17-1, using a very light coat of silicone grease on all ground glass joints and greasing only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) to avoid possibility of contamination by the silicone grease. Place crushed ice around the impingers.</P>
            <P>8.1.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Same as in Method 5, section 8.1.4, except that the filter holder is inserted into the stack during the sampling train leak-check. To do this, plug the inlet to the probe nozzle with a material that will be able to withstand the stack temperature. Insert the filter holder into the stack and wait approximately 5 minutes (or longer, if necessary) to allow the system to come to equilibrium with the temperature of the stack gas stream.</P>

            <P>8.1.5 Sampling Train Operation. The operation is the same as in Method 5. Use a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-3 of Method 5, except that the filter holder temperature is not recorded.<PRTPAGE P="447"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.1.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as in Method 5, section 12.11.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sample Recovery.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe extension assembly is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the assembly to cool.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 When the assembly can be safely handled, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap over it to prevent losing or gaining particulate matter. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling down as this would create a vacuum in the filter holder, forcing condenser water backward.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, disconnect the filter holder-probe nozzle assembly from the probe extension; cap the open inlet of the probe extension. Be careful not to lose any condensate, if present. Remove the umbilical cord from the condenser outlet and cap the outlet. If a flexible line is used between the first impinger (or condenser) and the probe extension, disconnect the line at the probe extension and let any condensed water or liquid drain into the impingers or condenser. Disconnect the probe extension from the condenser; cap the probe extension outlet. After wiping off the silicone grease, cap off the condenser inlet. Ground glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps (whichever are appropriate) may be used to close these openings.</P>
            <P>8.2.4 Transfer both the filter holder-probe nozzle assembly and the condenser to the cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so that the chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be minimized.</P>
            <P>8.2.5 Save a portion of the acetone used for cleanup as a blank. Take 200 ml of this acetone from the wash bottle being used and place it in a glass sample container labeled “acetone blank.” Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and not any abnormal conditions. Treat the sample as discussed in Method 5, section 8.2.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability.</P>

            <P>1.2.1 This method is designed to measure gaseous organics emitted from an industrial source. While designed for ppm level sources, some detectors are quite capable of detecting compounds at ambient levels, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> ECD, ELCD, and helium ionization detectors. Some other types of detectors are evolving such that the sensitivity and applicability may well be in the ppb range in only a few years.</P>
            <P>1.2.2 This method will not determine compounds that (1) are polymeric (high molecular weight), (2) can polymerize before analysis, or (3) have very low vapor pressures at stack or instrument conditions.</P>
            <P>1.3 Range. The lower range of this method is determined by the sampling system; adsorbents may be used to concentrate the sample, thus lowering the limit of detection below the 1 part per million (ppm) typically achievable with direct interface or bag sampling. The upper limit is governed by GC detector saturation or column overloading; the upper range can be extended by dilution of sample with an inert gas or by using smaller volume gas sampling loops. The upper limit can also be governed by condensation of higher boiling compounds.</P>
            <P>1.4 Sensitivity. The sensitivity limit for a compound is defined as the minimum detectable concentration of that compound, or the concentration that produces a signal-to-noise ratio of three to one. The minimum detectable concentration is determined during the presurvey calibration for each compound.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>The major organic components of a gas mixture are separated by gas chromatography (GC) and individually quantified by flame ionization, photoionization, electron capture, or other appropriate detection principles. The retention times of each separated component are compared with those of known compounds under identical conditions. Therefore, the analyst confirms the identity and approximate concentrations of the organic emission components beforehand. With this information, the analyst then prepares or purchases commercially available standard mixtures to calibrate the GC under conditions identical to those of the samples. The analyst also determines the need for sample dilution to avoid detector saturation, gas stream filtration to eliminate particulate matter, and prevention of moisture condensation.</P>

            <P>4.1 Resolution interferences that may occur can be eliminated by appropriate GC column and detector choice or by shifting the retention times through changes in the column flow rate and the use of temperature programming.</P>
            <P>4.2 The analytical system is demonstrated to be essentially free from contaminants by periodically analyzing blanks that consist of hydrocarbon-free air or nitrogen.</P>
            <P>4.3 Sample cross-contamination that occurs when high-level and low-level samples or standards are analyzed alternately is best dealt with by thorough purging of the GC sample loop between samples.</P>
            <P>4.4 To assure consistent detector response, calibration gases are contained in dry air. To adjust gaseous organic concentrations when water vapor is present in the sample, water vapor concentrations are determined for those samples, and a correction factor is applied.</P>

            <P>8.2.1 Integrated Bag Sampling and Analysis.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.1 Evacuated Container Sampling Procedure. In this procedure, the bags are filled by evacuating the rigid air-tight container holding the bags. Use a field sample data sheet as shown in Figure 18-10. Collect triplicate samples from each sample location.</P>

            <P>8.2.1.1.2 Sampling Procedure. To obtain a sample, assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 18-9. Leak-check both the bag and the container. Connect the vacuum line from the needle valve to the Teflon sample line from the probe. Place the end of the probe at the centroid of the stack or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 in., and start the pump. Set the flow rate so that the final volume of the sample is approximately 80 percent of the bag capacity. After allowing sufficient time to purge the line several times, connect the vacuum line to the bag, and evacuate until the rotameter indicates no flow. Then position the sample and vacuum lines for sampling, and begin the actual sampling, keeping the rate proportional to the stack velocity. As a precaution, direct the gas exiting the rotameter away from sampling personnel. At the end of the sample period, shut off the pump, disconnect the sample line from the bag, and disconnect the vacuum line from the bag container. Record the source temperature, barometric pressure, ambient temperature, sampling flow rate, and initial and final sampling time on the data sheet shown in Figure 18-10. Protect the bag and its container from sunlight. Record the time lapsed between sample collection and analysis, and then conduct the recovery procedure in Section 8.4.2.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.2 Direct Pump Sampling Procedure. Follow 8.2.1.1, except place the pump and needle valve between the probe and the bag. Use a pump and needle valve constructed of inert material not affected by the stack gas. Leak-check the system, and then purge with stack gas before connecting to the previously evacuated bag.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.3 Explosion Risk Area Bag Sampling Procedure. Follow 8.2.1.1 except replace the pump with another evacuated can (see Figure 18-9a). Use this method whenever there is a possibility of an explosion due to pumps, heated probes, or other flame producing equipment.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.4 Other Modified Bag Sampling Procedures. In the event that condensation is observed in the bag while collecting the sample and a direct interface system cannot be used, heat the bag during collection and maintain it at a suitably elevated temperature during all subsequent operations. (Note: Take care to leak-check the system prior to the dilutions so as not to create a potentially explosive atmosphere.) As an alternative, collect the sample gas, and simultaneously dilute it in the bag.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.4.1 First Alternative Procedure. Heat the box containing the sample bag to 120 °C (±5 °C). Then transport the bag as rapidly as possible to the analytical area while maintaining the heating, or cover the box with an insulating blanket. In the analytical area, keep the box heated to 120 °C (±5 °C) until analysis. Be sure that the method of heating the box and the control for the heating circuit are compatible with the safety restrictions required in each area.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.4.2 Second Alternative Procedure. Prefill the bag with a known quantity of inert gas. Meter the inert gas into the bag according to the procedure for the preparation of gas concentration standards of volatile liquid materials (Section 10.1.2.2), but eliminate the midget impinger section. Take the partly filled bag to the source, and meter the source gas into the bag through heated sampling lines and a heated flowmeter, or Teflon positive displacement pump. Verify the dilution factors before sampling each bag through dilution and analysis of gases of known concentration.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.5 Analysis of Bag Samples.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.5.1 Apparatus. Same as section 8.1. A minimum of three gas standards are required.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.5.2 Procedure.</P>

            <P>8.2.1.5.2.1 Establish proper GC operating conditions as described in section 10.2, and record all data listed in Figure 18-7. Prepare the GC so that gas can be drawn through the sample valve. Flush the sample loop with <PRTPAGE P="452"/>calibration gas mixture, and activate the valve (sample pressure at the inlet to the GC introduction valve should be similar during calibration as during actual sample analysis). Obtain at least three chromatograms for the mixture. The results are acceptable when the peak areas for the three injections agree to within 5 percent of their average. If they do not agree, run additional samples or correct the analytical techniques until this requirement is met. Then analyze the other two calibration mixtures in the same manner. Prepare a calibration curve as described in section 10.2.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.5.2.2 Analyze the three source gas samples by connecting each bag to the sampling valve with a piece of Teflon tubing identified with that bag. Analyze each bag sample three times. Record the data in Figure 18-11. If certain items do not apply, use the notation “N.A.” If the bag has been maintained at an elevated temperature as described in section 8.2.1.4, determine the stack gas water content by Method 4. After all samples have been analyzed, repeat the analysis of the mid-level calibration gas for each compound. Compare the average response factor of the pre- and post-test analysis for each compound. If they differ by &gt;5percent, analyze the other calibration gas levels for that compound, and prepare a calibration curve using all the pre- and post-test calibration gas mixture values. If the two response factor averages (pre-and post-test) differ by less than 5 percent from their mean value, the tester has the option of using only the pre-test calibration curve to generate the concentration values.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.6 Determination of Bag Water Vapor Content. Measure the ambient temperature and barometric pressure near the bag. From a water saturation vapor pressure table, determine and record the water vapor content of the bag as a decimal figure. (Assume the relative humidity to be 100 percent unless a lesser value is known.) If the bag has been maintained at an elevated temperature as described in section 8.2.1.4, determine the stack gas water content by Method 4.</P>

            <P>8.2.1.8 Emission Calculations. From the calibration curve described in section 8.2.1.5, select the value of C<E T="52">s</E> that corresponds to the peak area.

            <P>8.2.2.2 Procedure. Calibrate the GC using the procedures in section 8.2.1.5.2.1. To obtain a stack gas sample, assemble the sampling system as shown in Figure 18-12. Make sure all connections are tight. Turn on the probe and sample line heaters. As the temperature of the probe and heated line approaches the target temperature as indicated on the thermocouple readout device, control the heating to maintain a temperature greater than 110 °C. Conduct a 3-point calibration of the GC by analyzing each gas mixture in triplicate. Generate a calibration curve. Place the inlet of the probe at the centroid of the duct, or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m, and draw source gas into the probe, heated line, and sample loop. After thorough flushing, analyze the stack gas sample using the same conditions as for <PRTPAGE P="453"/>the calibration gas mixture. For each run, sample, analyze, and record five consecutive samples. A test consists of three runs (five samples per run times three runs, for a total of fifteen samples). After all samples have been analyzed, repeat the analysis of the mid-level calibration gas for each compound. For each calibration standard, compare the pre- and post-test average response factors (RF) for each compound. If the two calibration RF values (pre- and post-analysis) differ by more than 5 percent from their mean value, then analyze the other calibration gas levels for that compound and determine the stack gas sample concentrations by comparison to both calibration curves (this is done by preparing a calibration curve using all the pre- and post-test calibration gas mixture values.) If the two calibration RF values differ by less than 5 percent from their mean value, the tester has the option of using only the pre-test calibration curve to generate the concentration values. Record this calibration data and the other required data on the data sheet shown in Figure 18-11, deleting the dilution gas information.</P>

            <P>8.2.3 Dilution Interface Sampling and Analysis Procedure. Source samples that contain a high concentration of organic materials may require dilution prior to analysis to prevent saturating the GC detector. The apparatus required for this direct interface procedure is basically the same as that described in the section 8.2.2, except a dilution system is added between the heated sample line and the gas sampling valve. The apparatus is arranged so that either a 10:1 or 100:1 dilution of the source gas can be directed to the chromatograph. A pump of larger capacity is also required, and this pump must be heated and placed in the system between the sample line and the dilution apparatus.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1 Apparatus. The equipment required in addition to that specified for the direct interface system is as follows:</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1.1 Sample Pump. Leakless Teflon-coated diaphragm-type that can withstand being heated to 120 °C and deliver 1.5 liters/minute.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1.2 Dilution Pumps. Two Model A-150 Komhyr Teflon positive displacement type delivering 150 cc/minute, or equivalent. As an option, calibrated flowmeters can be used in conjunction with Teflon-coated diaphragm pumps.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1.3 Valves. Two Teflon three-way valves, suitable for connecting to Teflon tubing.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1.4 Flowmeters. Two, for measurement of diluent gas.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1.5 Diluent Gas with Cylinders and Regulators. Gas can be nitrogen or clean dry air, depending on the nature of the source gases.</P>

            <P>8.2.3.1.6 Heated Box. Suitable for being heated to 120 °C, to contain the three pumps, three-way valves, and associated connections. The box should be equipped with quick connect fittings to facilitate connection of: (1) the heated sample line from the probe, (2) the gas sampling valve, (3) the calibration gas mixtures, and (4) diluent gas lines. A schematic diagram of the components and connections is shown in Figure 18-13. The heated box shown in Figure 18-13 is designed to receive a heated line from the probe. An optional design is to build a probe unit that attaches directly to the heated box. In this way, the heated box contains the controls for the probe heaters, or, if the box is placed against the duct being sampled, it may be possible to eliminate the probe heaters. In either case, a heated Teflon line is used to connect the heated box to the gas sampling valve on the chromatograph.

            <P>8.2.3.2 Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.2.1 Assemble the apparatus by connecting the heated box, shown in Figure 18-13, between the heated sample line from the probe and the gas sampling valve on the chromatograph. Vent the source gas from the gas sampling valve directly to the charcoal filter, eliminating the pump and rotameter. Heat the sample probe, sample line, and heated box. Insert the probe and source thermocouple at the centroid of the duct, or to a point no closer to the walls than 1 m. Measure the source temperature, and adjust all heating units to a temperature 0 to 3 °C above this temperature. If this temperature is above the safe operating temperature of the Teflon components, adjust the heating to maintain a temperature high enough to prevent condensation of water and organic compounds (greater than 110 °C). Calibrate the GC through the dilution system by following the procedures in section 8.2.1.5.2.1. Determine the concentration of the diluted calibration gas using the dilution factor and the certified concentration of the calibration gas. Record the pertinent data on the data sheet shown in Figure 18-11.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.2.2 Once the dilution system and GC operations are satisfactory, proceed with the analysis of source gas, maintaining the same dilution settings as used for the standards.</P>

            <P>8.2.3.2.3 Analyze the audit samples using either the dilution system, or directly connect to the gas sampling valve as required. Record all data and report the results to the audit supervisor.<PRTPAGE P="454"/>

            <P>8.2.4 Adsorption Tube Procedure. Any commercially available adsorbent is allowed for the purposes of this method, as long as the recovery study criteria in section 8.4.3 are met. Help in choosing the adsorbent may be found by calling the distributor, or the tester may refer to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) methods for the particular organics to be sampled. For some adsorbents, the principal interferent will be water vapor. If water vapor is thought to be a problem, the tester may place a midget impinger in an ice bath before the adsorbent tubes. If this option is chosen, the water catch in the midget impinger shall be analyzed for the target compounds. Also, the spike for the recovery study (in section 8.4.3) shall be conducted in both the midget impinger and the adsorbent tubes. The combined recovery (add the recovered amount in the impinger and the adsorbent tubes to calculate R) shall then meet the criteria in section 8.4.3.

            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.2.4.1 Additional Apparatus. The following items (or equivalent) are suggested.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1.1 Probe. Borosilicate glass or stainless steel, approximately 6-mm ID, with a heating system if water condensation is a problem, and a filter (either in-stack or out-of-stack, heated to stack temperature) to remove particulate matter. In most instances, a plug of glass wool is a satisfactory filter.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1.2 Flexible Tubing. To connect probe to adsorption tubes. Use a material that exhibits minimal sample adsorption.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1.3 Leakless Sample Pump. Flow controlled, constant rate pump, with a set of limiting (sonic) orifices.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1.4 Bubble-Tube Flowmeter. Volume accuracy within 1 percent, to calibrate pump.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1.5 Stopwatch. To time sampling and pump rate calibration.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1.6 Adsorption Tubes. Precleaned adsorbent, with mass of adsorbent to be determined by calculating breakthrough volume and expected concentration in the stack.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1.7 Barometer. Accurate to 5 mm Hg, to measure atmospheric pressure during sampling and pump calibration.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1.8 Rotameter. O to 100 cc/min, to detect changes in flow rate during sampling.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.2 Sampling and Analysis.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.2.1 Calibrate the pump and limiting orifice flow rate through adsorption tubes with the bubble tube flowmeter before sampling. The sample system can be operated as a “recirculating loop” for this operation. Record the ambient temperature and barometric pressure. Then, during sampling, use the rotameter to verify that the pump and orifice sampling rate remains constant.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.2.2 Use a sample probe, if required, to obtain the sample at the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m. Minimize the length of flexible tubing between the probe and adsorption tubes. Several adsorption tubes can be connected in series, if the extra adsorptive capacity is needed. Adsorption tubes should be maintained vertically during the test in order to prevent channeling. Provide the gas sample to the sample system at a pressure sufficient for the limiting orifice to function as a sonic orifice. Record the total time and sample flow rate (or the number of pump strokes), the barometric pressure, and ambient temperature. Obtain a total sample volume commensurate with the expected concentration(s) of the volatile organic(s) present and recommended sample loading factors (weight sample per weight adsorption media). Laboratory tests prior to actual sampling may be necessary to predetermine this volume. If water vapor is present in the sample at concentrations above 2 to 3 percent, the adsorptive capacity may be severely reduced. Operate the gas chromatograph according to the manufacturer's instructions. After establishing optimum conditions, verify and document these conditions during all operations. Calibrate the instrument and then analyze the emission samples.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.3 Standards and Calibration. If using thermal desorption, obtain calibration gases using the procedures in section 10.1. If using solvent extraction, prepare liquid standards in the desorption solvent. Use a minimum of three different standards; select the concentrations to bracket the expected average sample concentration. Perform the calibration before and after each day's sample analyses using the procedures in section 8.2.1.5.2.1.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.4 Quality Assurance.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.4.1 Determine the recovery efficiency of the pollutants of interest according to section 8.4.3.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.4.2 Determination of Sample Collection Efficiency (Optional). If sample breakthrough is thought to be a problem, a routine procedure for determining breakthrough is to analyze the primary and backup portions of the adsorption tubes separately. If the backup portion exceeds 10 percent of the total amount (primary and back-up), it is usually a sign of sample breakthrough. For the purposes of this method, only the recovery efficiency value (Section 8.4.3) is used to determine the appropriateness of the sampling and analytical procedure.</P>

            <P>8.2.4.4.3 Volume Flow Rate Checks. Perform this check immediately after sampling with all sampling train components in place. <PRTPAGE P="455"/>Use the bubble-tube flowmeter to measure the pump volume flow rate with the orifice used in the test sampling, and record the result. If it has changed by more than 5 but less than 20 percent, calculate an average flow rate for the test. If the flow rate has changed by more than 20 percent, recalibrate the pump and repeat the sampling.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.4.4 Calculations. Correct all sample volumes to standard conditions. If a sample dilution system has been used, multiply the results by the appropriate dilution ratio. Correct all results according to the applicable procedure in section 8.4.3. Report results as ppm by volume, dry basis.</P>
            <P>8.3 Reporting of Results. At the completion of the field analysis portion of the study, ensure that the data sheets shown in Figure 18-11 have been completed. Summarize this data on the data sheets shown in Figure 18-15.</P>
            <P>8.4 Recovery Study. After conducting the presurvey and identifying all of the pollutants of interest, conduct the appropriate recovery study during the test based on the sampling system chosen for the compounds of interest.</P>
            <P>8.4.1 Recovery Study for Direct Interface or Dilution Interface Sampling. If the procedures in section 8.2.2 or 8.2.3 are to be used to analyze the stack gas, conduct the calibration procedure as stated in section 8.2.2.2 or 8.2.3.2, as appropriate. Upon successful completion of the appropriate calibration procedure, attach the mid-level calibration gas for at least one target compound to the inlet of the probe or as close as possible to the inlet of the probe, but before the filter. Repeat the calibration procedure by sampling and analyzing the mid-level calibration gas through the entire sampling and analytical system in triplicate. The mean of the calibration gas response sampled through the probe shall be within 10 percent of the analyzer response. If the difference in the two means is greater than 10 percent, check for leaks throughout the sampling system and repeat the analysis of the standard through the sampling system until this criterion is met.</P>
            <P>8.4.2 Recovery Study for Bag Sampling.</P>
            <P>8.4.2.1 Follow the procedures for the bag sampling and analysis in section 8.2.1. After analyzing all three bag samples, choose one of the bag samples and tag this bag as the spiked bag. Spike the chosen bag sample with a known mixture (gaseous or liquid) of all of the target pollutants. The theoretical concentration, in ppm, of each spiked compound in the bag shall be 40 to 60 percent of the average concentration measured in the three bag samples. If a target compound was not detected in the bag samples, the concentration of that compound to be spiked shall be 5 times the limit of detection for that compound. Store the spiked bag for the same period of time as the bag samples collected in the field. After the appropriate storage time has passed, analyze the spiked bag three times. Calculate the average fraction recovered (R) of each spiked target compound with the equation in section 12.7.</P>
            <P>8.4.2.2 For the bag sampling technique to be considered valid for a compound, 0.70 ≤R ≤1.30. If the R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the sampling technique is not acceptable for that compound, and therefore another sampling technique shall be evaluated for acceptance (by repeating the recovery study with another sampling technique). Report the R value in the test report and correct all field measurements with the calculated R value for that compound by using the equation in section 12.8.</P>
            <P>8.4.3 Recovery Study for Adsorption Tube Sampling. If following the adsorption tube procedure in section 8.2.4, conduct a recovery study of the compounds of interest during the actual field test. Set up two identical sampling trains. Collocate the two sampling probes in the stack. The probes shall be placed in the same horizontal plane, where the first probe tip is 2.5 cm from the outside edge of the other. One of the sampling trains shall be designated the spiked train and the other the unspiked train. Spike all of the compounds of interest (in gaseous or liquid form) onto the adsorbent tube(s) in the spiked train before sampling. The mass of each spiked compound shall be 40 to 60 percent of the mass expected to be collected with the unspiked train. Sample the stack gas into the two trains simultaneously. Analyze the adsorbents from the two trains utilizing identical analytical procedures and instrumentation. Determine the fraction of spiked compound recovered (R) using the equations in section 12.9.</P>
            <P>8.4.3.1 Repeat the procedure in section 8.4.3 twice more, for a total of three runs. In order for the adsorbent tube sampling and analytical procedure to be acceptable for a compound, 0.70≤R≤1.30 (R in this case is the average of three runs). If the average R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the sampling technique is not acceptable for that compound, and therefore another sampling technique shall be evaluated for acceptance (by repeating the recovery study with another sampling technique). Report the R value in the test report and correct all field measurements with the calculated R value for that compound by using the equation in section 12.8.</P>

            <P>10.1 Calibration Standards. Obtain calibration gas standards for each target compound to be analyzed. Commercial cylinder gases certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 1 percent of the certified label value are preferable, although cylinder gases certified by the manufacturer to 2 percent accuracy are allowed. Another option allowed by this method is for the tester to obtain high concentration certified cylinder gases and then use a dilution system meeting the requirements of Test Method 205, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M to make multi-level calibration gas standards. Prepare or obtain enough calibration standards so that there are three different concentrations of each organic compound expected to be measured in the source sample. For each organic compound, select those concentrations that bracket the concentrations expected in the source samples. A calibration standard may contain more than one organic compound. If samples are collected in adsorbent tubes and extracted using solvent extraction, prepare or obtain standards in the same solvent used for the sample extraction procedure. Verify the stability of all standards for the time periods they are used.</P>

            <P>11.1.1.3 Preparation of Presurvey Samples. If the samples were collected on an adsorbent, extract the sample as recommended by the manufacturer for removal of the compounds with a solvent suitable to the type of GC analysis. Prepare other samples in an appropriate manner.</P>
            <P>11.1.1.4 Presurvey Sample Analysis.</P>
            <P>11.1.1.4.1 Before analysis, heat the presurvey sample to the duct temperature to vaporize any condensed material. Analyze the samples by the GC procedure, and compare the retention times against those of the calibration samples that contain the components expected to be in the stream. If any compounds cannot be identified with certainty by this procedure, identify them by other means such as GC/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) or GC/infrared techniques. A GC/MS system is recommended.</P>

            <P>11.1.1.4.2 Use the GC conditions determined by the procedure of section 11.1.1.2 for the first injection. Vary the GC parameters during subsequent injections to determine the optimum settings. Once the optimum settings have been determined, perform repeat injections of the sample to determine the retention time of each compound. To inject a sample, draw sample through the loop at a constant rate (100 ml/min for 30 seconds). Be careful not to pressurize the gas in the loop. Turn off the pump and allow the gas in the sample loop to come to ambient pressure. Activate the sample valve, and record injection time, loop temperature, column temperature, carrier flow rate, chart speed, and attenuator setting. Calculate the retention <PRTPAGE P="457"/>time of each peak using the distance from injection to the peak maximum divided by the chart speed. Retention times should be repeatable within 0.5 seconds.</P>
            <P>11.1.1.4.3 If the concentrations are too high for appropriate detector response, a smaller sample loop or dilutions may be used for gas samples, and, for liquid samples, dilution with solvent is appropriate. Use the standard curves (Section 10.2) to obtain an estimate of the concentrations.</P>
            <P>11.1.1.4.4 Identify all peaks by comparing the known retention times of compounds expected to be in the retention times of peaks in the sample.

            <P>13.1 Since a potential sample may contain a variety of compounds from various sources, a specific precision limit for the analysis of field samples is impractical. Precision in the range of 5 to 10 percent relative standard deviation (RSD) is typical for gas chromatographic techniques, but an experienced GC operator with a reliable instrument can readily achieve 5 percent RSD. For this method, the following combined GC/operator values are required.</P>
            <P>(a) Precision. Triplicate analyses of calibration standards fall within 5 percent of their mean value.</P>
            <P>(b) Recovery. After developing an appropriate sampling and analytical system for the pollutants of interest, conduct the procedure in section 8.4. Conduct the appropriate recovery study in section 8.4 at each sampling point where the method is being applied.

            <P>16.1.3 Sampling.</P>
            <P>16.1.3.1 Collection of Samples with Glass Sampling Flasks. Presurvey samples may be collected in precleaned 250-ml double-ended glass sampling flasks. Teflon stopcocks, without grease, are preferred. Flasks should be cleaned as follows: Remove the stopcocks from both ends of the flasks, and wipe the parts to remove any grease. Clean the stopcocks, barrels, and receivers with methylene chloride (or other non-target pollutant solvent, or heat and humidified air). Clean all glass ports with a soap solution, then rinse with tap and deionized distilled water. Place the flask in a cool glass annealing furnace, and apply heat up to 500 °C. Maintain at this temperature for 1 hour. After this time period, shut off and open the furnace to allow the flask to cool. Return the stopcocks to the flask receivers. Purge the assembly with high-purity nitrogen for 2 to 5 minutes. Close off the stopcocks after purging to maintain a slight positive nitrogen pressure. Secure the stopcocks with tape. Presurvey samples can be obtained either by drawing the gases into the previously evacuated flask or by drawing the gases into and purging the flask with a rubber suction bulb.</P>
            <P>16.1.3.1.1 Evacuated Flask Procedure. Use a high-vacuum pump to evacuate the flask to the capacity of the pump; then close off the stopcock leading to the pump. Attach a 6-mm outside diameter (OD) glass tee to the flask inlet with a short piece of Teflon tubing. Select a 6-mm OD borosilicate sampling probe, enlarged at one end to a 12-mm OD and of sufficient length to reach the centroid of the duct to be sampled. Insert a glass wool plug in the enlarged end of the probe to remove particulate matter. Attach the other end of the probe to the tee with a short piece of Teflon tubing. Connect a rubber suction bulb to the third leg of the tee. Place the filter end of the probe at the centroid of the duct, and purge the probe with the rubber suction bulb. After the probe is completely purged and filled with duct gases, open the stopcock to the grab flask until the pressure in the flask reaches duct pressure. Close off the stopcock, and remove the probe from the duct. Remove the tee from the flask and tape the stopcocks to prevent leaks during shipment. Measure and record the duct temperature and pressure.</P>
            <P>16.1.3.1.2 Purged Flask Procedure. Attach one end of the sampling flask to a rubber suction bulb. Attach the other end to a 6-mm OD glass probe as described in section 8.3.3.1.1. Place the filter end of the probe at the centroid of the duct, or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m, and apply suction with the bulb to completely purge the probe and flask. After the flask has been purged, close off the stopcock near the suction bulb, and then close off the stopcock near the probe. Remove the probe from the duct, and disconnect both the probe and suction bulb. Tape the stopcocks to prevent leakage during shipment. Measure and record the duct temperature and pressure.</P>
            <P>16.1.3.2 Flexible Bag Procedure. Any leak-free plastic (e.g., Tedlar, Mylar, Teflon) or plastic-coated aluminum (e.g., aluminized Mylar) bag, or equivalent, can be used to obtain the pre-survey sample. Use new bags, and leak-check them before field use. In addition, check the bag before use for contamination by filling it with nitrogen or air and analyzing the gas by GC at high sensitivity. Experience indicates that it is desirable to allow the inert gas to remain in the bag about 24 hours or longer to check for desorption of organics from the bag. Follow the leak-check and sample collection procedures given in Section 8.2.1.</P>
            <P>16.1.3.3 Determination of Moisture Content. For combustion or water-controlled processes, obtain the moisture content from plant personnel or by measurement during the presurvey. If the source is below 59 °C, measure the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures, and calculate the moisture content using a psychrometric chart. At higher temperatures, use Method 4 to determine the moisture content.</P>
            <P>16.1.4 Determination of Static Pressure. Obtain the static pressure from the plant personnel or measurement. If a type S pitot tube and an inclined manometer are used, take care to align the pitot tube 90° from the direction of the flow. Disconnect one of the tubes to the manometer, and read the static pressure; note whether the reading is positive or negative.</P>
            <P>16.1.5 Collection of Presurvey Samples with Adsorption Tube. Follow section 8.2.4 for presurvey sampling.</P>

If the flowmeter being calibrated is a rotameter or other flow device that is viscosity dependent, it may be necessary to generate a “family” of calibration curves that cover the operating pressure and temperature ranges of the flowmeter. While the following technique should be verified before application, it may be possible to calculate flow rate reading for rotameters at standard conditions Q<E T="52">std</E> as follows:</TNOTE>

            <P>The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.</P>
            <P>Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.</P>
            <P>Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.</P>
            <P>The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.</P>
            <P>Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.</P>
            <P>Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. Where specified by an applicable subpart of the regulations, this method is applicable for the determination of (a) PM, SO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates; (b) sulfur removal efficiencies of fuel pretreatment and SO<E T="52">2</E> control devices; and (c) overall reduction of potential SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>2.1 Emission Rates. Oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>) or carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) concentrations and appropriate F factors (ratios of combustion gas volumes to heat inputs) are used to calculate pollutant emission rates from pollutant concentrations.</P>
            <P>2.2 Sulfur Reduction Efficiency and SO<E T="52">2</E> Removal Efficiency. An overall SO<E T="52">2</E> emission reduction efficiency is computed from the efficiency of fuel pretreatment systems, where applicable, and the efficiency of SO<E T="52">2</E> control devices.</P>
            <P>2.2.1 The sulfur removal efficiency of a fuel pretreatment system is determined by fuel sampling and analysis of the sulfur and heat contents of the fuel before and after the pretreatment system.</P>
            <P>2.2.2 The SO<E T="52">2</E> removal efficiency of a control device is determined by measuring the SO<E T="52">2</E> rates before and after the control device.</P>
            <P>2.2.2.1 The inlet rates to SO<E T="52">2</E> control systems (or, when SO<E T="52">2</E> control systems are not used, SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rates to the atmosphere) are determined by fuel sampling and analysis.</P>

As used in this method, systematic spacing is intended to include evenly spaced increments in time or increments based on equal weights of coal passing the collection area. As a minimum, determine the number and weight of increments required per gross sample representing each coal lot according to Table 2 or Paragraph 7.1.5.2 of ASTM D 2234. Collect one gross sample for each lot of raw coal and one gross sample for each lot of product coal.</P>

            <P>12.5.2.1.2 ASTM Lot Size. For the purpose of section 12.5.2 (fuel pretreatment), the lot size of product coal is the weight of product coal from one type of raw coal. The lot size of raw coal is the weight of raw coal used to produce one lot of product coal. Typically, the lot size is the weight of coal processed in a 1-day (24-hour) period. If more than one type of coal is treated and produced in 1 day, then gross samples must be collected and analyzed for each type of coal. A coal lot size equaling the 90-day quarterly fuel quantity for a steam generating unit may be used if representative sampling can be conducted for each raw coal and product coal.

            <P>12.5.3.2.2 Collect the fuel samples from a location in the fuel handling system that provides a sample representative of the fuel bunkered or consumed during a steam generating unit operating day. For the purpose of as-fired fuel sampling under section 12.5.3.2 or section 12.6, the lot size for coal is the weight of coal bunkered or consumed during each steam generating unit operating day. The lot size for oil is the weight of oil supplied to the “day” tank or consumed during each steam generating unit operating day. For reporting and calculation purposes, the gross sample shall be identified with the calendar day on which sampling began. For steam generating unit operating days when a coal-fired steam generating unit is operated without coal being added to the bunkers, the coal analysis from the previous “as bunkered” coal sample shall be used until coal is bunkered again. For steam generating unit operating days when an oil-fired steam generating unit is operated without oil being added to the oil “day” tank, the oil analysis from the previous day shall be used until the “day” tank is filled again. Alternative definitions of fuel lot size may be used, subject to prior approval of the Administrator.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>2.1 A portable instrument is used to detect VOC leaks from individual sources. The instrument detector type is not specified, but it must meet the specifications and performance criteria contained in section 6.0. A leak definition concentration based on a reference compound is specified in each applicable regulation. This method is intended to locate and classify leaks only, and is not to be used as a direct measure of mass emission rate from individual sources.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions</HD>
            <P>3.1 <E T="03">Calibration gas</E> means the VOC compound used to adjust the instrument meter reading to a known value. The calibration gas is usually the reference compound at a known concentration approximately equal to the leak definition concentration.</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Calibration precision</E> means the degree of agreement between measurements of the same known value, expressed as the relative percentage of the average difference between the meter readings and the known concentration to the known concentration.</P>
            <P>3.3 <E T="03">Leak definition concentration</E> means the local VOC concentration at the surface of a leak source that indicates that a VOC emission (leak) is present. The leak definition is an instrument meter reading based on a reference compound.</P>
            <P>3.4 <E T="03">No detectable emission</E> means a local VOC concentration at the surface of a leak source, adjusted for local VOC ambient concentration, that is less than 2.5 percent of the specified leak definition concentration. that indicates that a VOC emission (leak) is not present.</P>
            <P>3.5 <E T="03">Reference compound</E> means the VOC species selected as the instrument calibration basis for specification of the leak definition concentration. (For example, if a leak definition concentration is 10,000 ppm as methane, then any source emission that results in a local concentration that yields a meter reading of 10,000 on an instrument meter calibrated with methane would be classified as a leak. In this example, the leak definition concentration is 10,000 ppm and the reference compound is methane.)</P>

            <P>5.2 Hazardous Pollutants. Several of the compounds, leaks of which may be determined by this method, may be irritating or corrosive to tissues (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> heptane) or may be toxic (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> benzene, methyl alcohol).

The nominal sample flow rate, as measured at the sample probe tip, shall be 0.10 to 3.0 l/min (0.004 to 0.1 ft<SU>3</SU>/min) when the probe is fitted with a glass wool plug or filter that may be used to prevent plugging of the instrument.</P>

            <P>6.5 The instrument shall be equipped with a probe or probe extension or sampling not to exceed 6.4 mm (<FR>1/4</FR> in) in outside diameter, <PRTPAGE P="484"/>with a single end opening for admission of sample.</P>
            <P>6.6 The instrument shall be intrinsically safe for operation in explosive atmospheres as defined by the National Electrical Code by the National Fire Prevention Association or other applicable regulatory code for operation in any explosive atmospheres that may be encountered in its use.

The instrument shall not be operated with any safety device, such as an exhaust flame arrestor, removed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>
            <P>7.1 Two gas mixtures are required for instrument calibration and performance evaluation:</P>
            <P>7.1.1 Zero Gas. Air, less than 10 parts per million by volume (ppmv) VOC.</P>
            <P>7.1.2 Calibration Gas. For each organic species that is to be measured during individual source surveys, obtain or prepare a known standard in air at a concentration approximately equal to the applicable leak definition specified in the regulation.</P>
            <P>7.2 Cylinder Gases. If cylinder calibration gas mixtures are used, they must be analyzed and certified by the manufacturer to be within 2 percent accuracy, and a shelf life must be specified. Cylinder standards must be either reanalyzed or replaced at the end of the specified shelf life.</P>
            <P>7.3 Prepared Gases. Calibration gases may be prepared by the user according to any accepted gaseous preparation procedure that will yield a mixture accurate to within 2 percent. Prepared standards must be replaced each day of use unless it is demonstrated that degradation does not occur during storage.</P>
            <P>7.4 Mixtures with non-Reference Compound Gases. Calibrations may be performed using a compound other than the reference compound. In this case, a conversion factor must be determined for the alternative compound such that the resulting meter readings during source surveys can be converted to reference compound results.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</HD>
            <P>8.1 Instrument Performance Evaluation. Assemble and start up the instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions for recommended warmup period and preliminary adjustments.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Response Factor. A response factor must be determined for each compound that is to be measured, either by testing or from reference sources. The response factor tests are required before placing the analyzer into service, but do not have to be repeated at subsequent intervals.</P>
            <P>8.1.1.1 Calibrate the instrument with the reference compound as specified in the applicable regulation. Introduce the calibration gas mixture to the analyzer and record the observed meter reading. Introduce zero gas until a stable reading is obtained. Make a total of three measurements by alternating between the calibration gas and zero gas. Calculate the response factor for each repetition and the average response factor.</P>
            <P>8.1.1.2 The instrument response factors for each of the individual VOC to be measured shall be less than 10 unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulation. When no instrument is available that meets this specification when calibrated with the reference VOC specified in the applicable regulation, the available instrument may be calibrated with one of the VOC to be measured, or any other VOC, so long as the instrument then has a response factor of less than 10 for each of the individual VOC to be measured.</P>
            <P>8.1.1.3 Alternatively, if response factors have been published for the compounds of interest for the instrument or detector type, the response factor determination is not required, and existing results may be referenced. Examples of published response factors for flame ionization and catalytic oxidation detectors are included in References 1-3 of section 17.0.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Calibration Precision. The calibration precision test must be completed prior to placing the analyzer into service and at subsequent 3-month intervals or at the next use, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>8.1.2.1 Make a total of three measurements by alternately using zero gas and the specified calibration gas. Record the meter readings. Calculate the average algebraic difference between the meter readings and the known value. Divide this average difference by the known calibration value and multiply by 100 to express the resulting calibration precision as a percentage.</P>
            <P>8.1.2.2 The calibration precision shall be equal to or less than 10 percent of the calibration gas value.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Response Time. The response time test is required before placing the instrument into service. If a modification to the sample pumping system or flow configuration is made that would change the response time, a new test is required before further use.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.1 Introduce zero gas into the instrument sample probe. When the meter reading has stabilized, switch quickly to the specified calibration gas. After switching, measure the time required to attain 90 percent of the final stable reading. Perform this test sequence three times and record the results. Calculate the average response time.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.2 The instrument response time shall be equal to or less than 30 seconds. The instrument pump, dilution probe (if any), sample probe, and probe filter that will be used <PRTPAGE P="485"/>during testing shall all be in place during the response time determination.</P>
            <P>8.2 Instrument Calibration. Calibrate the VOC monitoring instrument according to section 10.0.</P>
            <P>8.3 Individual Source Surveys.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Type I—Leak Definition Based on Concentration. Place the probe inlet at the surface of the component interface where leakage could occur. Move the probe along the interface periphery while observing the instrument readout. If an increased meter reading is observed, slowly sample the interface where leakage is indicated until the maximum meter reading is obtained. Leave the probe inlet at this maximum reading location for approximately two times the instrument response time. If the maximum observed meter reading is greater than the leak definition in the applicable regulation, record and report the results as specified in the regulation reporting requirements. Examples of the application of this general technique to specific equipment types are:</P>
            <P>8.3.1.1 Valves. The most common source of leaks from valves is the seal between the stem and housing. Place the probe at the interface where the stem exits the packing gland and sample the stem circumference. Also, place the probe at the interface of the packing gland take-up flange seat and sample the periphery. In addition, survey valve housings of multipart assembly at the surface of all interfaces where a leak could occur.</P>
            <P>8.3.1.2 Flanges and Other Connections. For welded flanges, place the probe at the outer edge of the flange-gasket interface and sample the circumference of the flange. Sample other types of nonpermanent joints (such as threaded connections) with a similar traverse.</P>
            <P>8.3.1.3 Pumps and Compressors. Conduct a circumferential traverse at the outer surface of the pump or compressor shaft and seal interface. If the source is a rotating shaft, position the probe inlet within 1 cm of the shaft-seal interface for the survey. If the housing configuration prevents a complete traverse of the shaft periphery, sample all accessible portions. Sample all other joints on the pump or compressor housing where leakage could occur.</P>
            <P>8.3.1.4 Pressure Relief Devices. The configuration of most pressure relief devices prevents sampling at the sealing seat interface. For those devices equipped with an enclosed extension, or horn, place the probe inlet at approximately the center of the exhaust area to the atmosphere.</P>
            <P>8.3.1.5 Process Drains. For open drains, place the probe inlet at approximately the center of the area open to the atmosphere. For covered drains, place the probe at the surface of the cover interface and conduct a peripheral traverse.</P>
            <P>8.3.1.6 Open-ended Lines or Valves. Place the probe inlet at approximately the center of the opening to the atmosphere.</P>
            <P>8.3.1.7 Seal System Degassing Vents and Accumulator Vents. Place the probe inlet at approximately the center of the opening to the atmosphere.</P>
            <P>8.3.1.8 Access door seals. Place the probe inlet at the surface of the door seal interface and conduct a peripheral traverse.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Type II—“No Detectable Emission”. Determine the local ambient VOC concentration around the source by moving the probe randomly upwind and downwind at a distance of one to two meters from the source. If an interference exists with this determination due to a nearby emission or leak, the local ambient concentration may be determined at distances closer to the source, but in no case shall the distance be less than 25 centimeters. Then move the probe inlet to the surface of the source and determine the concentration as outlined in section 8.3.1. The difference between these concentrations determines whether there are no detectable emissions. Record and report the results as specified by the regulation. For those cases where the regulation requires a specific device installation, or that specified vents be ducted or piped to a control device, the existence of these conditions shall be visually confirmed. When the regulation also requires that no detectable emissions exist, visual observations and sampling surveys are required. Examples of this technique are:</P>
            <P>8.3.2.1 Pump or Compressor Seals. If applicable, determine the type of shaft seal. Perform a survey of the local area ambient VOC concentration and determine if detectable emissions exist as described in section 8.3.2.</P>
            <P>8.3.2.2 Seal System Degassing Vents, Accumulator Vessel Vents, Pressure Relief Devices. If applicable, observe whether or not the applicable ducting or piping exists. Also, determine if any sources exist in the ducting or piping where emissions could occur upstream of the control device. If the required ducting or piping exists and there are no sources where the emissions could be vented to the atmosphere upstream of the control device, then it is presumed that no detectable emissions are present. If there are sources in the ducting or piping where emissions could be vented or sources where leaks could occur, the sampling surveys described in section 8.3.2 shall be used to determine if detectable emissions exist.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 Alternative Screening Procedure.</P>

            <P>8.3.3.1 A screening procedure based on the formation of bubbles in a soap solution that is sprayed on a potential leak source may be used for those sources that do not have continuously moving parts, that do not have surface temperatures greater than the boiling point or less than the freezing point of the soap solution, that do not have open <PRTPAGE P="486"/>areas to the atmosphere that the soap solution cannot bridge, or that do not exhibit evidence of liquid leakage. Sources that have these conditions present must be surveyed using the instrument technique of section 8.3.1 or 8.3.2.</P>
            <P>8.3.3.2 Spray a soap solution over all potential leak sources. The soap solution may be a commercially available leak detection solution or may be prepared using concentrated detergent and water. A pressure sprayer or squeeze bottle may be used to dispense the solution. Observe the potential leak sites to determine if any bubbles are formed. If no bubbles are observed, the source is presumed to have no detectable emissions or leaks as applicable. If any bubbles are observed, the instrument techniques of section 8.3.1 or 8.3.2 shall be used to determine if a leak exists, or if the source has detectable emissions, as applicable.</P>

            <P>2.1 Fugitive emissions produced during material processing, handling, and transfer operations or smoke emissions from flares are visually determined by an observer without the aid of instruments.</P>
            <P>2.2 This method is used also to determine visible smoke emissions from flares used for combustion of waste process materials.</P>

            <P>2.3 This method determines the amount of time that visible emissions occur during the observation period (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the accumulated emission time). This method does not require that the opacity of emissions be determined. Since this procedure requires only the determination of whether visible emissions occur and does not require the determination of opacity levels, observer certification according to the procedures of Method 9 is not required. However, it is necessary that the observer is knowledgeable with respect to the general procedures for determining the presence of visible emissions. At a minimum, the observer must be trained and knowledgeable regarding the effects of background contrast, ambient lighting, observer position relative <PRTPAGE P="487"/>to lighting, wind, and the presence of uncombined water (condensing water vapor) on the visibility of emissions. This training is to be obtained from written materials found in References 1 and 2 or from the lecture portion of the Method 9 certification course.</P>

            <P>11.1 Selection of Observation Location. Survey the affected facility, or the building or structure housing the process to be observed, and determine the locations of potential emissions. If the affected facility is located inside a building, determine an observation location that is consistent with the requirements of the applicable regulation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> outside observation of emissions escaping the building/structure or inside observation of emissions directly emitted from the affected facility process unit). Then select a position that enables a clear view of the potential emission point(s) of the affected facility or of the building or structure housing the affected facility, as appropriate for the applicable subpart. A position at least 4.6 m (15 feet), but not more than 400 m (0.25 miles), from the emission source is recommended. For outdoor locations, select a position where the sunlight is not shining directly in the observer's eyes.</P>
            <P>11.2 Field Records.</P>
            <P>11.2.1 Outdoor Location. Record the following information on the field data sheet (Figure 22-1): Company name, industry, process unit, observer's name, observer's affiliation, and date. Record also the estimated wind speed, wind direction, and sky condition. Sketch the process unit being observed, and note the observer location relative to the source and the sun. Indicate the potential and actual emission points on the sketch. Alternatively, digital photography as described in section 11.2.3 may be used for a subset of the recordkeeping requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>11.2.2 Indoor Location. Record the following information on the field data sheet (Figure 22-2): Company name, industry, process unit, observer's name, observer's affiliation, and date. Record as appropriate the type, location, and intensity of lighting on the data sheet. Sketch the process unit being observed, and note the observer location relative to the source. Indicate the potential and actual fugitive emission points on the sketch. Alternatively, digital photography as described in section 11.2.3 may be used for a subset of the recordkeeping requirements of this section.</P>

            <P>11.2.3 Digital Photographic Records. Digital photographs, annotated or unaltered, may be used to record and report sky conditions, observer's location relative to the source, observer's location relative to the <PRTPAGE P="488"/>sun, process unit being observed, potential emission points and actual emission points for the requirements in sections 11.2.1 and 11.2.2. The image must have the proper lighting, field of view and depth of field to properly distinguish the sky condition (if applicable), process unit, potential emission point and actual emission point. At least one digital photograph must be from the point of the view of the observer. The photograph(s) representing the environmental conditions including the sky conditions and the position of the sun relative to the observer and the emission point must be taken within a reasonable time of the observation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 15 minutes). When observations are taken from exactly the same observation point on a routine basis (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> daily) and as long as there are no modifications to the units depicted, only a single photograph each is necessary to document the observer's location relative to the emissions source, the process unit being observed, and the location of potential and actual emission points. Any photographs altered or annotated must be retained in an unaltered format for recordkeeping purposes.</P>
            <P>11.3 Indoor Lighting Requirements. For indoor locations, use a light meter to measure the level of illumination at a location as close to the emission source(s) as is feasible. An illumination of greater than 100 lux (10 foot candles) is considered necessary for proper application of this method.</P>
            <P>11.4 Observations.</P>

            <P>11.4.1 Procedure. Record the clock time when observations begin. Use one stopwatch to monitor the duration of the observation period. Start this stopwatch when the observation period begins. If the observation period is divided into two or more segments by process shutdowns or observer rest breaks (see section 11.4.3), stop the stopwatch when a break begins and restart the stopwatch without resetting it when the break ends. Stop the stopwatch at the end of the observation period. The accumulated time indicated by this stopwatch is the duration of observation period. When the observation period is completed, record the clock time. During the observation period, continuously watch the emission source. Upon observing an emission (condensed water vapor is not considered an emission), start the second accumulative stopwatch; stop the watch when the emission stops. Continue this procedure for the entire observation period. The accumulated elapsed time on this stopwatch is the total time emissions were visible during the observation period (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the emission time.)</P>
            <P>11.4.2 Observation Period. Choose an observation period of sufficient length to meet the requirements for determining compliance with the emission standard in the applicable subpart of the regulations. When the length of the observation period is specifically stated in the applicable subpart, it may not be necessary to observe the source for this entire period if the emission time required to indicate noncompliance (based on the specified observation period) is observed in a shorter time period. In other words, if the regulation prohibits emissions for more than 6 minutes in any hour, then observations may (optional) be stopped after an emission time of 6 minutes is exceeded. Similarly, when the regulation is expressed as an emission frequency and the regulation prohibits emissions for greater than 10 percent of the time in any hour, then observations may (optional) be terminated after 6 minutes of emission are observed since 6 minutes is 10 percent of an hour. In any case, the observation period shall not be less than 6 minutes in duration. In some cases, the process operation may be intermittent or cyclic. In such cases, it may be convenient for the observation period to coincide with the length of the process cycle.</P>
            <P>11.4.3 Observer Rest Breaks. Do not observe emissions continuously for a period of more than 15 to 20 minutes without taking a rest break. For sources requiring observation periods of greater than 20 minutes, the observer shall take a break of not less than 5 minutes and not more than 10 minutes after every 15 to 20 minutes of observation. If continuous observations are desired for extended time periods, two observers can alternate between making observations and taking breaks.</P>
            <P>11.5 Recording Observations. Record the accumulated time of the observation period on the data sheet as the observation period duration. Record the accumulated time emissions were observed on the data sheet as the emission time. Record the clock time the observation period began and ended, as well as the clock time any observer breaks began and ended.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations</HD>
            <P>If the applicable subpart requires that the emission rate be expressed as an emission frequency (in percent), determine this value as follows: Divide the accumulated emission time (in seconds) by the duration of the observation period (in seconds) or by any minimum observation period required in the applicable subpart, if the actual observation period is less than the required period, and multiply this quotient by 100.</P>

            <P>3.1.2.2.1 Drying Column. Pyrex pipe, 10.2 cm ID by 0.6 m long, with suitable retainers.</P>
            <P>3.1.2.2.2 Procedure. The adsorbent must be dried with clean inert gas. Liquid nitrogen from a standard commercial liquid nitrogen cylinder has proven to be a reliable source of large volumes of gas free from organic contaminants. Connect the liquid nitrogen cylinder to the column by a length of cleaned copper tubing, 0.95 cm ID, coiled to pass through a heat source. A convenient heat source is a water-bath heated from a steam line. The final nitrogen temperature should only be warm to the touch and not over 40 °C. Continue flowing nitrogen through the adsorbent until all the residual solvent is removed. The flow rate should be sufficient to gently agitate the particles but not so excessive as the cause the particles to fracture.</P>
            <P>3.1.2.3 Quality Control Check. The adsorbent must be checked for residual toluene.</P>

            <P>3.1.2.3.1 Extraction. Weigh 1.0 g sample of dried resin into a small vial, add 3 ml of toluene, cap the vial, and shake it well.<PRTPAGE P="495"/>
            </P>

            <P>3.1.2.3.2 Analysis. Inject a 2 µl sample of the extract into a gas chromatograph operated under the following conditions:

            <P>Compare the results of the analysis to the results from the reference solution. Prepare the reference solution by injection 2.5 µl of methylene chloride into 100 ml of toluene. This corresponds to 100 µg of methylene chloride per g of adsorbent. The maximum acceptable concentration is 1000 µg/g of adsorbent. If the adsorbent exceeds this level, drying must be continued until the excess methylene chloride is removed.</P>
            <P>3.1.2.4 Storage. The adsorbent must be used within 4 weeks of cleaning. After cleaning, it may be stored in a wide mouth amber glass container with a Teflon-lined cap or placed in one of the glass adsorbent modules tightly sealed with glass stoppers.

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Procedure</HD>
            <P>4.1 Sampling. The complexity of this method is such that, in order to obtain reliable results, testers should be trained and experienced with the test procedures.</P>
            <P>4.1.1 Pretest Preparation.</P>
            <P>4.1.1.1 Cleaning Glassware. All glass components of the train upstream of and including the adsorbent module, shall be cleaned as described in section 3A of the “Manual of Analytical Methods for the Analysis of Pesticides in Human and Environmental Samples.” Special care shall be devoted to the removal of residual silicone grease sealants on ground glass connections of used glassware. Any residue shall be removed by soaking the glassware for several hours in a chromic acid cleaning solution prior to cleaning as described above.</P>
            <P>4.1.1.2 Adsorbent Trap. The traps must be loaded in a clean area to avoid contamination. They may not be loaded in the field. Fill a trap with 20 to 40 g of XAD-2. Follow the XAD-2 with glass wool and tightly cap both ends of the trap. Add 100 µl of the surrogate standard solution (section 3.3.21) to each trap.</P>
            <P>4.1.1.3 Sample Train. It is suggested that all components be maintained according to the procedure described in APTD-0576. Alternative mercury-free thermometers may be used if the thermometers are, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.</P>
            <P>4.1.1.4 Silica Gel. Weigh several 200 to 300 g portions of silica gel in an air tight container to the nearest 0.5 g. Record the total weight of the silica gel plus container, on each container. As an alternative, the silica gel may be weighed directly in its impinger or sampling holder just prior to sampling.</P>
            <P>4.1.1.5 Filter. Check each filter against light for irregularities and flaws or pinhole leaks. Pack the filters flat in a clean glass container.</P>
            <P>4.1.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as section 4.1.2 of Method 5.</P>
            <P>4.1.3 Preparation of Collection Train.</P>

            <P>4.1.3.1 During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep all train openings where contamination can enter, sealed until just prior to assembly or until sampling is about to begin.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Do not use sealant grease in assembling the train.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>4.1.3.2 Place approximately 100 ml of water in the second and third impingers, leave the first and fourth impingers empty, and transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of preweighed silica gel from its container to the fifth impinger.</P>
            <P>4.1.3.3 Place the silica gel container in a clean place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of the silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and recorded.</P>
            <P>4.1.3.4 Assemble the train as shown in Figure 23-1.</P>
            <P>4.1.3.5 Turn on the adsorbent module and condenser coil recirculating pump and begin monitoring the adsorbent module gas entry temperature. Ensure proper sorbent temperature gas entry temperature before proceeding and before sampling is initiated. It is extremely important that the XAD-2 adsorbent resin temperature never exceed 50 °C because thermal decomposition will occur. During testing, the XAD-2 temperature must not exceed 20 °C for efficient capture of the PCDD's and PCDF's.</P>
            <P>4.1.4 Leak-Check Procedure. Same as Method 5, section 4.1.4.</P>
            <P>4.1.5 Sample Train Operation. Same as Method 5, section 4.1.5.</P>
            <P>4.2 Sample Recovery. Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Seal the nozzle end of the sampling probe with Teflon tape or aluminum foil.</P>
            <P>When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe. Remove the probe from the train and close off both ends with aluminum foil. Seal off the inlet to the train with Teflon tape, a ground glass cap, or aluminum foil.</P>
            <P>Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This area shall be clean and enclosed so that the chances of losing or contaminating the sample are minimized. Smoking, which could contaminate the sample, shall not be allowed in the cleanup area.</P>
            <P>Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and note any abnormal conditions, e.g., broken filters, colored impinger liquid, etc. Treat the samples as follows:</P>
            <P>4.2.1 Container No. 1. Either seal the filter holder or carefully remove the filter from the filter holder and place it in its identified container. Use a pair of cleaned tweezers to handle the filter. If it is necessary to fold the filter, do so such that the particulate cake is inside the fold. Carefully transfer to the container any particulate matter and filter fibers which adhere to the filter holder gasket, by using a dry inert bristle brush and a sharp-edged blade. Seal the container.</P>
            <P>4.2.2 Adsorbent Module. Remove the module from the train, tightly cap both ends, label it, cover with aluminum foil, and store it on ice for transport to the laboratory.</P>

            <P>4.2.3 Container No. 2. Quantitatively recover material deposited in the nozzle, probe transfer lines, the front half of the filter holder, and the cyclone, if used, first, by <PRTPAGE P="497"/>brushing while rinsing three times each with acetone and then, by rinsing the probe three times with methylene chloride. Collect all the rinses in Container No. 2.</P>
            <P>Rinse the back half of the filter holder three times with acetone. Rinse the connecting line between the filter and the condenser three times with acetone. Soak the connecting line with three separate portions of methylene chloride for 5 minutes each. If using a separate condenser and adsorbent trap, rinse the condenser in the same manner as the connecting line. Collect all the rinses in Container No. 2 and mark the level of the liquid on the container.</P>
            <P>4.2.4 Container No. 3. Repeat the methylene chloride-rinsing described in section 4.2.3 using toluene as the rinse solvent. Collect the rinses in Container No. 3 and mark the level of the liquid on the container.</P>
            <P>4.2.5 Impinger Water. Measure the liquid in the first three impingers to within ±1 ml by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to within ±0.5 g by using a balance. Record the volume or weight of liquid present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas.</P>
            <P>Discard the liquid after measuring and recording the volume or weight.</P>
            <P>4.2.7 Silica Gel. Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine if it has been completely spent and make a mention of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fifth impinger to its original container and seal. If a moisture determination is made, follow the applicable procedures in sections 8.7.6.3 and 11.2.3 of Method 5 to handle and weigh the silica gel. If moisture is not measured, the silica gel may be disposed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Analysis</HD>
            <P>All glassware shall be cleaned as described in section 3A of the “Manual of Analytical Methods for the Analysis of Pesticides in Human and Environmental Samples.” All samples must be extracted within 30 days of collection and analyzed within 45 days of extraction.</P>
            <P>5.1 Sample Extraction.</P>
            <P>5.1.1 Extraction System. Place an extraction thimble (section 2.3.4), 1 g of silica gel, and a plug of glass wool into the Soxhlet apparatus, charge the apparatus with toluene, and reflux for a minimum of 3 hours. Remove the toluene and discard it, but retain the silica gel. Remove the extraction thimble from the extraction system and place it in a glass beaker to catch the solvent rinses.</P>
            <P>5.1.2 Container No. 1 (Filter). Transfer the contents directly to the glass thimble of the extraction system and extract them simultaneously with the XAD-2 resin.</P>
            <P>5.1.3 Adsorbent Cartridge. Suspend the adsorbent module directly over the extraction thimble in the beaker (See section 5.1.1). The glass frit of the module should be in the up position. Using a Teflon squeeze bottle containing toluene, flush the XAD-2 into the thimble onto the bed of cleaned silica gel. Thoroughly rinse the glass module catching the rinsings in the beaker containing the thimble. If the resin is wet, effective extraction can be accomplished by loosely packing the resin in the thimble. Add the XAD-2 glass wool plug into the thimble.</P>
            <P>5.1.4 Container No. 2 (Acetone and Methylene Chloride). Concentrate the sample to a volume of about 1-5 ml using the rotary evaporator apparatus, at a temperature of less than 37 °C. Rinse the sample container three times with small portions of methylene chloride and add these to the concentrated solution and concentrate further to near dryness. This residue contains particulate matter removed in the rinse of the train probe and nozzle. Add the concentrate to the filter and the XAD-2 resin in the Soxhlet apparatus described in section 5.1.1.</P>
            <P>5.1.5 Extraction. Add 100 µl of the internal standard solution (Section 3.3.20) to the extraction thimble containing the contents of the adsorbent cartridge, the contents of Container No. 1, and the concentrate from section 5.1.4. Cover the contents of the extraction thimble with the cleaned glass wool plug to prevent the XAD-2 resin from floating into the solvent reservoir of the extractor. Place the thimble in the extractor, and add the toluene contained in the beaker to the solvent reservoir. Pour additional toluene to fill the reservoir approximately <FR>2/3</FR> full. Add Teflon boiling chips and assemble the apparatus. Adjust the heat source to cause the extractor to cycle three times per hour. Extract the sample for 16 hours. After extraction, allow the Soxhlet to cool. Transfer the toluene extract and three 10-ml rinses to the rotary evaporator. Concentrate the extract to approximately 10 ml. At this point the analyst may choose to split the sample in half. If so, split the sample, store one half for future use, and analyze the other according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. In either case, use a nitrogen evaporative concentrator to reduce the volume of the sample being analyzed to near dryness. Dissolve the residue in 5 ml of hexane.</P>
            <P>5.1.6 Container No. 3 (Toluene Rinse). Add 100 µl of the Internal Standard solution (section 3.3.2) to the contents of the container. Concentrate the sample to a volume of about 1-5 ml using the rotary evaporator apparatus at a temperature of less than 37 °C. Rinse the sample container apparatus at a temperature of less than 37 °C. Rinse the sample container three times with small portions of toluene and add these to the concentrated solution and concentrate further to near dryness. Analyze the extract separately according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3, but concentrate the solution in a rotary evaporator apparatus rather than a nitrogen evaporative concentrator.</P>

            </P>
            <P>5.2.1 Silica Gel Column. Pack one end of a glass column, 20 mm × 230 mm, with glass wool. Add in sequence, 1 g silica gel, 2 g of sodium hydroxide impregnated silica gel, 1 g silica gel, 4 g of acid-modified silica gel, and 1 g of silica gel. Wash the column with 30 ml of hexane and discard it. Add the sample extract, dissolved in 5 ml of hexane to the column with two additional 5-ml rinses. Elute the column with an additional 90 ml of hexane and retain the entire eluate. Concentrate this solution to a volume of about 1 ml using the nitrogen evaporative concentrator (section 2.3.7).</P>
            <P>5.2.2 Basic Alumina Column. Shorten a 25-ml disposable Pasteur pipette to about 16 ml. Pack the lower section with glass wool and 12 g of basic alumina. Transfer the concentrated extract from the silica gel column to the top of the basic alumina column and elute the column sequentially with 120 ml of 0.5 percent methylene chloride in hexane followed by 120 ml of 35 percent methylene chloride in hexane. Discard the first 120 ml of eluate. Collect the second 120 ml of eluate and concentrate it to about 0.5 ml using the nitrogen evaporative concentrator.</P>

            <P>5.2.3 AX-21 Carbon/Celite 545 Column. Remove the botton 0.5 in. from the tip of a 9-ml disposable Pasteur pipette. Insert a glass fiber filter disk in the top of the pipette 2.5 cm from the constriction. Add sufficient carbon/celite mixture to form a 2 cm column. Top with a glass wool plug. In some cases AX-21 carbon fines may wash through the glass wool plug and enter the sample. This may be prevented by adding a celite plug to the exit end of the column. Rinse the column in sequence with 2 ml of 50 percent benzene in ethyl acetate, 1 ml of 50 percent methylene chloride in cyclohexane, and 2 ml of hexane. Discard these rinses. Transfer the concentrate in 1 ml of hexane from the basic alumina column to the carbon/celite column along with 1 ml of hexane rinse. Elute the column sequentially with 2 ml of 50 percent methylene chloride in hexane and 2 ml of 50 percent benzene in ethyl acetate and discard these eluates. Invert the column and elute in the reverse direction with 13 ml of toluene. Collect this eluate. Concentrate the eluate in a rotary evaporator at 50 °C to about 1 ml. Transfer the concentrate to a Reacti-vial using a toluene rinse and concentrate to a volume of 200 µl using a stream of N<E T="52">2</E>. Store extracts at room temperature, shielded from light, until the analysis is performed.</P>
            <P>5.3 Analysis. Analyze the sample with a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) using the instrumental parameters in sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2. Immediately prior to analysis, add a 20 µl aliquot of the Recovery Standard solution from Table 1 to each sample. A 2 µl aliquot of the extract is injected into the GC. Sample extracts are first analyzed using the DB-5 capillary column to determine the concentration of each isomer of PCDD's and PCDF's (tetra-through octa-). If tetra-chlorinated dibenzofurans are detected in this analysis, then analyze another aliquot of the sample in a separate run, using the DB-225 column to measure the 2,3,7,8 tetra-chloro dibenzofuran isomer. Other column systems may be used, provided that the user is able to demonstrate using calibration and performance checks that the column system is able to meet the specifications of section 6.1.2.2.</P>

            <P>1. The integrated ion-abundance ratio (M/M + 2 or M + 2/M + 4) shall be within 15 percent of the theoretical value. The acceptable ion-abundance ratio ranges for the identification of chlorine-containing compounds are given in Table 4.</P>
            <P>2. The retention time for the analytes must be within 3 seconds of the corresponding <SU>1</SU>
              <SU>3</SU> C-labeled internal standard, surrogate or alternate standard.</P>
            <P>3. The monitored ions, shown in Table 3 for a given analyte, shall reach their maximum within 2 seconds of each other.</P>
            <P>4. The identification of specific isomers that do not have corresponding <SU>1</SU>
              <SU>3</SU> C-labeled standards is done by comparison of the relative retention time (RRT) of the analyte to the nearest internal standard retention time with reference (i.e., within 0.005 RRT units) to the comparable RRT's found in the continuing calibration.</P>
            <P>5. The signal to noise ratio for all monitored ions must be greater than 2.5.</P>
            <P>6. The confirmation of 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDD and 2, 3, 7, 8-TCDF shall satisfy all of the above identification criteria.</P>
            <P>7. For the identification of PCDF's, no signal may be found in the corresponding PCDPE channels.</P>
            <P>5.3.2.6 Quantification. The peak areas for the two ions monitored for each analyte are summed to yield the total response for each analyte. Each internal standard is used to quantify the indigenous PCDD's or PCDF's in its homologous series. For example, the <SU>1</SU>
              <SU>3</SU> C <E T="52">12</E>-2,3,7,8-tetra chlorinated dibenzodioxin is used to calculate the concentrations of all <PRTPAGE P="499"/>other tetra chlorinated isomers. Recoveries of the tetra- and penta- internal standards are calculated using the <SU>1</SU>
              <SU>3</SU> C <E T="52">12</E>-1,2,3,4-TCDD. Recoveries of the hexa- through octa- internal standards are calculated using <SU>1</SU>
              <SU>3</SU> C <E T="52">12</E>-1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD. Recoveries of the surrogate standards are calculated using the corresponding homolog from the internal standard.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. Calibration</HD>
            <P>Same as Method 5 with the following additions.</P>
            <P>6.1 GC/MS System.</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Initial Calibration. Calibrate the GC/MS system using the set of five standards shown in Table 2. The relative standard deviation for the mean response factor from each of the unlabeled analytes (Table 2) and of the internal, surrogate, and alternate standards shall be less than or equal to the values in Table 5. The signal to noise ratio for the GC signal present in every selected ion current profile shall be greater than or equal to 2.5. The ion abundance ratios shall be within the control limits in Table 4.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Daily Performance Check.</P>
            <P>6.1.2.1 Calibration Check. Inject on µl of solution Number 3 from Table 2. Calculate the relative response factor (RRF) for each compound and compare each RRF to the corresponding mean RRF obtained during the initial calibration. The analyzer performance is acceptable if the measured RRF's for the labeled and unlabeled compounds for the daily run are within the limits of the mean values shown in Table 5. In addition, the ion-abundance ratios shall be within the allowable control limits shown in Table 4.</P>
            <P>6.1.2.2 Column Separation Check. Inject a solution of a mixture of PCDD's and PCDF's that documents resolution between 2,3,7,8-TCDD and other TCDD isomers. Resolution is defined as a valley between peaks that is less than 25 percent of the lower of the two peaks. Identify and record the retention time windows for each homologous series.</P>
            <P>Perform a similar resolution check on the confirmation column to document the resolution between 2,3,7,8 TCDF and other TCDF isomers.</P>
            <P>6.2 Lock Channels. Set mass spectrometer lock channels as specified in Table 3. Monitor the quality control check channels specified in Table 3 to verify instrument stability during the analysis.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7. Quality Control</HD>
            <P>7.1 Sampling Train Collection Efficiency Check. Add 100 µl of the surrogate standards in Table 1 to the absorbent cartridge of each train before collecting the field samples.</P>
            <P>7.2 Internal Standard Percent Recoveries. A group of nine carbon labeled PCDD's and PCDF's representing, the tetra-through octachlorinated homologues, is added to every sample prior to extraction. The role of the internal standards is to quantify the native PCDD's and PCDF's present in the sample as well as to determine the overall method efficiency. Recoveries of the internal standards must be between 40 to 130 percent for the tetra-through hexachlorinated compounds while the range is 25 to 130 percent for the higher hepta- and octachlorinated homologues.</P>
            <P>7.3 Surrogate Recoveries. The five surrogate compounds in Table 2 are added to the resin in the adsorbent sampling cartridge before the sample is collected. The surrogate recoveries are measured relative to the internal standards and are a measure of collection efficiency. They are not used to measure native PCDD's and PCDF's. All recoveries shall be between 70 and 130 percent. Poor recoveries for all the surrogates may be an indication of breakthrough in the sampling train. If the recovery of all standards is below 70 percent, the sampling runs must be repeated. As an alternative, the sampling runs do not have to be repeated if the final results are divided by the fraction of surrogate recovery. Poor recoveries of isolated surrogate compounds should not be grounds for rejecting an entire set of the samples.</P>
            <P>7.4 Toluene QA Rinse. Report the results of the toluene QA rinse separately from the total sample catch. Do not add it to the total sample.</P>

              <P>Not applicable to UV radiation-cured coatings). The variety of coatings that may be subject to analysis makes it necessary to verify the ability of the analyst and the analytical procedures to obtain reproducible results for the coatings tested. Verification is accomplished by running duplicate analyses on each sample tested (Sections 11.2 through 11.4) and comparing the results with the intra-laboratory precision statements (Section 13.1) for each parameter.</P>

            <P>11.2.1 Sample Preparation.</P>
            <P>11.2.1.1 Prepare about 100 ml of sample by mixing the components in a storage container, such as a glass jar with a screw top or a metal can with a cap. The storage container should be just large enough to hold the mixture. Combine the components (by weight or volume) in the ratio recommended by the manufacturer. Tightly close the container between additions and during mixing to prevent loss of volatile materials. However, most manufacturers mixing instructions are by volume. Because of possible error caused by expansion of the liquid when measuring the volume, it is recommended that the components be combined by weight. When weight is used to combine the components and the manufacturer's recommended ratio is by volume, the density must be determined by section 11.3.3.</P>
            <P>11.2.1.2 Immediately after mixing, take aliquots from this 100 ml sample for determination of the total volatile content, water content, and density.</P>

            <P>11.2.2 Volatile Content. To determine total volatile content, use the apparatus and <PRTPAGE P="504"/>reagents described in ASTM D2369 (incorporated by reference; see § 60.17 for the approved versions of the standard), respectively, and use the following procedures:</P>

            <P>11.2.2.1 Weigh and record the weight of an aluminum foil weighing dish. Add 3 ±1 ml of suitable solvent as specified in ASTM D2369 to the weighing dish. Using a syringe as specified in ASTM D2369, weigh to 1 mg, by difference, a sample of coating into the weighing dish. For coatings believed to have a volatile content less than 40 weight percent, a suitable size is 0.3 + 0.10 g, but for coatings believed to have a volatile content greater than 40 weight percent, a suitable size is 0.5 ±0.1 g.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>If the volatile content determined pursuant to section 12.4 is not in the range corresponding to the sample size chosen repeat the test with the appropriate sample size. Add the specimen dropwise, shaking (swirling) the dish to disperse the specimen completely in the solvent. If the material forms a lump that cannot be dispersed, discard the specimen and prepare a new one. Similarly, prepare a duplicate. The sample shall stand for a minimum of 1 hour, but no more than 24 hours prior to being oven cured at 110 ±5 °C (230 ±9 °F) for 1 hour.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>11.2.2.2 Heat the aluminum foil dishes containing the dispersed specimens in the forced draft oven for 60 min at 110 ±5 °C (230 ±9 °F). Caution—provide adequate ventilation, consistent with accepted laboratory practice, to prevent solvent vapors from accumulating to a dangerous level.</P>
            <P>11.2.2.3 Remove the dishes from the oven, place immediately in a desiccator, cool to ambient temperature, and weigh to within 1 mg.</P>

            <P>11.2.2.4 Run analyses in pairs (duplicate sets) for each coating mixture until the criterion in section 11.4 is met. Calculate W<E T="52">V</E> following Equation 24-2 and record the arithmetic average.</P>
            <P>11.2.3 Water Content. To determine water content, follow section 11.3.2.</P>
            <P>11.2.4 Coating Density. To determine coating density, follow section 11.3.3.</P>
            <P>11.2.5 Solids Content. To determine solids content, follow section 11.3.4.</P>

            <P>11.3.4 Solids Content. Determine the volume fraction (V<E T="52">s</E>) solids of the coating by calculation using the manufacturer's formulation.</P>

            <P>11.3.5 Exempt Solvent Content. Determine the weight fraction of exempt solvents (W<E T="52">E</E>) by using ASTM Method D4457. Run a duplicate set of determinations and record the arithmetic average (W<E T="52">E</E>).</P>
            <P>11.4 Sample Analysis Criteria. For W<E T="52">v</E> and W<E T="52">w</E>, run duplicate analyses until the difference between the two values in a set is less than or equal to the intra-laboratory precision statement for that parameter.

            <P>1.2 Applicability.</P>
            <P>1.2.1 This method is applicable for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOC) (measured as total gaseous nonmethane organics (TGNMO) and reported as carbon) in stationary source emissions. This method is not applicable for the determination of organic particulate matter.</P>
            <P>1.2.2 This method is not the only method that applies to the measurement of VOC. Costs, logistics, and other practicalities of source testing may make other test methods more desirable for measuring VOC contents of certain effluent streams. Proper judgment is required in determining the most applicable VOC test method. For example, depending upon the molecular composition of the organics in the effluent stream, a totally automated semicontinuous nonmethane organics (NMO) analyzer interfaced directly to the source may yield accurate results. This approach has the advantage of providing emission data semicontinuously over an extended time period.</P>

            <P>1.2.3 Direct measurement of an effluent with a flame ionization detector (FID) analyzer may be appropriate with prior characterization of the gas stream and knowledge that the detector responds predictably to the organic compounds in the stream. If present, methane (CH<E T="52">4</E>) will, of course, also be measured. The FID can be used under any of the following limited conditions: (1) Where only one compound is known to exist; (2) when the organic compounds consist of only hydrogen and carbon; (3) where the relative percentages of the compounds are known or can be determined, and the FID responses to the compounds are known; (4) where a consistent mixture of the compounds exists before and after emission control and only the relative concentrations are to be assessed; or (5) where the FID can be calibrated against mass standards of the compounds emitted (solvent emissions, for example).</P>
            <P>1.2.4 Another example of the use of a direct FID is as a screening method. If there is enough information available to provide a rough estimate of the analyzer accuracy, the FID analyzer can be used to determine the VOC content of an uncharacterized gas stream. With a sufficient buffer to account for possible inaccuracies, the direct FID can be a useful tool to obtain the desired results without costly exact determination.</P>

            <P>1.2.5 In situations where a qualitative/quantitative analysis of an effluent stream is desired or required, a gas chromatographic FID system may apply. However, for sources emitting numerous organics, the time and expense of this approach will be formidable.<PRTPAGE P="508"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 An emission sample is withdrawn from the stack at a constant rate through a heated filter and a chilled condensate trap by means of an evacuated sample tank. After sampling is completed, the TGNMO are determined by independently analyzing the condensate trap and sample tank fractions and combining the analytical results. The organic content of the condensate trap fraction is determined by oxidizing the NMO to carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) and quantitatively collecting in the effluent in an evacuated vessel; then a portion of the CO<E T="52">2</E> is reduced to CH<E T="52">4</E> and measured by an FID. The organic content of the sample tank fraction is measured by injecting a portion of the sample into a gas chromatographic column to separate the NMO from carbon monoxide (CO), CO<E T="52">2</E>, and CH<E T="52">4</E>; the NMO are oxidized to CO<E T="52">2</E>, reduced to CH<E T="52">4</E>, and measured by an FID. In this manner, the variable response of the FID associated with different types of organics is eliminated.</P>

            <P>4.1 Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapor. When carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) and water vapor are present together in the stack, they can produce a positive bias in the sample. The magnitude of the bias depends on the concentrations of CO<E T="52">2</E> and water vapor. As a guideline, multiply the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration, expressed as volume percent, times the water vapor concentration. If this product does not exceed 100, the bias can be considered insignificant. For example, the bias is not significant for a source having 10 percent CO<E T="52">2</E> and 10 percent water vapor, but it might be significant for a source having 10 percent CO<E T="52">2</E> and 20 percent water vapor.</P>
            <P>4.2. Particulate Matter. Collection of organic particulate matter in the condensate trap would produce a positive bias. A filter is included in the sampling equipment to minimize this bias.</P>

The outer shell is a metal box that measures 102 mm × 280 mm × 292 mm (4 in. × 11 in. × 11<FR>1/2</FR> in.), while the inner shell is a metal box measuring 76 mm × 229 mm × 241 mm (3 in. × 9 in. × 9<FR>1/2</FR> in.). The inner box is supported by 13-mm (<FR>1/2</FR>-in.) phenolic rods. The void space between the boxes is filled with ceramic fiber insulation which is sealed in place by means of a silicon rubber bead around the upper sides of the box. A removable lid made in a similar manner, with a 25-mm (1-in.) gap between the parts is used to cover the heating chamber. The inner box is heated with a 250-watt cartridge heater, shielded by a stainless steel shroud. The heater is regulated by a thermostatic temperature controller which is set to maintain a gas temperature of 121 °C (250 °F) as measured by the temperature sensor upstream of the filter.

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage</HD>
            <P>8.1 Sampling Equipment Preparation.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 Condensate Trap Cleaning. Before its initial use and after each use, a condensate trap should be thoroughly cleaned and checked to ensure that it is not contaminated. Both cleaning and checking can be accomplished by installing the trap in the condensate recovery system and treating it as if it were a sample. The trap should be heated as described in section 11.1.3. A trap may be considered clean when the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration in its effluent gas drops below 10 ppm. This check is optional for traps that most recently have been used to collect samples which were then recovered according to the procedure in section 11.1.3.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Sample Tank Evacuation and Leak-Check. Evacuate the sample tank to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure or less. Then close the sample tank valve, and allow the tank to sit for 60 minutes. The tank is acceptable if a change in tank vacuum of less than 1 mm Hg is noted. The evacuation and leak-check may be conducted either in the laboratory or the field.</P>

            <P>8.1.3 Sampling Train Assembly. Just before assembly, measure the tank vacuum using a mercury manometer. Record this vacuum, the ambient temperature, and the barometric pressure at this time. Close the sample tank valve and assemble the sampling <PRTPAGE P="511"/>system as shown in Figure 25-1. Immerse the condensate trap body in dry ice at least 30 minutes before commencing sampling to improve collection efficiency. The point where the inlet tube joins the trap body should be 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in.) above the top of the dry ice.</P>
            <P>8.1.4 Pretest Leak-Check. A pretest leak-check is required. Calculate or measure the approximate volume of the sampling train from the probe tip to the sample tank valve. After assembling the sampling train, plug the probe tip, and make certain that the sample tank valve is closed. Turn on the vacuum pump, and evacuate the sampling system from the probe tip to the sample tank valve to an absolute pressure of 10 mm Hg or less. Close the purge valve, turn off the pump, wait a minimum period of 10 minutes, and recheck the indicated vacuum. Calculate the maximum allowable pressure change based on a leak rate of 1 percent of the sampling rate using Equation 25-1, section 12.2. If the measured pressure change exceeds the allowable, correct the problem and repeat the leak-check before beginning sampling.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sample Collection.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Unplug the probe tip, and place the probe into the stack such that the probe is perpendicular to the duct or stack axis; locate the probe tip at a single preselected point of average velocity facing away from the direction of gas flow. For stacks having a negative static pressure, seal the sample port sufficiently to prevent air in-leakage around the probe. Set the probe temperature controller to 129 °C (265 °F) and the filter temperature controller to 121 °C (250 °F). Allow the probe and filter to heat for about 30 minutes before purging the sample train.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Close the sample valve, open the purge valve, and start the vacuum pump. Set the flow rate between 60 and 100 cm<SU>3</SU>/min (0.13 and 0.21 ft<SU>3</SU>/hr), and purge the train with stack gas for at least 10 minutes.</P>

            <P>8.2.3 When the temperatures at the exit ends of the probe and filter are within the corresponding specified ranges, check the dry ice level around the condensate trap, and add dry ice if necessary. Record the clock time. To begin sampling, close the purge valve and stop the pump. Open the sample valve and the sample tank valve. Using the flow control valve, set the flow through the sample train to the proper rate. Adjust the flow rate as necessary to maintain a constant rate (±10 percent) throughout the duration of the sampling period. Record the sample tank vacuum and flowmeter setting at 5-minute intervals. (See Figure 25-8.) Select a total sample time greater than or equal to the minimum sampling time specified in the applicable subpart of the regulations; end the sampling when this time period is reached or when a constant flow rate can no longer be maintained because of reduced sample tank vacuum.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>If sampling had to be stopped before obtaining the minimum sampling time (specified in the applicable subpart) because a constant flow rate could not be maintained, proceed as follows: After closing the sample tank valve, remove the used sample tank from the sampling train (without disconnecting other portions of the sampling train). Take another evacuated and leak-checked sample tank, measure and record the tank vacuum, and attach the new tank to the sampling train. After the new tank is attached to the sample train, proceed with the sampling until the required minimum sampling time has been exceeded.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.3 Sample Recovery. After sampling is completed, close the flow control valve, and record the final tank vacuum; then record the tank temperature and barometric pressure. Close the sample tank valve, and disconnect the sample tank from the sample system. Disconnect the condensate trap at the inlet to the rate meter, and tightly seal both ends of the condensate trap. Do not include the probe from the stack to the filter as part of the condensate sample.</P>
            <P>8.4 Sample Storage and Transport. Keep the trap packed in dry ice until the samples are returned to the laboratory for analysis. Ensure that run numbers are identified on the condensate trap and the sample tank(s).</P>

Analyze each new tank of carrier gas or auxiliary O<E T="52">2</E> with the NMO analyzer to <PRTPAGE P="512"/>check for contamination. Treat the gas cylinders as noncondensible gas samples, and analyze according to the procedure in section 11.2.3. Add together any measured CH<E T="52">4</E>, CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, or NMO. The total concentration must be less than 5 ppm.</P>
            <P>10.1.1.2 Oxidation Catalyst Efficiency Check.</P>
            <P>10.1.1.2.1 With a clean condensate trap installed in the recovery system or a <FR>1/8</FR>″ stainless steel connector tube, replace the carrier gas cylinder with the high level methane standard gas cylinder (Section 7.4.1). Set the four-port valve to the recovery position, and attach an ICV to the recovery system. With the sample recovery valve in vent position and the flow-control and ICV valves fully open, evacuate the manometer or gauge, the connecting tubing, and the ICV to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure. Close the flow-control and vacuum pump valves.</P>

            <P>10.1.1.2.2 After the NDIR response has stabilized, switch the sample recovery valve from vent to collect. When the manometer or pressure gauge begins to register a slight positive pressure, open the flow-control valve. Keep the flow adjusted such that the pressure in the system is maintained within 10 percent of atmospheric pressure. Continue collecting the sample in a normal manner until the ICV is filled to a nominal gauge pressure of 300 mm Hg. Close the ICV valve, and remove the ICV from the system. Place the sample recovery valve in the vent position, and return the recovery system to its normal carrier gas and normal operating conditions. Analyze the ICV for CO<E T="52">2</E> using the NMO analyzer; the catalyst efficiency is acceptable if the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration is within 2 percent of the methane standard concentration.</P>

            <P>10.1.1.3 System Performance Check. Construct a liquid sample injection unit similar in design to the unit shown in Figure 25-7. Insert this unit into the condensate recovery and conditioning system in place of a condensate trap, and set the carrier gas and auxiliary O<E T="52">2</E> flow rates to normal operating levels. Attach an evacuated ICV to the system, and switch from system vent to collect. With the carrier gas routed through the injection unit and the oxidation catalyst, inject a liquid sample (see sections 10.1.1.3.1 to 10.1.1.3.4) into the injection port. Operate the trap recovery system as described in section 11.1.3. Measure the final ICV pressure, and then analyze the vessel to determine the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration. For each injection, calculate the percent recovery according to section 12.7. Calculate the relative standard deviation for each set of triplicate injections according to section 12.8. The performance test is acceptable if the average percent recovery is 100 ±5 percent and the relative standard deviation is less than 2 percent for each set of triplicate injections.</P>

            <P>10.1.2 NMO Analyzer. Perform these tests before the system is first placed in operation, after any shutdown longer than 6 months, and after any major modification of the system.</P>
            <P>10.1.2.1 Oxidation Catalyst Efficiency Check. Turn off or bypass the NMO analyzer reduction catalyst. Make triplicate injections of the high level methane standard (Section 7.4.1). The oxidation catalyst operation is acceptable if the FID response is less than 1 percent of the injected methane concentration.</P>
            <P>10.1.2.2 Reduction Catalyst Efficiency Check. With the oxidation catalyst unheated or bypassed and the heated reduction catalyst bypassed, make triplicate injections of the high level methane standard (Section 7.4.1). Repeat this procedure with both catalysts operative. The reduction catalyst operation is acceptable if the responses under both conditions agree within 5 percent of their average.</P>

            <P>10.1.2.3 NMO Analyzer Linearity Check Calibration. While operating both the oxidation and reduction catalysts, conduct a linearity check of the analyzer using the propane standards specified in section 7.4.2. Make triplicate injections of each calibration gas. For each gas (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> each set of triplicate injections), calculate the average response factor (area/ppm C) for each gas, as well as and the relative standard deviation (according to section 12.8). Then calculate the overall mean of the response factor values. The instrument linearity is acceptable if the average response factor of each calibration gas is within 2.5 percent of the overall mean value and if the relative standard deviation gas is less than 2 percent of the overall mean value. Record the overall mean of the propane response factor values as the NMO calibration response factor (RF<E T="52">NMO</E>). Repeat the linearity check using the CO<E T="52">2</E> standards specified in section 7.4.3. Make triplicate injections of each gas, and then calculate the average response factor (area/ppm C) for each gas, as well as the overall mean of the response factor values. Record the overall mean of the response factor values as the CO<E T="52">2</E> calibration response factor (RF<E T="52">CO2</E>). The RF<E T="52">CO2</E> must be within 10 percent of the RF<E T="52">NMO</E>.</P>
            <P>10.1.2.4 System Performance Check. Check the column separation and overall performance of the analyzer by making triplicate injections of the calibration gases listed in section 7.4.4. The analyzer performance is acceptable if the measured NMO value for each gas (average of triplicate injections) is within 5 percent of the expected value.</P>

            <P>10.2 NMO Analyzer Daily Calibration. The following calibration procedures shall be performed before and immediately after the <PRTPAGE P="513"/>analysis of each set of samples, or on a daily basis, whichever is more stringent:</P>
            <P>10.2.1 CO<E T="52">2</E> Response Factor. Inject triplicate samples of the high level CO<E T="52">2</E> calibration gas (Section 7.4.3), and calculate the average response factor. The system operation is adequate if the calculated response factor is within 5 percent of the RF<E T="52">CO2</E> calculated during the initial performance test (Section 10.1.2.3). Use the daily response factor (DRF<E T="52">CO2</E>) for analyzer calibration and the calculation of measured CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations in the ICV samples.</P>

            <P>10.2.2 NMO Response Factors. Inject triplicate samples of the mixed propane calibration cylinder gas (Section 7.4.4.1), and calculate the average NMO response factor. The system operation is adequate if the calculated response factor is within 10 percent of the RF<E T="52">NMO</E> calculated during the initial performance test (Section 10.1.2.4). Use the daily response factor (DRF<E T="52">NMO</E>) for analyzer calibration and calculation of NMO concentrations in the sample tanks.</P>
            <P>10.3 Sample Tank and ICV Volume. The volume of the gas sampling tanks used must be determined. Determine the tank and ICV volumes by weighing them empty and then filled with deionized distilled water; weigh to the nearest 5 g, and record the results. Alternatively, measure the volume of water used to fill them to the nearest 5 ml.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>
            <P>11.1 Condensate Recovery. See Figure 25-9. Set the carrier gas flow rate, and heat the catalyst to its operating temperature to condition the apparatus.</P>
            <P>11.1.1 Daily Performance Checks. Each day before analyzing any samples, perform the following tests:</P>
            <P>11.1.1.1 Leak-Check. With the carrier gas inlets and the sample recovery valve closed, install a clean condensate trap in the system, and evacuate the system to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure or less. Monitor the system pressure for 10 minutes. The system is acceptable if the pressure change is less than 2 mm Hg.</P>

            <P>11.1.1.2 System Background Test. Adjust the carrier gas and auxiliary oxygen flow rate to their normal values of 100 cc/min and 150 cc/min, respectively, with the sample recovery valve in vent position. Using a 10-ml syringe, withdraw a sample from the system effluent through the syringe port. Inject this sample into the NMO analyzer, and measure the CO<E T="52">2</E> content. The system background is acceptable if the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration is less than 10 ppm.</P>
            <P>11.1.1.3 Oxidation Catalyst Efficiency Check. Conduct a catalyst efficiency test as specified in section 10.1.1.2. If the criterion of this test cannot be met, make the necessary repairs to the system before proceeding.</P>
            <P>11.1.2 Condensate Trap CO<E T="52">2</E> Purge and Sample Tank Pressurization.</P>

            <P>11.1.2.1 After sampling is completed, the condensate trap will contain condensed water and organics and a small volume of sampled gas. This gas from the stack may contain a significant amount of CO<E T="52">2</E> which must be removed from the condensate trap before the sample is recovered. This is accomplished by purging the condensate trap with zero air and collecting the purged gas in the original sample tank.</P>

            <P>11.1.2.2 Begin with the sample tank and condensate trap from the test run to be analyzed. Set the four-port valve of the condensate recovery system in the CO<E T="52">2</E> purge position as shown in Figure 25-9. With the sample tank valve closed, attach the sample tank to the sample recovery system. With the sample recovery valve in the vent position and the flow control valve fully open, evacuate the manometer or pressure gauge to the vacuum of the sample tank. Next, close the vacuum pump valve, open the sample tank valve, and record the tank pressure.</P>

            <P>11.1.2.3 Attach the dry ice-cooled condensate trap to the recovery system, and initiate the purge by switching the sample recovery valve from vent to collect position. Adjust the flow control valve to maintain atmospheric pressure in the recovery system. Continue the purge until the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration of the trap effluent is less than 5 ppm. CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration in the trap effluent should be measured by extracting syringe samples from the recovery system and analyzing the samples with the NMO analyzer. This procedure should be used only after the NDIR response has reached a minimum level. Using a 10-ml syringe, extract a sample from the syringe port prior to the NDIR, and inject this sample into the NMO analyzer.</P>
            <P>11.1.2.4 After the completion of the CO<E T="52">2</E> purge, use the carrier gas bypass valve to pressurize the sample tank to approximately 1,060 mm Hg absolute pressure with zero air.</P>
            <P>11.1.3 Recovery of the Condensate Trap Sample (See Figure 25-10).</P>
            <P>11.1.3.1 Attach the ICV to the sample recovery system. With the sample recovery valve in a closed position, between vent and collect, and the flow control and ICV valves fully open, evacuate the manometer or gauge, the connecting tubing, and the ICV to 10 mm Hg absolute pressure. Close the flow-control and vacuum pump valves.</P>

            <P>11.1.3.2 Begin auxiliary oxygen flow to the oxidation catalyst at a rate of 150 cc/min, then switch the four-way valve to the trap recovery position and the sample recovery valve to collect position. The system should now be set up to operate as indicated in Figure 25-10. After the manometer or pressure gauge begins to register a slight positive pressure, open the flow control valve. Adjust the flow-control valve to maintain atmospheric pressure in the system within 10 percent.<PRTPAGE P="514"/>
            </P>

            <P>11.1.3.3 Remove the condensate trap from the dry ice, and allow it to warm to ambient temperature while monitoring the NDIR response. If, after 5 minutes, the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration of the catalyst effluent is below 10,000 ppm, discontinue the auxiliary oxygen flow to the oxidation catalyst. Begin heating the trap by placing it in a furnace preheated to 200 °C (390 °F). Once heating has begun, carefully monitor the NDIR response to ensure that the catalyst effluent concentration does not exceed 50,000 ppm. Whenever the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration exceeds 50,000 ppm, supply auxiliary oxygen to the catalyst at the rate of 150 cc/min. Begin heating the tubing that connected the heated sample box to the condensate trap only after the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration falls below 10,000 ppm. This tubing may be heated in the same oven as the condensate trap or with an auxiliary heat source such as a heat gun. Heating temperature must not exceed 200 °C (390 °F). If a heat gun is used, heat the tubing slowly along its entire length from the upstream end to the downstream end, and repeat the pattern for a total of three times. Continue the recovery until the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration drops to less than 10 ppm as determined by syringe injection as described under the condensate trap CO<E T="52">2</E> purge procedure (Section 11.1.2).</P>
            <P>11.1.3.4 After the sample recovery is completed, use the carrier gas bypass valve to pressurize the ICV to approximately 1060 mm Hg absolute pressure with zero air.</P>

            <P>11.2 Analysis. Once the initial performance test of the NMO analyzer has been successfully completed (see section 10.1.2) and the daily CO<E T="52">2</E> and NMO response factors have been determined (see section 10.2), proceed with sample analysis as follows:</P>

            <P>11.2.1 Operating Conditions. The carrier gas flow rate is 29.5 cc/min He and 2.2 cc/min O<E T="52">2</E>. The column oven is heated to 85 °C (185 °F). The order of elution for the sample from the column is CO, CH<E T="52">4</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and NMO.</P>

            <P>11.2.2 Analysis of Recovered Condensate Sample. Purge the sample loop with sample, and then inject the sample. Under the specified operating conditions, the CO<E T="52">2</E> in the sample will elute in approximately 100 seconds. As soon as the detector response returns to baseline following the CO<E T="52">2</E> peak, switch the carrier gas flow to backflush, and raise the column oven temperature to 195 °C (380 °F) as rapidly as possible. A rate of 30 °C/min (90 °F) has been shown to be adequate. Record the value obtained for the condensible organic material (C<E T="52">cm</E>) measured as CO<E T="52">2</E> and any measured NMO. Return the column oven temperature to 85 °C (185 °F) in preparation for the next analysis. Analyze each sample in triplicate, and report the average C<E T="52">cm</E>.</P>

            <P>11.2.3 Analysis of Sample Tank. Perform the analysis as described in section 11.2.2, but record only the value measured for NMO (C<E T="52">tm</E>).</P>

            <P>6.1.5 Particulate Filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is significant. An out-of-stack filter should be heated to prevent any condensation.</P>
            <P>6.1.6 Recorder. A strip-chart recorder, analog computer, or digital recorder for recording measurement data. The minimum data recording requirement is one measurement value per minute.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>

            <P>7.1 Calibration Gases. The calibration gases for the gas analyzer shall be propane in air or propane in nitrogen. Alternatively, organic compounds other than propane can be used; the appropriate corrections for response factor must be made. Calibration gases shall be prepared in accordance with the procedure listed in Citation 2 of section 16. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than ±2 percent from the certified value. For calibration gas values not generally available (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> organics between 1 and 10 percent by volume), alternative methods for preparing calibration gas mixtures, such as dilution systems (Test Method 205, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M), may be used with prior approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>7.1.1 Fuel. A 40 percent H<E T="52">2</E>/60 percent N<E T="52">2</E> gas mixture is recommended to avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs when oxygen concentration varies significantly from a mean value.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</HD>

            <P>8.1 Selection of Sampling Site. The location of the sampling site is generally specified by the applicable regulation or purpose of the test (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> exhaust stack, inlet line, etc.). The sample port shall be located to meet the testing requirements of Method 1.</P>
            <P>8.2 Location of Sample Probe. Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally located in the stack, pipe, or duct and is sealed tightly at the stack port connection.</P>
            <P>8.3 Measurement System Preparation. Prior to the emission test, assemble the measurement system by following the manufacturer's written instructions for preparing sample interface and the organic analyzer. Make the system operable (Section 10.1).</P>
            <P>8.4 Calibration Error Test. Immediately prior to the test series (within 2 hours of the start of the test), introduce zero gas and high-level calibration gas at the calibration valve assembly. Adjust the analyzer output to the appropriate levels, if necessary. Calculate the predicted response for the low-level and mid-level gases based on a linear response line between the zero and high-level response. Then introduce low-level and mid-level calibration gases successively to the measurement system. Record the analyzer responses for low-level and mid-level calibration gases and determine the differences between the measurement system responses and the predicted responses. These differences must be less than 5 percent of the respective calibration gas value. If not, the measurement system is not acceptable and must be replaced or repaired prior to testing. No adjustments to the measurement system shall be conducted after the calibration and before the drift check (Section 8.6.2). If adjustments are necessary before the completion of the test series, perform the drift checks prior to the required adjustments and repeat the calibration following the adjustments. If multiple electronic ranges are to be used, each additional range must be checked with a mid-level calibration gas to verify the multiplication factor.</P>
            <P>8.5 Response Time Test. Introduce zero gas into the measurement system at the calibration valve assembly. When the system output has stabilized, switch quickly to the high-level calibration gas. Record the time from the concentration change to the measurement system response equivalent to 95 percent of the step change. Repeat the test three times and average the results.</P>
            <P>8.6 Emission Measurement Test Procedure.</P>

            <P>8.6.1 Organic Measurement. Begin sampling at the start of the test period, recording time and any required process information as appropriate. In particulate, note on the recording chart, periods of process interruption or cyclic operation.<PRTPAGE P="528"/>
            </P>

            <P>8.6.2 Drift Determination. Immediately following the completion of the test period and hourly during the test period, reintroduce the zero and mid-level calibration gases, one at a time, to the measurement system at the calibration valve assembly. (Make no adjustments to the measurement system until both the zero and calibration drift checks are made.) Record the analyzer response. If the drift values exceed the specified limits, invalidate the test results preceding the check and repeat the test following corrections to the measurement system. Alternatively, recalibrate the test measurement system as in section 8.4 and report the results using both sets of calibration data (i.e., data determined prior to the test period and data determined following the test period).

            <P>8.1 Sample Tank Evacuation and Leak-Check. Conduct the sample tank evacuation and leak-check either in the laboratory or the field. Connect the pressure gauge and sampling valve to the sample tank. Evacuate the sample tank to 10 mm Hg (5.4 in H<E T="52">2</E>O) absolute pressure or less. Close the sampling valve, and allow the tank to sit for 30 minutes. The tank is acceptable if no change more than ±2 mm is noted. Include the results of the leak-check in the test report.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sample Probe Installation. The tester may use the procedure in section 8.2.1 or 8.2.2.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Pilot Probe Procedure. Use the post driver to drive the pilot probe at least 0.9 m (3 ft) below the landfill cover. Alternative procedures to drive the probe into the landfill may be used subject to the approval of the Administrator's designated representative.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.1 Remove the pilot probe and drive the sample probe into the hole left by the pilot probe. The sample probe shall extend at least 0.9 m (3 ft) below the landfill cover and shall protrude about 0.3 m (1 ft) above the landfill cover. Seal around the sampling probe with bentonite and cap the sampling probe with the sampling probe cap.</P>

            <P>8.2.2 Auger Procedure. Use an auger to drill a hole to at least 0.9 m (3 ft) below the landfill cover. Place the sample probe in the hole and backfill with pea gravel to a level 0.6 m (2 ft) from the surface. The sample probe shall protrude at least 0.3 m (1 ft) above the landfill cover. Seal the remaining area around the probe with bentonite. Allow 24 <PRTPAGE P="532"/>hours for the landfill gases to equilibrate inside the augured probe before sampling.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Driven Probes. Closed-point probes may be driven directly into the landfill in a single step. This method may not require backfilling if the probe is adequately sealed by its insertion. Unperforated probes that are inserted in this manner and withdrawn at a distance from a detachable tip to create an open space are also acceptable.</P>
            <P>8.3 Sample Train Assembly. Just before assembling the sample train, measure the sample tank vacuum using the pressure gauge. Record the vacuum, the ambient temperature, and the barometric pressure at this time. Assemble the sampling probe purging system as shown in Figure 25C-1.</P>

            <P>8.4 Sampling Procedure. Open the sampling valve and use the purge pump and the flow control valve to evacuate at least two sample probe volumes from the system at a flow rate of 500 ml/min or less. Close the sampling valve and replace the purge pump with the sample tank apparatus as shown in Figure 25C-2. Open the sampling valve and the sample tank valve and, using the flow control valve, sample at a flow rate of 500 ml/min or less until either a constant flow rate can no longer be maintained because of reduced sample tank vacuum or the appropriate composite volume is attained. Disconnect the sampling tank apparatus and pressurize the sample cylinder to approximately 1,060 mm Hg (567 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) absolute pressure with helium, and record the final pressure. Alternatively, the sample tank may be pressurized in the lab.</P>
            <P>8.4.1 The following restrictions apply to compositing samples from different probe sites into a single cylinder: (1) Individual composite samples per cylinder must be of equal volume; this must be verified by recording the flow rate, sampling time, vacuum readings, or other appropriate volume measuring data, (2) individual composite samples must have a minimum volume of 1 liter unless data is provided showing smaller volumes can be accurately measured, and (3) composite samples must not be collected using the final cylinder vacuum as it diminishes to ambient pressure.</P>
            <P>8.4.2 Use Method 3C to determine the percent N<E T="52">2</E> in each cylinder. The presence of N<E T="52">2</E> indicates either infiltration of ambient air into the landfill gas sample or an inappropriate testing site has been chosen where anaerobic decomposition has not begun. The landfill gas sample is acceptable if the concentration of N<E T="52">2</E> is less than 20 percent. Alternatively, Method 3C may be used to determine the oxygen content of each cylinder as an air infiltration test. With this option, the oxygen content of each cylinder must be less than 5 percent.</P>

            <P>11.1 The oxidation, reduction, and measurement of NMOC's is similar to Method 25. Before putting the NMOC analyzer into routine operation, conduct an initial performance test. Start the analyzer, and perform all the necessary functions in order to put the analyzer into proper working order. Conduct the performance test according to the procedures established in section 10.1. Once the performance test has been successfully completed and the NMOC calibration response factor has been determined, proceed with sample analysis as follows:</P>

            <P>11.1.1 Daily Operations and Calibration Checks. Before and immediately after the analysis of each set of samples or on a daily basis (whichever occurs first), conduct a calibration test according to the procedures established in section 10.2. If the criteria of the daily calibration test cannot be met, repeat <PRTPAGE P="533"/>the NMOC analyzer performance test (Section 10.1) before proceeding.</P>
            <P>11.1.2 Operating Conditions. Same as in Method 25, section 11.2.1.</P>

            <P>11.1.3 Analysis of Sample Tank. Purge the sample loop with sample, and then inject the sample. Under the specified operating conditions, the CO<E T="52">2</E> in the sample will elute in approximately 100 seconds. As soon as the detector response returns to baseline following the CO<E T="52">2</E> peak, switch the carrier gas flow to backflush, and raise the column oven temperature to 195 °C (383 °F) as rapidly as possible. A rate of 30 °C/min (54 °F/min) has been shown to be adequate. Record the value obtained for any measured NMOC. Return the column oven temperature to 85 °C (185 °F) in preparation for the next analysis. Analyze each sample in triplicate, and report the average as C<E T="52">tm</E>.</P>

            <P>2.1 Principle. A sample of waste is obtained at a point which is most representative of the unexposed waste (where the waste has had minimum opportunity to volatilize to the atmosphere). The sample is suspended in an organic/aqueous matrix, then heated and purged with nitrogen for 30 min. in order to separate certain organic compounds. Part of the sample is analyzed for carbon concentration, as methane, with an FID, and part of the sample is analyzed for chlorine concentration, as chloride, with an ELCD. The VO concentration is the sum of the carbon and chlorine content of the sample.</P>

            <P>9.1 Quality Control Samples. If audit samples are not available, prepare and analyze the two types of quality control samples (QCS) listed in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. Before placing the system in operation, after a shutdown of greater than six months, and after any major modifications, analyze each QCS in triplicate. For each detector, calculate the percent recovery by dividing measured concentration by theoretical concentration and multiplying by 100. Determine the mean percent recovery for each detector for each QCS triplicate analysis. The RSD for any triplicate analysis shall be ≤10 percent. For QCS 1 (methylene chloride), the percent recovery shall be ≥90 percent for carbon as methane, and ≥55 percent for chlorine as chloride. For QCS 2 (1,3-dichloro-2-propanol), the percent recovery shall be ≤15 percent for carbon as methane, and ≤6 percent for chlorine as chloride. If the analytical system does not meet the above-mentioned criteria for both detectors, check the system parameters (temperature, system pressure, purge rate, etc.), correct the problem, and repeat the triplicate analysis of each QCS.</P>

            <P>9.1.1 QCS 1, Methylene Chloride. Prepare a stock solution by weighing, to the nearest 0.1 mg, 55 µL of HPLC grade methylene chloride in a tared 5 mL volumetric flask.

Record the weight in milligrams, dilute to 5 mL with cleaned PEG, and inject 100 µL of the stock solution into a sample prepared as a water blank (50 mL of cleaned PEG and 60 mL of water in the purging flask). Analyze the QCS according to the procedures described in sections 10.2 and 10.3, excluding section 10.2.2. To calculate the theoretical carbon concentration (in mg) in QCS 2, multiply mg of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol in the stock solution by 7.461 × 10<E T="51">−3</E>. To calculate the theoretical chlorine concentration (in mg) in QCS 2, multiply mg of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol in the stock solution by 1.099 × 10<E T="51">−2</E>.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 Calibration and Standardization</HD>
            <P>10.1 Initial Performance Check of Purging System. Before placing the system in operation, after a shutdown of greater than six months, after any major modifications, and at least once per month during continuous operation, conduct the linearity checks described in sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2. Install calibration gas at the three-way calibration gas valve. See Figure 25D-1.</P>

            <P>10.1.1 Linearity Check Procedure. Using the calibration standard described in section 7.2.2.3 and by varying the injection time, it is possible to calibrate at multiple concentration levels. Use Equation 25D-3 to calculate three sets of calibration gas flow rates and run times needed to introduce a total mass of carbon, as methane, (m<E T="52">c</E>) of 1, 5, and 10 mg into the system (low, medium and high FID calibration, respectively). Use Equation 25D-4 to calculate three sets of calibration gas flow rates and run times needed to introduce a total chloride mass (m<E T="52">ch</E>) of 1, 5, and 10 mg into the system (low, medium and high ELCD calibration, respectively). With the system operating in standby mode, allow the FID and the ELCD to establish a stable baseline. Set the secondary pressure regulator of the calibration gas cylinder to the same pressure as the purge gas cylinder and set the proper flow rate with the calibration flow controller (see Figure 25D-1). The calibration gas flow rate can be measured with a flowmeter attached to the vent position of the calibration gas valve. Set the four-way bypass valve to standby position so that the calibration gas flows through the coalescing filter only. Inject the calibration gas by turning the calibration gas valve from vent position to inject position. Continue the calibration gas flow for the appropriate period of time before switching the calibration valve to vent position. Continue recording the response of the FID and the ELCD for 5 min after switching off calibration gas flow. Make triplicate injections of all six levels of calibration.</P>
            <P>10.1.2 Linearity Criteria. Calculate the average response factor (Equations 25D-5 and 25D-6) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) (Equation 25D-10) at each level of the calibration curve for both detectors. Calculate the overall mean of the three response factor averages for each detector. The FID linearity is acceptable if each response factor is within 5 percent of the overall mean and if the RSD for each set of triplicate injections is less than 5 percent. The ELCD linearity is acceptable if each response factor is within 10 percent of the overall mean and if the RSD for each set of triplicate injections is less than 10 percent. Record the overall mean value of the response factors for the FID and the ELCD. If the calibration for either the FID or the ELCD does not meet the criteria, correct the detector/system problem and repeat sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2.</P>
            <P>10.2 Daily Calibrations.</P>
            <P>10.2.1 Daily Linearity Check. Follow the procedures outlined in section 10.1.1 to analyze the medium level calibration for both the FID and the ELCD in duplicate at the start of the day. Calculate the response factors and the RSDs for each detector. For the FID, the calibration is acceptable if the average response factor is within 5 percent of the overall mean response factor (Section 10.1.2) and if the RSD for the duplicate injection is less than 5 percent. For the ELCD, the calibration is acceptable if the average response factor is within 10 percent of the overall mean response factor (Section 10.1.2) and if the RSD for the duplicate injection is less than 10 percent. If the calibration for either the FID or the ELCD does not meet the criteria, correct the detector/system problem and repeat sections 10.1.1 and 10.1.2.</P>
            <P>10.2.2 Calibration Range Check.</P>

            <P>10.2.2.1 If the waste concentration for either detector falls below the range of calibration for that detector, use the procedure outlined in section 10.1.1 to choose two calibration points that bracket the new target <PRTPAGE P="540"/>concentration. Analyze each of these points in triplicate (as outlined in section 10.1.1) and use the criteria in section 10.1.2 to determine the linearity of the detector in this “mini-calibration” range.</P>
            <P>10.2.2.2 After the initial linearity check of the mini-calibration curve, it is only necessary to test one of the points in duplicate for the daily calibration check (in addition to the points specified in section 10.2.1). The average daily mini-calibration point should fit the linearity criteria specified in section 10.2.1. If the calibration for either the FID or the ELCD does not meet the criteria, correct the detector/system problem and repeat the calibration procedure mentioned in the first paragraph of section 10.2.2. A mini-calibration curve for waste concentrations above the calibration curve for either detector is optional.</P>

            <P>11.1.1 Turn on the constant temperature chamber and allow the temperature to equilibrate at 75 ±2 °C (167 ±3.6 °F). Turn the four-way valve so that the purge gas bypasses the purging flask, the purge gas flowing through the coalescing filter and to the detectors (standby mode). Turn on the purge gas. Allow both the FID and the ELCD to warm up until a stable baseline is achieved on each detector. Pack the filter flask with ice. Replace ice after each run and dispose of the waste water properly. When the temperature of the oven reaches 75 ±2 °C (167 ±3.6 °F), start both integrators and record baseline. After 1 min, turn the four-way valve so that the purge gas flows through the purging flask, to the coalescing filter and to the sample splitters (purge mode). Continue recording the response of the FID and the ELCD. Monitor the readings of the pressure gauge and the rotameter. If the readings fall below established setpoints, stop the purging, determine the source of the leak, and resolve the problem before resuming. Leaks detected during a sampling period invalidate that sample.</P>
            <P>11.1.2 As the purging continues, monitor the output of the detectors to make certain that the analysis is proceeding correctly and that the results are being properly recorded. Every 10 minutes read and record the purge flow rate, the pressure and the chamber temperature. Continue the purging for 30 minutes.</P>
            <P>11.1.3 For each detector output, integrate over the entire area of the peak starting at 1 minute and continuing until the end of the run. Subtract the established baseline area from the peak area. Record the corrected area of the peak. See Figure 25D-6 for an example integration.</P>
            <P>11.2 Water Blank. A water blank shall be analyzed for each batch of cleaned PEG prepared. Transfer about 60 mL of water into the purging flask. Add 50 mL of the cleaned PEG to the purging flask. Treat the blank as described in sections 8.2 and 8.3, excluding section 8.2.2. Calculate the concentration of carbon and chlorine in the blank sample (assume 10 g of waste as the mass). A VO concentration equivalent to ≤10 percent of the applicable standard may be subtracted from the measured VO concentration of the waste samples. Include all blank results and documentation in the test report.</P>

            <P>10.1 Use the procedures in sections 10.2 to calibrate the headspace analyzer and FID and check for linearity before the system is first placed in operation, after any shutdown longer than 6 months, and after any modification of the system.</P>
            <P>10.2 Calibration and Linearity. Use the procedures in section 10 of Method 18 of Part 60, Appendix A, to prepare the standards and calibrate the flowmeters, using propane as the standard gas. Fill the calibration standard vials halfway (±5 percent) with deionized water. Purge and fill the airspace with calibration standard. Prepare a minimum of three concentrations of calibration standards in triplicate at concentrations that will bracket the applicable cutoff. For a cutoff of 5.2 kPa (0.75 psi), prepare nominal concentrations of 30,000, 50,000, and 70,000 ppm as propane. For a cutoff of 27.6 kPa (4.0 psi), prepare nominal concentrations of 200,000, 300,000, and 400,000 ppm as propane.</P>
            <P>10.2.1 Use the procedures in section 11.3 to measure the FID response of each standard. Use a linear regression analysis to calculate the values for the slope (k) and the y-intercept (b). Use the procedures in sections 12.3 and 12.2 to test the calibration and the linearity.</P>

            <P>10.3 Daily FID Calibration Check. Check the calibration at the beginning and at the end of the daily runs by using the following procedures. Prepare 2 calibration standards at the nominal cutoff concentration using the procedures in section 10.2. Place one at the beginning and one at the end of the daily run. Measure the FID response of the daily calibration standard and use the values for k and b from the most recent calibration to calculate the concentration of the daily standard. Use an equation similar to 25E-2 to calculate the percent difference between the daily standard and C<E T="52">s</E>. If the difference is within 5 percent, then the previous values for k and b can be used. Otherwise, use the procedures in section 10.2 to recalibrate the FID.</P>

            <P>The test methods in this appendix are referred to in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) and § 60.11 (Compliance With Standards and Maintenance Requirements) of 40 CFR part 60, subpart A (General Provisions). Specific uses of these test methods are described in the standards of performance contained in the subparts, beginning with Subpart D.</P>
            <P>Within each standard of performance, a section title “Test Methods and Procedures” is provided to: (1) Identify the test methods to be used as reference methods to the facility subject to the respective standard and (2) identify any special instructions or conditions to be followed when applying a method to the respective facility. Such instructions (for example, establish sampling rates, volumes, or temperatures) are to be used either in addition to, or as a substitute for procedures in a test method. Similarly, for sources subject to emission monitoring requirements, specific instructions pertaining to any use of a test method as a reference method are provided in the subpart or in Appendix B.</P>
            <P>Inclusion of methods in this appendix is not intended as an endorsement or denial of their applicability to sources that are not subject to standards of performance. The methods are potentially applicable to other sources; however, applicability should be confirmed by careful and appropriate evaluation of the conditions prevalent at such sources.</P>
            <P>The approach followed in the formulation of the test methods involves specifications for equipment, procedures, and performance. In concept, a performance specification approach would be preferable in all methods because this allows the greatest flexibility to the user. In practice, however, this approach is impractical in most cases because performance specifications cannot be established. Most of the methods described herein, therefore, involve specific equipment specifications and procedures, and only a few methods in this appendix rely on performance criteria.</P>
            <P>Minor changes in the test methods should not necessarily affect the validity of the results and it is recognized that alternative and equivalent methods exist. section 60.8 provides authority for the Administrator to specify or approve (1) equivalent methods, (2) alternative methods, and (3) minor changes in the methodology of the test methods. It should be clearly understood that unless otherwise identified all such methods and changes must have prior approval of the Administrator. An owner employing such methods or deviations from the test methods without obtaining prior approval does so at the risk of subsequent disapproval and retesting with approved methods.</P>
            <P>Within the test methods, certain specific equipment or procedures are recognized as being acceptable or potentially acceptable and are specifically identified in the methods. The items identified as acceptable options may be used without approval but must be identified in the test report. The potentially approvable options are cited as “subject to the approval of the Administrator” or as “or equivalent.” Such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives may be used at the discretion of the owner without prior approval. However, detailed descriptions for applying these potentially approvable techniques or alternatives are not provided in the test methods. Also, the potentially approvable options are not necessarily acceptable in all applications. Therefore, an owner electing to use such potentially approvable techniques or alternatives is responsible for: (1) assuring that the techniques or alternatives are in fact applicable and are properly executed; (2) including a written description of the alternative method in the test report (the written method must be clear and must be capable of being performed without additional instruction, and the degree of detail should be similar to the detail contained in the test methods); and (3) providing any rationale or supporting data necessary to show the validity of the alternative in the particular application. Failure to meet these requirements can result in the Administrator's disapproval of the alternative.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for determining emissions of hydrogen halides (HX) (HCl, HBr, and HF) and halogens (X<E T="52">2</E>) (Cl<E T="52">2</E> and Br<E T="52">2</E>) from stationary sources when specified by the applicable subpart. Sources, such as those controlled by wet scrubbers, that emit acid particulate matter must be sampled using Method 26A.<PRTPAGE P="553"/>
            </P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 An integrated sample is extracted from the source and passed through a prepurged heated probe and filter into dilute sulfuric acid and dilute sodium hydroxide solutions which collect the gaseous hydrogen halides and halogens, respectively. The filter collects particulate matter including halide salts but is not routinely recovered and analyzed. The hydrogen halides are solubilized in the acidic solution and form chloride (Cl<E T="51">−</E>), bromide (Br<E T="51">−</E>), and fluoride (F<E T="51">−</E>) ions. The halogens have a very low solubility in the acidic solution and pass through to the alkaline solution where they are hydrolyzed to form a proton (H<SU> + </SU>), the halide ion, and the hypohalous acid (HClO or HBrO). Sodium thiosulfate is added in excess to the alkaline solution to assure reaction with the hypohalous acid to form a second halide ion such that 2 halide ions are formed for each molecule of halogen gas. The halide ions in the separate solutions are measured by ion chromatography (IC).</P>

            </HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>
            <P>4.1 Volatile materials, such as chlorine dioxide (ClO<E T="52">2</E>) and ammonium chloride (NH<E T="52">4</E>Cl), which produce halide ions upon dissolution during sampling are potential interferents. Interferents for the halide measurements are the halogen gases which disproportionate to a hydrogen halide and a hydrohalous acid upon dissolution in water. However, the use of acidic rather than neutral or basic solutions for collection of the hydrogen halides greatly reduces the dissolution of any halogens passing through this solution.</P>
            <P>4.2 The simultaneous presence of HBr and CL<E T="52">2</E> may cause a positive bias in the HCL result with a corresponding negative bias in the Cl<E T="52">2</E> result as well as affecting the HBr/Br<E T="52">2</E> split.</P>
            <P>4.3 High concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO<E T="52">X</E>) may produce sufficient nitrate (NO<E T="52">3</E>
              <E T="51">−</E> to interfere with measurements of very low Br<E T="51">−</E> levels.</P>
            <P>4.4 A glass wool plug should <E T="03">not</E> be used to remove particulate matter since a negative bias in the data could result.</P>
            <P>4.5 There is anecdotal evidence that HF may be outgassed from new teflon components. If HF is a target analyte, then preconditioning of new teflon components, by heating should be considered.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 Safety</HD>
            <P>5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before performing this test method.</P>
            <P>5.2 Corrosive Reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal burns.</P>
            <P>5.2.1 Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). Causes severe damage to eyes and skin. Inhalation causes irritation to nose, throat, and lungs. Reacts exothermically with limited amounts of water.</P>
            <P>5.2.2 Sulfuric Acid (H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>). Rapidly destructive to body tissue. Will cause third degree burns. Eye damage may result in blindness. Inhalation may be fatal from spasm of the larynx, usually within 30 minutes. May cause lung tissue damage with edema. 1 mg/m<SU>3</SU> for 8 hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals and organics.</P>

            <P>7.1 Sampling.</P>
            <P>7.1.1 Filter. A 25-mm (1 in) (or other size) Teflon glass mat, Pallflex TX40HI75 (Pallflex Inc., 125 Kennedy Drive, Putnam, CT 06260). This filter is in a mat configuration to prevent fine particulate matter from entering the sampling train. Its composition is 75% Teflon/25% borosilicate glass. Other filters may be used, but they must be in a mat (as opposed to a laminate) configuration and contain at least 75% Teflon. For practical rather than scientific reasons, when the stack gas temperature exceeds 210 °C (410 °F) and the HCl concentration is greater than 20 ppm, a quartz-fiber filter may be used since Teflon becomes unstable above this temperature.</P>
            <P>7.1.2 Water. Deionized, distilled water that conforms to American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Specification D 1193-77 or 91, Type 3 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17).</P>
            <P>7.1.3 Acidic Absorbing Solution, 0.1 N Sulfuric Acid (H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>). To prepare 100 ml of the absorbing solution for the front impinger pair, slowly add 0.28 ml of concentrated H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> to about 90 ml of water while stirring, and adjust the final volume to 100 ml using additional water. Shake well to mix the solution.</P>
            <P>7.1.4 Silica Gel. Indicating type, 6 to 16 mesh. If previously used, dry at 180 °C (350 °F) for 2 hours. New silica gel may be used as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

            <P>7.1.5 Alkaline Adsorbing Solution, 0.1 N Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). To prepare 100 ml of the scrubber solution for the third and fourth impinger, dissolve 0.40 g of solid NaOH in about 90 ml of water, and adjust the final <PRTPAGE P="555"/>solution volume to 100 ml using additional water. Shake well to mix the solution.</P>
            <P>7.1.6 Sodium Thiosulfate (Na<E T="52">2</E>S<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">3</E> 5 H<E T="52">2</E>O)</P>
            <P>7.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis.</P>
            <P>7.2.1 Water. Same as in section 7.1.2.</P>
            <P>7.2.2 Absorbing Solution Blanks. A separate blank solution of each absorbing reagent should be prepared for analysis with the field samples. Dilute 30 ml of each absorbing solution to approximately the same final volume as the field samples using the blank sample of rinse water.</P>

            <P>7.2.3 Halide Salt Stock Standard Solutions. Prepare concentrated stock solutions from reagent grade sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium bromide (NaBr), and sodium fluoride (NaF). Each must be dried at 110 °C (230 °F) for two or more hours and then cooled to room temperature in a desiccator immediately before weighing. Accurately weigh 1.6 to 1.7 g of the dried NaCl to within 0.1 mg, dissolve in water, and dilute to 1 liter. Calculate the exact Cl<E T="51">−</E> concentration using Equation 26-1 in section 12.2. In a similar manner, accurately weigh and solubilize 1.2 to 1.3 g of dried NaBr and 2.2 to 2.3 g of NaF to make 1-liter solutions. Use Equations 26-2 and 26-3 in section 12.2, to calculate the Br<E T="51">−</E> and F<E T="51">−</E> concentrations. Alternately, solutions containing a nominal certified concentration of 1000 mg/l NaCl are commercially available as convenient stock solutions from which standards can be made by appropriate volumetric dilution. Refrigerate the stock standard solutions and store no longer than one month.</P>
            <P>7.2.4 Chromatographic Eluent. Effective eluents for nonsuppressed IC using a resin-or silica-based weak ion exchange column are a 4 mM potassium hydrogen phthalate solution, adjusted to pH 4.0 using a saturated sodium borate solution, and a 4 mM 4-hydroxy benzoate solution, adjusted to pH 8.6 using 1 N NaOH. An effective eluent for suppressed ion chromatography is a solution containing 3 mM sodium bicarbonate and 2.4 mM sodium carbonate. Other dilute solutions buffered to a similar pH and containing no interfering ions may be used. When using suppressed ion chromatography, if the “water dip” resulting from sample injection interferes with the chloride peak, use a 2 mM NaOH/2.4 mM sodium bicarbonate eluent.</P>

            <P>8.1 Sampling.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Preparation of Collection Train. Prepare the sampling train as follows: Pour 15 ml of the acidic absorbing solution into each one of the first pair of impingers, and 15 ml of the alkaline absorbing solution into each one of the second pair of impingers. Connect the impingers in series with the knockout impinger first, if used, followed by the two impingers containing the acidic absorbing solution and the two impingers containing the alkaline absorbing solution. Place a fresh charge of silica gel, or equivalent, in the drying tube or impinger at the end of the impinger train.</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Adjust the probe temperature and the temperature of the filter and the stopcock (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the heated area in Figure 26-1) to a temperature sufficient to prevent water condensation. This temperature must be maintained between 120 and 134 °C (248 and 273 °F). The temperature should be monitored throughout a sampling run to ensure that the desired temperature is maintained. It is important to maintain a temperature around the probe and filter in this range since it is extremely difficult to purge acid gases off these components. (These components are not quantitatively recovered and, hence, any collection of acid gases on these components would result in potential undereporting of these emissions. The applicable subparts may specify alternative higher temperatures.)</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Leak-Check Procedure.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.1 Sampling Train. A leak-check prior to the sampling run is optional; however, a leak-check after the sampling run is mandatory. The leak-check procedure is as follows: Temporarily attach a suitable [<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 0-40 cc/min (0-2.4 in<SU>3</SU>/min)] rotameter to the outlet of the dry gas meter and place a vacuum gauge at or near the probe inlet. Plug the probe inlet, pull a vacuum of at least 250 mm Hg (10 in. Hg), and note the flow rate as indicated by the rotameter. A leakage rate not in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate is acceptable.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Carefully release the probe inlet plug before turning off the pump.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>8.1.3.2 Pump. It is suggested (not mandatory) that the pump be leak-checked separately, either prior to or after the sampling run. If done prior to the sampling run, the pump leak-check shall precede the leak-check of the sampling train described immediately above; if done after the sampling run, the pump leak-check shall follow the train leak-check. To leak-check the pump, proceed as follows: Disconnect the drying tube from the probe-impinger assembly. Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to either the drying tube or pump, pull a vacuum of 250 mm (10 in) Hg, plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum should remain stable for at least 30 sec. Other leak-check procedures may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.<PRTPAGE P="556"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.1.4 Purge Procedure. Immediately before sampling, connect the purge line to the stopcock, and turn the stopcock to permit the purge pump to purge the probe (see Figure 1A of Figure 26-1). Turn on the purge pump, and adjust the purge rate to 2 liters/min (0.07 ft<SU>3</SU>/min). Purge for at least 5 minutes before sampling.</P>
            <P>8.1.5 Sample Collection. Turn on the sampling pump, pull a slight vacuum of approximately 25 mm Hg (1 in Hg) on the impinger train, and turn the stopcock to permit stack gas to be pulled through the impinger train (see Figure 1C of Figure 26-1). Adjust the sampling rate to 2 liters/min, as indicated by the rate meter, and maintain this rate to within 10 percent during the entire sampling run. Take readings of the dry gas meter volume and temperature, rate meter, and vacuum gauge at least once every five minutes during the run. A sampling time of one hour is recommended. Shorter sampling times may introduce a significant negative bias in the HCl concentration. At the conclusion of the sampling run, remove the train from the stack, cool, and perform a leak-check as described in section 8.1.3.1.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sample Recovery.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Disconnect the impingers after sampling. Quantitatively transfer the contents of the acid impingers and the knockout impinger, if used, to a leak-free storage bottle. Add the water rinses of each of these impingers and connecting glassware to the storage bottle.</P>

            <P>8.2.2 Repeat this procedure for the alkaline impingers and connecting glassware using a separate storage bottle. Add 25 mg of sodium thiosulfate per the product of ppm of halogen anticipated to be in the stack gas times the volume (dscm) of stack gas sampled (0.7 mg per ppm-dscf).

Add the same amount of sodium thiosulfate solution to the 0.1 N NaOH absorbing solution blank. Also, save a portion of the rinse water used to rinse the sampling train. Place each in a separate, prelabeled storage bottle. The sample storage bottles should be sealed, shaken to mix, and labeled. Mark the fluid level.</P>
            <P>8.3 Sample Preparation for Analysis. Note the liquid levels in the storage bottles and confirm on the analysis sheet whether or not leakage occurred during transport.

An example chromatogram from a non-suppressed system using a 150-mm Hamilton PRP-X100 anion column, a 2 ml/min flow rate of a 4 mM 4-hydroxy benzoate solution adjusted to a pH of 8.6 using 1 N NaOH, a 50 µl sample loop, and a conductivity detector set on 1.0 µS full scale is shown in Figure 26-2.</P>

            <P>11.1.2 Before sample analysis, establish a stable baseline. Next, inject a sample of water, and determine if any Cl<E T="51">−</E>, Br<E T="51">−</E>, or F<E T="51">−</E> appears in the chromatogram. If any of these ions are present, repeat the load/injection <PRTPAGE P="557"/>procedure until they are no longer present. Analysis of the acid and alkaline absorbing solution samples requires separate standard calibration curves; prepare each according to section 10.2. Ensure adequate baseline separation of the analyses.</P>

            <P>11.1.3 Between injections of the appropriate series of calibration standards, inject in duplicate the reagent blanks, quality control sample, and the field samples.

Use the mean response of the duplicate injections to determine the concentrations of the field samples and reagent blanks using the linear calibration curve. The values from duplicate injections should agree within 5 percent of their mean for the analysis to be valid. If the values of duplicate injections are not within 5 percent of the mean, the duplicate injections shall be repeated and all four values used to determine the average response. Dilute any sample and the blank with equal volumes of water if the concentration exceeds that of the highest standard.</P>

            <P>1.2 This method is applicable for determining emissions of hydrogen halides (HX) [HCl, HBr, and HF] and halogens (X<E T="52">2</E>) [Cl<E T="52">2</E> and Br<E T="52">2</E>] from stationary sources when specified by the applicable subpart. This method collects the emission sample isokinetically and is therefore particularly suited for sampling at sources, such as those controlled by wet scrubbers, emitting acid particulate matter (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> hydrogen halides dissolved in water droplets).</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 Principle. Gaseous and particulate pollutants are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and collected in an optional cyclone, on a filter, and in absorbing solutions. The cyclone collects any liquid droplets and is not necessary if the source emissions do not contain them; however, it is preferable to include the cyclone in the sampling train to protect the filter from any liquid present. The filter collects particulate matter including halide salts but is not routinely recovered or analyzed. Acidic and alkaline absorbing solutions collect the gaseous hydrogen halides and halogens, respectively. Following sampling of emissions containing liquid droplets, any halides/halogens dissolved in the liquid in the cyclone and on the filter are vaporized to gas and collected in the impingers by pulling conditioned ambient air through the sampling train. The hydrogen halides are solubilized in the acidic solution and form chloride (Cl<E T="51">−</E>), bromide (Br<E T="51">−</E>), <PRTPAGE P="561"/>and fluoride (F<E T="51">−</E>) ions. The halogens have a very low solubility in the acidic solution and pass through to the alkaline solution where they are hydrolyzed to form a proton (H<SU> + </SU>), the halide ion, and the hypohalous acid (HClO or HBrO). Sodium thiosulfate is added to the alkaline solution to assure reaction with the hypohalous acid to form a second halide ion such that 2 halide ions are formed for each molecule of halogen gas. The halide ions in the separate solutions are measured by ion chromatography (IC). If desired, the particulate matter recovered from the filter and the probe is analyzed following the procedures in Method 5.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>If the tester intends to use this sampling arrangement to sample concurrently for particulate matter, the alternative Teflon probe liner, cyclone, and filter holder should not be used. The Teflon filter support must be used. The tester must also meet the probe and filter temperature requirements of both sampling trains.</P>

            </HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>
            <P>4.1 Volatile materials, such as chlorine dioxide (ClO<E T="52">2</E>) and ammonium chloride (NH<E T="52">4</E>Cl), which produce halide ions upon dissolution during sampling are potential interferents. Interferents for the halide measurements are the halogen gases which disproportionate to a hydrogen halide and a hypohalous acid upon dissolution in water. The use of acidic rather than neutral or basic solutions for collection of the hydrogen halides greatly reduces the dissolution of any halogens passing through this solution.</P>
            <P>4.2 The simultaneous presence of both HBr and Cl<E T="52">2</E> may cause a positive bias in the HCl result with a corresponding negative bias in the Cl<E T="52">2</E> result as well as affecting the HBr/Br<E T="52">2</E> split.</P>
            <P>4.3 High concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO<E T="52">X</E>) may produce sufficient nitrate (NO<E T="52">3</E>
              <E T="51">−</E>) to interfere with measurements of very low Br<E T="51">−</E> levels. Dissociating chloride salts (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ammonium chloride) at elevated temperatures interfere with halogen acid measurement in this method. Maintaining particulate probe/filter temperatures between 120 °C and 134 °C (248 °F and 273 °F) minimizes this interference.</P>
            <P>4.4 There is anecdotal evidence that HF may be outgassed from new Teflon components. If HF is a target analyte then preconditioning of new Teflon components, by heating, should be considered.</P>

            <P>8.1 Sampling.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.1, except the filter need only be desiccated and weighed if a particulate determination will be conducted.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 5, section 8.2.</P>

            <P>8.1.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.1.3, except for the following variations: Add 50 ml of 0.1 N H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> to the condensate impinger, if used. Place 100 ml of 0.1 N H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E> in each of the next two impingers. Place 100 ml of 0.1 N NaOH in each of the following two impingers. Finally, transfer approximately 200-300 g of preweighed silica gel from its container to the last impinger. Set up the train as in Figure 26A-1. When used, the optional cyclone is inserted between the probe liner and filter holder and located in the heated filter box.</P>
            <P>8.1.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Follow the leak-check procedures given in Method 5, sections 8.4.2 (Pretest Leak-Check), 8.4.3 (Leak-Checks During the Sample Run), and 8.4.4 (Post-Test Leak-Check).</P>
            <P>8.1.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the general procedure given in Method 5, Section 8.5. It is important to maintain a temperature around the probe, filter (and cyclone, if used) between 120 and 134 °C (248 and 273 °F) since it is extremely difficult to purge acid gases off these components. (These components are not quantitatively recovered and hence any collection of acid gases on these components would result in potential undereporting these emissions. The applicable subparts may specify alternative higher temperatures.) For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Method 5, Figure 5-3. If the condensate impinger becomes too full, it may be emptied, recharged with 50 ml of 0.1 N H2SO4, and replaced during the sample run. The condensate emptied must be saved and included in the measurement of the volume of moisture collected and included in the sample for analysis. The additional 50 ml of absorbing reagent must also be considered in calculating the moisture. Before the sampling train integrity is compromised by removing the impinger, conduct a leak-check as described in Method 5, Section 8.4.2.</P>

            <P>8.1.6 Post-Test Moisture Removal (Optional). When the optional cyclone is included in the sampling train or when liquid is visible on the filter at the end of a sample run even in the absence of a cyclone, perform the following procedure. Upon completion of the test run, connect the ambient air conditioning tube at the probe inlet and operate the train with the filter heating system between 120 and 134 °C (248 and 273 °F) at a low flow rate (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ΔH = 1 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O) to vaporize any liquid and hydrogen halides in the cyclone or on the filter and pull them through the train into the impingers. After 30 minutes, turn off the flow, remove the conditioning tube, and examine the cyclone and filter for any visible liquid. If liquid is visible, repeat this step for 15 minutes and observe again. Keep repeating until the cyclone is dry.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>It is critical that this procedure is repeated until the cyclone is completely dry.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>8.2 Sample Recovery. Allow the probe to cool. When the probe can be handled safely, wipe off all the external surfaces of the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap loosely over the tip to prevent gaining or losing particulate matter. Do not cap the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling down because this will create a vacuum in the filter holder, drawing water from the impingers into the holder. Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sample train, wipe off any silicone grease, and cap the open outlet of the impinger train, being careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Wipe off <PRTPAGE P="564"/>any silicone grease and cap the filter or cyclone inlet. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used between the first impinger and the filter holder, disconnect it at the filter holder and let any condensed water drain into the first impinger. Wipe off any silicone grease and cap the filter holder outlet and the impinger inlet. Ground glass stoppers, plastic caps, serum caps, Teflon tape, Parafilm, or aluminum foil may be used to close these openings. Transfer the probe and filter/impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the weather to minimize sample contamination or loss. Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and note any abnormal conditions. Treat samples as follows:</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Container No. 1 (Optional; Filter Catch for Particulate Determination). Same as Method 5, section 8.7.6.1, Container No. 1.</P>

            <P>8.2.3 Container No. 3 (Knockout and Acid Impinger Catch for Moisture and Hydrogen Halide Determination). Disconnect the impingers. Measure the liquid in the acid and knockout impingers to ±1 ml by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to ±0.5 g by using a balance. Record the volume or weight of liquid present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. Quantitatively transfer this liquid to a leak-free sample storage container. Rinse these impingers and connecting glassware including the back portion of the filter holder (and flexible tubing, if used) with water and add these rinses to the storage container. Seal the container, shake to mix, and label. The fluid level should be marked so that if any sample is lost during transport, a correction proportional to the lost volume can be applied. Retain rinse water and acidic absorbing solution blanks to be analyzed with the samples.</P>

            <P>8.2.4 Container No. 4 (Alkaline Impinger Catch for Halogen and Moisture Determination). Measure and record the liquid in the alkaline impingers as described in section 8.2.3. Quantitatively transfer this liquid to a leak-free sample storage container. Rinse these two impingers and connecting glassware with water and add these rinses to the container. Add 25 mg of sodium thiosulfate per ppm halogen anticipated to be in the stack gas multiplied by the volume (dscm) of stack gas sampled (0.7 mg/ppm-dscf). Seal the container, shake to mix, and label; mark the fluid level. Retain alkaline absorbing solution blank to be analyzed with the samples.

            <P>6.2 Regulator. Low pressure regulator for controlling pressurization of the delivery tank.</P>

            <P>8.1 Pretest Preparations.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 Summary. Testing problems may occur due to the presence of volatile vapors and/or temperature fluctuations inside the delivery tank. Under these conditions, it is often difficult to obtain a stable initial pressure at the beginning of a test, and erroneous test results may occur. To help prevent this, it is recommended that prior to testing, volatile vapors be removed from the tank and the temperature inside the tank be allowed to stabilize. Because it is not always possible to completely attain these pretest conditions, a provision to ensure reproducible results is included. The difference in results for two consecutive runs must meet the criteria in sections 8.2.2.5 and 8.2.3.5.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Emptying of Tank. The delivery tank shall be emptied of all liquid.</P>

            <P>8.1.3 Purging of Vapor. As much as possible the delivery tank shall be purged of all volatile vapors by any safe, acceptable method. One method is to carry a load of non-volatile liquid fuel, such as diesel or heating oil, immediately prior to the test, thus flushing out all the volatile gasoline vapors. A second method is to remove the volatile vapors by blowing ambient air into each tank compartment for at least 20 minutes. This second method is usually not as effective and often causes stabilization problems, requiring a <PRTPAGE P="569"/>much longer time for stabilization during the testing.</P>
            <P>8.1.4 Temperature Stabilization. As much as possible, the test shall be conducted under isothermal conditions. The temperature of the delivery tank should be allowed to equilibrate in the test environment. During the test, the tank should be protected from extreme environmental and temperature variability, such as direct sunlight.</P>
            <P>8.2 Test Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Preparations.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.1 Open and close each dome cover.</P>

            <P>8.2.1.2 Connect static electrical ground connections to the tank. Attach the liquid delivery and vapor return hoses, remove the liquid delivery elbows, and plug the liquid delivery fittings.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The purpose of testing the liquid delivery hoses is to detect tears or holes that would allow liquid leakage during a delivery. Liquid delivery hoses are not considered to be possible sources of vapor leakage, and thus, do not have to be attached for a vapor leakage test. Instead, a liquid delivery hose could be either visually inspected, or filled with water to detect any liquid leakage.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.2.1.3 Attach the test cap to the end of the vapor recovery hose.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.4 Connect the pressure-vacuum supply hose and the pressure-vacuum relief valve to the shut-off valve. Attach a manometer to the pressure tap.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.5 Connect compartments of the tank internally to each other if possible. If not possible, each compartment must be tested separately, as if it were an individual delivery tank.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Pressure Test.</P>
            <P>8.2.2.1 Connect the pressure source to the pressure-vacuum supply hose.</P>

            <P>8.2.2.2 Open the shut-off valve in the vapor recovery hose cap. Apply air pressure slowly, pressurize the tank to P<E T="52">i</E>, the initial pressure specified in the regulation.</P>

            <P>8.2.2.3 Close the shut-off and allow the pressure in the tank to stabilize, adjusting the pressure if necessary to maintain pressure of P<E T="52">i</E>. When the pressure stabilizes, record the time and initial pressure.</P>
            <P>8.2.2.4 At the end of the time period (t) specified in the regulation, record the time and final pressure.</P>

            <P>8.2.2.5 Repeat steps 8.2.2.2 through 8.2.2.4 until the change in pressure for two consecutive runs agrees within 12.5 mm (0.5 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>O. Calculate the arithmetic average of the two results.</P>
            <P>8.2.2.6 Compare the average measured change in pressure to the allowable pressure change, Δp, specified in the regulation. If the delivery tank does not satisfy the vapor tightness criterion specified in the regulation, repair the sources of leakage, and repeat the pressure test until the criterion is met.</P>
            <P>8.2.2.7 Disconnect the pressure source from the pressure-vacuum supply hose, and slowly open the shut-off valve to bring the tank to atmospheric pressure.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Vacuum Test.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1 Connect the vacuum source to the pressure-vacuum supply hose.</P>

            <P>8.2.3.2 Open the shut-off valve in the vapor recovery hose cap. Slowly evacuate the tank to V<E T="52">i</E>, the initial vacuum specified in the regulation.</P>

            <P>8.2.3.3 Close the shut-off valve and allow the pressure in the tank to stabilize, adjusting the pressure if necessary to maintain a vacuum of V<E T="52">i</E>. When the pressure stabilizes, record the time and initial vacuum.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.4 At the end of the time period specified in the regulation (t), record the time and final vacuum.</P>

            <P>8.2.3.5 Repeat steps 8.2.3.2 through 8.2.3.4 until the change in vacuum for two consecutive runs agrees within 12.5 mm (0.5 in.) H<E T="52">2</E>O. Calculate the arithmetic average of the two results.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.6 Compare the average measured change in vacuum to the allowable vacuum change, Δv, as specified in the regulation. If the delivery tank does not satisfy the vapor tightness criterion specified in the regulation, repair the sources of leakage, and repeat the vacuum test until the criterion is met.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.7 Disconnect the vacuum source from the pressure-vacuum supply hose, and slowly open the shut-off valve to bring the tank to atmospheric pressure.</P>

            <P>8.1.1.1 Maximum Burn Rate. For Category 4, the wood heater shall be operated with the primary air supply inlet controls fully open (or, if thermostatically controlled, the thermostat shall be set at maximum heat output) during the entire test run, or the maximum burn rate setting specified by the manufacturer's written instructions.</P>
            <P>8.1.1.2 Other Burn Rate Categories. For burn rates in Categories 1 through 3, the wood heater shall be operated with the primary air supply inlet control, or other mechanical control device, set at a predetermined position necessary to obtain the average burn rate required for the category.</P>
            <P>8.1.1.3 Alternative Burn Rates for Burn Rate Categories 1 and 2.</P>
            <P>8.1.1.3.1 If a wood heater cannot be operated at a burn rate below 0.80 kg/hr (1.76 lb/hr), two test runs shall be conducted with burn rates within Category 2. If a wood heater cannot be operated at a burn rate below 1.25 kg/hr (2.76 lb/hr), the flue shall be dampered or the air supply otherwise controlled in order to achieve two test runs within Category 2.</P>

            <P>8.1.1.3.2 Evidence that a wood heater cannot be operated at a burn rate less than 0.80 kg/hr shall include documentation of two or more attempts to operate the wood heater in burn rate Category 1 and fuel combustion has stopped, or results of two or more test runs demonstrating that the burn rates were greater than 0.80 kg/hr when the air supply controls were adjusted to the lowest possible position or settings. Stopped fuel combustion is evidenced when an elapsed time of 30 minutes or more has occurred without a measurable (&lt;0.05 kg (0.1 lb) or 1.0 percent, whichever is greater) weight change in the test fuel charge. See also section 8.8.3. Report the evidence and the reasoning used to determine that a test in burn rate Category 1 cannot be achieved; for example, two unsuccessful attempts to operate at a burn rate of 0.4 kg/hr are not sufficient evidence that burn rate Category 1 cannot be achieved.

            <P>8.2 Catalytic Combustor and Wood Heater Aging. The catalyst-equipped wood heater or a wood heater of any type shall be aged before the certification test begins. The aging procedure shall be conducted and documented by a testing laboratory accredited according to procedures in § 60.535 of 40 CFR part 60.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Catalyst-equipped Wood Heater. Operate the catalyst-equipped wood heater using fuel meeting the specifications outlined in sections 7.1.1 through 7.1.3, or cordwood with a moisture content between 15 and 25 percent on a wet basis. Operate the wood heater at a medium burn rate (Category 2 or 3) with a new catalytic combustor in place and in operation for at least 50 hours. Record and report hourly catalyst exit temperature data (Section 8.6.2) and the hours of operation.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Non-Catalyst Wood Heater. Operate the wood heater using the fuel described in section 8.4.1 at a medium burn rate for at least 10 hours. Record and report the hours of operation.</P>
            <P>8.3 Pretest Recordkeeping. Record the test fuel charge dimensions and weights, and wood heater and catalyst descriptions as shown in the example in Figure 28-1.</P>
            <P>8.4 Wood Heater Installation. Assemble the wood heater appliance and parts in conformance with the manufacturer's written installation instructions. Place the wood heater centrally on the platform scale and connect the wood heater to the flue described in section 6.11. Clean the flue with an appropriately sized, wire chimney brush before each certification test.</P>
            <P>8.5 Wood Heater Temperature Monitors.</P>
            <P>8.5.1 For catalyst-equipped wood heaters, locate a temperature monitor (optional) about 25 mm (1 in.) upstream of the catalyst at the centroid of the catalyst face area, and locate a temperature monitor (mandatory) that will indicate the catalyst exhaust temperature. This temperature monitor is centrally located within 25 mm (1 in.) downstream at the centroid of catalyst face area. Record these locations.</P>

            <P>8.5.2 Locate wood heater surface temperature monitors at five locations on the wood heater firebox exterior surface. Position the temperature monitors centrally on the top surface, on two sidewall surfaces, and on the bottom and back surfaces. Position the monitor sensing tip on the firebox exterior surface inside of any heat shield, air circulation walls, or other wall or shield separated from the firebox exterior surface. Surface temperature locations for unusual design shapes (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> spherical, etc.) shall be positioned so that there are four surface temperature monitors in both the vertical and horizontal planes passing at right angles through the centroid of the firebox, not including the fuel loading door (total of five temperature monitors).</P>
            <P>8.6 Test Facility Conditions.</P>
            <P>8.6.1 Locate the test facility temperature monitor on the horizontal plane that includes the primary air intake opening for the wood heater. Locate the temperature monitor 1 to 2 m (3 to 6 ft) from the front of the wood heater in the 90° sector in front of the wood heater.</P>
            <P>8.6.2 Use an anemometer to measure the air velocity. Measure and record the room air velocity before the pretest ignition period (Section 8.7) and once immediately following the test run completion.</P>
            <P>8.6.3 Measure and record the test facility's ambient relative humidity, barometric pressure, and temperature before and after each test run.</P>
            <P>8.6.4 Measure and record the flue draft or static pressure in the flue at a location no greater than 0.3 m (1 ft) above the flue connector at the wood heater exhaust during the test run at the recording intervals (Section 8.8.2).</P>
            <P>8.7 Wood Heater Firebox Volume.</P>
            <P>8.7.1 Determine the firebox volume using the definitions for height, width, and length in section 3. Volume adjustments due to presence of firebrick and other permanent fixtures may be necessary. Adjust width and length dimensions to extend to the metal wall of the wood heater above the firebrick or permanent obstruction if the firebrick or obstruction extending the length of the side(s) or back wall extends less than one-third of the usable firebox height. Use the width or length dimensions inside the firebrick if the firebrick extends more than one-third of the usable firebox height. If a log retainer or grate is a permanent fixture and the manufacturer recommends that no fuel be placed outside the retainer, the area outside of the retainer is excluded from the firebox volume calculations.</P>
            <P>8.7.2 In general, exclude the area above the ash lip if that area is less than 10 percent of the usable firebox volume. Otherwise, take into account consumer loading practices. For instance, if fuel is to be loaded front-to-back, an ash lip may be considered usable firebox volume.</P>

            <P>8.7.3 Include areas adjacent to and above a baffle (up to two inches above the fuel loading opening) if four inches or more horizontal space exist between the edge of the baffle and a vertical obstruction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sidewalls or air channels).</P>
            <P>8.8 Test Fuel Charge.</P>

            <P>8.8.1 Prepare the test fuel pieces in accordance with the specifications outlined in sections 7.1 and 7.2. Determine the test fuel moisture content with a calibrated electrical <PRTPAGE P="574"/>resistance meter or other equivalent performance meter. If necessary, convert fuel moisture content values from dry basis (%M<E T="52">d</E>) to wet basis (%M<E T="52">w</E>) in section 12.2 using Equation 28-1. Determine fuel moisture for each fuel piece (not including spacers) by averaging at least three moisture meter readings, one from each of three sides, measured parallel to the wood grain. Average all the readings for all the fuel pieces in the test fuel charge. If an electrical resistance type meter is used, penetration of insulated electrodes shall be one-fourth the thickness of the test fuel piece or 19 mm (0.75 in.), whichever is greater. Measure the moisture content within a 4-hour period prior to the test run. Determine the fuel temperature by measuring the temperature of the room where the wood has been stored for at least 24 hours prior to the moisture determination.</P>
            <P>8.8.2 Attach the spacers to the test fuel pieces with uncoated, ungalvanized nails or staples as illustrated in Figure 28-2. Attachment of spacers to the top of the test fuel piece(s) on top of the test fuel charge is optional.</P>
            <P>8.8.3 To avoid stacking difficulties, or when a whole number of test fuel pieces does not result, all piece lengths shall be adjusted uniformly to remain within the specified loading density. The shape of the test fuel crib shall be geometrically similar to the shape of the firebox volume without resorting to special angular or round cuts on the individual fuel pieces.</P>

            <P>8.8.4 The test fuel loading density shall be 112 ±11.2 kg/m<SU>3</SU> (7 ±0.7 lb/ft<E T="53">3</E>) of usable firebox volume on a wet basis.</P>

            <P>8.9 Sampling Equipment. Prepare the sampling equipment as defined by the selected method (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> either Method 5G or Method 5H). Collect one particulate emission sample for each test run.</P>
            <P>8.10 Secondary Air Adjustment Validation.</P>
            <P>8.10.1 If design drawings do not show the introduction of secondary air into a chamber outside the firebox (see “secondary air supply” under section 3.0, Definitions), conduct a separate test of the wood heater's secondary air supply. Operate the wood heater at a burn rate in Category 1 (Section 8.1.1) with the secondary air supply operated following the manufacturer's written instructions. Start the secondary air validation test run as described in section 8.8.1, except no emission sampling is necessary and burn rate data shall be recorded at 5-minute intervals.</P>
            <P>8.10.2 After the start of the test run, operate the wood heater with the secondary air supply set as per the manufacturer's instructions, but with no adjustments to this setting. After 25 percent of the test fuel has been consumed, adjust the secondary air supply controls to another setting, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Record the burn rate data (5-minute intervals) for 20 minutes following the air supply adjustment.</P>
            <P>8.10.3 Adjust the air supply control(s) to the original position(s), operate at this condition for at least 20 minutes, and repeat the air supply adjustment procedure above. Repeat the procedure three times at equal intervals over the entire burn period as defined in section 8.8. If the secondary air adjustment results in a burn rate change of more than an average of 25 percent between the 20-minute periods before and after the secondary adjustments, the secondary air supply shall be considered a primary air supply, and no adjustment to this air supply is allowed during the test run.</P>

            <P>8.10.4 The example sequence below describes a typical secondary air adjustment validation check. The first cycle begins after at least 25 percent of the test fuel charge has been consumed.

            <P>8.11 Pretest Ignition. Build a fire in the wood heater in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions.</P>
            <P>8.11.1 Pretest Fuel Charge. Crumpled newspaper loaded with kindling may be used to help ignite the pretest fuel. The pretest fuel, used to sustain the fire, shall meet the same fuel requirements prescribed in section 7.1. The pretest fuel charge shall consist of whole 2 × 4's that are no less than <FR>1/3</FR> the length of the test fuel pieces. Pieces of 4 × 4 lumber in approximately the same weight ratio as for the test fuel charge may be added to the pretest fuel charge.</P>

            <P>8.11.2 Wood Heater Operation and Adjustments. Set the air inlet supply controls at any position that will maintain combustion of the pretest fuel load. At least one hour before the start of the test run, set the air supply controls at the approximate positions necessary to achieve the burn rate desired for the test run. Adjustment of the air supply controls, fuel addition or subtractions, and coalbed raking shall be kept to a minimum but are allowed up to 15 minutes prior to the start of the test run. For the purposes of this method, coalbed raking is the use of a metal tool (poker) to stir coals, break burning fuel into smaller pieces, dislodge fuel pieces from positions of poor combustion, and check for the condition of uniform charcoalization. Record all adjustments made to the air supply controls, adjustments to and additions or subtractions of fuel, and any other changes to wood heater operations that occur during pretest ignition period. Record fuel weight data and wood heater temperature measurements at 10-minute intervals during the hour of the pretest ignition period preceding the start of the test run. During the 15-minute period prior to the start of the test run, the wood heater loading door shall not be open more than a total of 1 minute. Coalbed raking is the only adjustment allowed during this period.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

              <P>One purpose of the pretest ignition period is to achieve uniform charcoalization of the test fuel bed prior to loading the test fuel charge. Uniform charcoalization is a general condition of the test fuel bed evidenced by an absence of large pieces of burning wood in the coal bed and the remaining fuel pieces being brittle enough to be broken into smaller charcoal pieces with a metal poker. Manipulations to the fuel bed prior to the start of the test run should be done to achieve uniform charcoalization while maintaining the desired burn rate. In addition, some wood heaters (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> high mass units) may require extended pretest burn time and fuel additions to reach an initial average surface temperature sufficient to meet the thermal equilibrium criteria in section 8.3.</P>

            <P>8.11.3 The weight of pretest fuel remaining at the start of the test run is determined as the difference between the weight of the wood heater with the remaining pretest fuel and the tare weight of the cleaned, dry wood heater with or without dry ash or sand added consistent with the manufacturer's instructions and the owner's manual. The tare weight of the wood heater must be determined with the wood heater (and ash, if added) in a dry condition.</P>
            <P>8.12 Test Run. Complete a test run in each burn rate category, as follows:</P>
            <P>8.12.1 Test Run Start.</P>

            <P>8.12.1.1 When the kindling and pretest fuel have been consumed to leave a fuel weight between 20 and 25 percent of the weight of the test fuel charge, record the weight of the fuel remaining and start the test run. Record and report any other criteria, in addition to those specified in this section, used to determine the moment of the test run start (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> firebox or catalyst temperature), whether such criteria are specified by the wood heater manufacturer or the testing laboratory. Record all wood heater individual surface temperatures, catalyst temperatures, any initial sampling method measurement values, and begin the particulate emission sampling. Within 1 minute following the start of the test run, open the wood heater door, load the test fuel charge, and record the test fuel charge weight. Recording of average, rather than individual, surface temperatures is acceptable for tests conducted in accordance with § 60.533(o)(3)(i) of 40 CFR part 60.</P>
            <P>8.12.1.2 Position the fuel charge so that the spacers are parallel to the floor of the firebox, with the spacer edges abutting each other. If loading difficulties result, some fuel pieces may be placed on edge. If the usable firebox volume is between 0.043 and 0.085 m<SU>3</SU> (1.5 and 3.0 ft<SU>3</SU>), alternate the piece sizes in vertical stacking layers to the extent possible. For example, place 2 × 4's on the bottom layer in direct contact with the coal bed and 4 × 4's on the next layer, etc. (See Figure 28-3). Position the fuel pieces parallel to each other and parallel to the longest wall of the firebox to the extent possible within the specifications in section 8.8.</P>
            <P>8.12.1.3 Load the test fuel in appliances having unusual or unconventional firebox design maintaining air space intervals between the test fuel pieces and in conformance with the manufacturer's written instructions. For any appliance that will not accommodate the loading arrangement specified in the paragraph above, the test facility personnel shall contact the Administrator for an alternative loading arrangement.</P>

            <P>8.12.1.4 The wood heater door may remain open and the air supply controls adjusted up to five minutes after the start of the test run in order to make adjustments to the test fuel charge and to ensure ignition of the test fuel charge has occurred. Within the five minutes after the start of the test run, close the wood heater door and adjust the air supply controls to the position determined to produce <PRTPAGE P="576"/>the desired burn rate. No other adjustments to the air supply controls or the test fuel charge are allowed (except as specified in sections 8.12.3 and 8.12.4) after the first five minutes of the test run. Record the length of time the wood heater door remains open, the adjustments to the air supply controls, and any other operational adjustments.</P>

            <P>8.12.2 Data Recording. Record on a data sheet similar to that shown in Figure 28-4, at intervals no greater than 10 minutes, fuel weight data, wood heater individual surface and catalyst temperature measurements, other wood heater operational data (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> draft), test facility temperature and sampling method data.</P>

            <P>8.12.3 Test Fuel Charge Adjustment. The test fuel charge may be adjusted (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> repositioned) once during a test run if more than 60 percent of the initial test fuel charge weight has been consumed and more than 10 minutes have elapsed without a measurable (&lt;0.05 kg (0.1 lb) or 1.0 percent, whichever is greater) weight change. The time used to make this adjustment shall be less than 15 seconds.</P>
            <P>8.12.4 Air Supply Adjustment. Secondary air supply controls may be adjusted once during the test run following the manufacturer's written instructions (see section 8.10). No other air supply adjustments are allowed during the test run. Recording of wood heater flue draft during the test run is optional for tests conducted in accordance with § 60.533(o)(3)(i) of 40 CFR part 60.</P>
            <P>8.12.5 Auxiliary Wood Heater Equipment Operation. Heat exchange blowers sold with the wood heater shall be operated during the test run following the manufacturer's written instructions. If no manufacturer's written instructions are available, operate the heat exchange blower in the “high” position. (Automatically operated blowers shall be operated as designed.) Shaker grates, by-pass controls, or other auxiliary equipment may be adjusted only one time during the test run following the manufacturer's written instructions.</P>

            <P>Record all adjustments on a wood heater operational written record.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>If the wood heater is sold with a heat exchange blower as an option, test the wood heater with the heat exchange blower operating as described in sections 8.1 through 8.12 and report the results. As an alternative to repeating all test runs without the heat exchange blower operating, one additional test run may be without the blower operating as described in section 8.12.5 at a burn rate in Category 2 (Section 8.1.1). If the emission rate resulting from this test run without the blower operating is equal to or less than the emission rate plus 1.0 g/hr (0.0022 lb/hr) for the test run in burn rate Category 2 with the blower operating, the wood heater may be considered to have the same average emission rate with or without the blower operating. Additional test runs without the blower operating are unnecessary.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.13 Test Run Completion. Continue emission sampling and wood heater operation for 2 hours. The test run is completed when the remaining weight of the test fuel charge is 0.00 kg (0.0 lb). End the test run when the scale has indicated a test fuel charge weight of 0.00 kg (0.0 lb) or less for 30 seconds. At the end of the test run, stop the particulate sampling, and record the final fuel weight, the run time, and all final measurement values.</P>
            <P>8.14 Wood Heater Thermal Equilibrium. The average of the wood heater surface temperatures at the end of the test run shall agree with the average surface temperature at the start of the test run to within 70 °C (126 °F).</P>
            <P>8.15 Consecutive Test Runs. Test runs on a wood heater may be conducted consecutively provided that a minimum one-hour interval occurs between test runs.</P>
            <P>8.16 Additional Test Runs. The testing laboratory may conduct more than one test run in each of the burn rate categories specified in section 8.1.1. If more than one test run is conducted at a specified burn rate, the results from at least two-thirds of the test runs in that burn rate category shall be used in calculating the weighted average emission rate (see section 12.2). The measurement data and results of all test runs shall be reported regardless of which values are used in calculating the weighted average emission rate (see note in section 8.1).</P>

            <P>16.1 Pellet Burning Heaters. Certification testing requirements and procedures for pellet burning wood heaters are identical to those for other wood heaters, with the following exceptions:</P>
            <P>16.1.1 Test Fuel Properties. The test fuel shall be all wood pellets with a moisture content no greater than 20 percent on a wet basis (25 percent on a dry basis). Determine the wood moisture content with either ASTM D 2016-74 or 83, (Method A), ASTM D 4444-92, or ASTM D 4442-84 or 92 (all noted ASTM standards are incorporated by reference—see § 60.17).</P>
            <P>16.1.2 Test Fuel Charge Specifications. The test fuel charge size shall be as per the manufacturer's written instructions for maintaining the desired burn rate.</P>
            <P>16.1.3 Wood Heater Firebox Volume. The firebox volume need not be measured or determined for establishing the test fuel charge size. The firebox dimensions and other heater specifications needed to identify the heater for certification purposes shall be reported.</P>
            <P>16.1.4 Heater Installation. Arrange the heater with the fuel supply hopper on the platform scale as described in section 8.6.1.</P>
            <P>16.1.5 Pretest Ignition. Start a fire in the heater as directed by the manufacturer's written instructions, and adjust the heater controls to achieve the desired burn rate. Operate the heater at the desired burn rate for at least 1 hour before the start of the test run.</P>
            <P>16.1.6 Test Run. Complete a test run in each burn rate category as follows:</P>
            <P>16.1.6.1 Test Run Start. When the wood heater has operated for at least 1 hour at the desired burn rate, add fuel to the supply hopper as necessary to complete the test run, record the weight of the fuel in the supply hopper (the wood heater weight), and start the test run. Add no additional fuel to the hopper during the test run.</P>
            <P>Record all the wood heater surface temperatures, the initial sampling method measurement values, the time at the start of the test, and begin the emission sampling. Make no adjustments to the wood heater air supply or wood supply rate during the test run.</P>
            <P>16.1.6.2 Data Recording. Record the fuel (wood heater) weight data, wood heater temperature and operational data, and emission sampling data as described in section 8.12.2.</P>
            <P>16.1.6.3 Test Run Completion. Continue emission sampling and wood heater operation for 2 hours. At the end of the test run, stop the particulate sampling, and record the final fuel weight, the run time, and all final measurement values, including all wood heater individual surface temperatures.</P>
            <P>16.1.7 Calculations. Determine the burn rate using the difference between the initial and final fuel (wood heater) weights and the procedures described in section 12.4. Complete the other calculations as described in section 12.0.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 A gas sample is extracted from a location in the stack of a wood-fired appliance while the appliance is operating at a prescribed set of conditions. The gas sample is analyzed for carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>), oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>), and carbon monoxide (CO). These stack gas components are measured for determining the dry molecular weight of the exhaust gas. Total moles of exhaust gas are determined stoichiometrically. Air-to-fuel ratio is determined by relating the mass of dry combustion air to the mass of dry fuel consumed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions</HD>
            <P>Same as Method 28, section 3.0, with the addition of the following:</P>
            <P>3.1 Air-to-fuel ratio means the ratio of the mass of dry combustion air introduced into the firebox to the mass of dry fuel consumed (grams of dry air per gram of dry wood burned).</P>

            <P>8.1 Wood Heater Air Supply Adjustments.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 This section describes how dampers are to be set or adjusted and air inlet ports closed or sealed during Method 28A tests. The specifications in this section are intended to ensure that affected facility determinations are made on the facility configurations that could reasonably be expected to be employed by the user. They are also intended to prevent circumvention of the standard through the addition of an air port that would often be blocked off in actual use. These specifications are based on the assumption that consumers will remove such items as dampers or other closure mechanism stops if this can be done readily with household tools; that consumers will block air inlet passages not visible during normal operation of the appliance using aluminum tape or parts generally available at retail stores; and that consumers will cap off any threaded or flanged air inlets. They also assume that air leakage around glass doors, sheet metal joints or through inlet grilles visible during normal operation of the appliance would not be further blocked or taped off by a consumer.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 It is not the intention of this section to cause an appliance that is clearly designed, intended, and, in most normal installations, used as a fireplace to be converted into a wood heater for purposes of applicability testing. Such a fireplace would be identifiable by such features as large or multiple glass doors or panels that are not gasketed, relatively unrestricted air inlets intended, in large part, to limit smoking and fogging of glass surfaces, and other aesthetic features not normally included in wood heaters.</P>

            <P>8.1.3 Adjustable Air Supply Mechanisms. Any commercially available flue damper, other adjustment mechanism or other air <PRTPAGE P="585"/>inlet port that is designed, intended or otherwise reasonably expected to be adjusted or closed by consumers, installers, or dealers and which could restrict air into the firebox shall be set so as to achieve minimum air into the firebox (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> closed off or set in the most closed position).</P>
            <P>8.1.3.1 Flue dampers, mechanisms and air inlet ports which could reasonably be expected to be adjusted or closed would include:</P>
            <P>8.1.3.1.1 All internal or externally adjustable mechanisms (including adjustments that affect the tightness of door fittings) that are accessible either before and/or after installation.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.1.2 All mechanisms, other inlet ports, or inlet port stops that are identified in the owner's manual or in any dealer literature as being adjustable or alterable. For example, an inlet port that could be used to provide access to an outside air duct but which is identified as being closable through use of additional materials whether or not they are supplied with the facility.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.1.3 Any combustion air inlet port or commercially available flue damper or mechanism stop, which would readily lend itself to closure by consumers who are handy with household tools by the removal of parts or the addition of parts generally available at retail stores (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> addition of a pipe cap or plug, addition of a small metal plate to an inlet hole on a nondecorative sheet metal surface, or removal of riveted or screwed damper stops).</P>

            <P>8.1.3.1.4 Any flue damper, other adjustment mechanisms or other air inlet ports that are found and documented in several (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a number sufficient to reasonably conclude that the practice is not unique or uncommon) actual installations as having been adjusted to a more closed position, or closed by consumers, installers, or dealers.</P>

            <P>8.1.4 Air Supply Adjustments During Test. The test shall be performed with all air inlets identified under this section in the closed or most closed position or in the configuration which otherwise achieves the lowest air inlet (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> greatest blockage).
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>For the purposes of this section, air flow shall not be minimized beyond the point necessary to maintain combustion or beyond the point that forces smoke into the room.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>8.1.5 Notwithstanding section 8.1.1, any flue damper, adjustment mechanism, or air inlet port (whether or not equipped with flue dampers or adjusting mechanisms) that is visible during normal operation of the appliance and which could not reasonably be closed further or blocked except through means that would significantly degrade the aesthetics of the facility (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> through use of duct tape) will not be closed further or blocked.</P>
            <P>8.2 Sampling System.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Sampling Location. Same as Method 5H, section 8.1.2.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Sampling System Set Up. Set up the sampling equipment as described in Method 3, section 8.1.</P>
            <P>8.3 Wood Heater Installation, Test Facility Conditions, Wood Heater Firebox Volume, and Test Fuel Charge. Same as Method 28, sections 8.4 and 8.6 to 8.8, respectively.</P>
            <P>8.4 Pretest Ignition. Same as Method 28, section 8.11. Set the wood heater air supply settings to achieve a burn rate in Category 1 or the lowest achievable burn rate (see section 8.1).</P>
            <P>8.5 Test Run. Same as Method 28, section 8.12. Begin sample collection at the start of the test run as defined in Method 28, section 8.12.1.</P>
            <P>8.5.1 Gas Analysis.</P>
            <P>8.5.1.1 If Method 3 is used, collect a minimum of two bag samples simultaneously at a constant sampling rate for the duration of the test run. A minimum sample volume of 30 liters (1.1 ft<SU>3</SU>) per bag is recommended.</P>
            <P>8.5.1.2 If instrumental gas concentration measurement procedures are used, conduct the gas measurement system performance tests, analyzer calibration, and analyzer calibration error check outlined in Method 6C, sections 8.2.3, 8.2.4, 8.5, and 10.0, respectively. Sample at a constant rate for the duration of the test run.</P>
            <P>8.5.2 Data Recording. Record wood heater operational data, test facility temperature, sample train flow rate, and fuel weight data at intervals of no greater than 10 minutes.</P>
            <P>8.5.3 Test Run Completion. Same as Method 28, section 8.13.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.0 Quality Control</HD>
            <P>9.1 Data Validation. The following quality control procedure is suggested to provide a check on the quality of the data.</P>
            <P>9.1.1 Calculate a fuel factor, F<E T="52">o</E>, using Equation 28A-1 in section 12.2.</P>

            <P>9.1.2 If CO is present in quantities measurable by this method, adjust the O<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> values before performing the calculation for F<E T="52">o</E> as shown in section 12.3 and 12.4.</P>
            <P>9.1.3 Compare the calculated F<E T="52">o</E> factor with the expected F<E T="52">o</E> range for wood (1.000-1.120). Calculated F<E T="52">o</E> values beyond this acceptable range should be investigated before accepting the test results. For example, the strength of the solutions in the gas analyzer and the analyzing technique should be checked by sampling and analyzing a known concentration, such as air. If no detectable or correctable measurement error can be identified, the test should be repeated. Alternatively, determine a range of air-to-fuel ratio results that could include the correct value by using an F<E T="52">o</E> value of 1.05 and calculating a potential range of CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> values. Acceptance of such results will be based on whether the calculated range includes the <PRTPAGE P="586"/>exemption limit and the judgment of the Administrator.</P>

            <P>9.2 Method 3 Analyses. Compare the results of the analyses of the two bag samples. If all the gas components (O<E T="52">2</E>, CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>) values for the two analyses agree within 0.5 percent (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 6.0 percent O<E T="52">2</E> for bag 1 and 6.5 percent O<E T="52">2</E> for bag 2, agree within 0.5 percent), the results of the bag analyses may be averaged for the calculations in section 12. If the analysis results do not agree within 0.5 percent for each component, calculate the air-to-fuel ratio using both sets of analyses and report the results.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Summary of Test Method</HD>

            <P>4.1 Dilution Tunnel. Emissions are determined using the “dilution tunnel” method specified in ASTM E2515-11 <E T="03">Standard Test Method for Determination of Particulate Matter Emissions Collected in a Dilution Tunnel</E> (IBR, see § 60.17). The flow rate in the dilution tunnel is maintained at a constant level throughout the test cycle and accurately measured. Samples of the dilution tunnel flow stream are extracted at a constant flow rate and drawn through high efficiency filters. The filters are dried and weighed before and after the test to determine the emissions catch and this value is multiplied by the ratio of tunnel flow to filter flow to determine the total particulate emissions produced in the test cycle.</P>
            <P>4.2 Efficiency. The efficiency test procedure takes advantage of the fact that this type of appliance delivers heat through circulation of the heated liquid (water) from the appliance to a remote heat exchanger and back to the appliance. Measurements of the water temperature difference as it enters and exits the heat exchanger along with the measured flow rate allow for an accurate determination of the useful heat output of the appliance. The input is determined by weight of the test fuel charge, adjusted for moisture content, multiplied by the higher heating value. Additional measurements of the appliance weight and temperature at the beginning and end of a test cycle are used to correct for heat stored in the appliance. Overall efficiency (SLM) is determined using the CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) stack loss method for data quality assurance purposes.</P>

            <P>4.3 Operation. Appliance operation is conducted on a hot-to-hot test cycle meaning that the appliance is brought to operating <PRTPAGE P="589"/>temperature and a coal bed is established prior to the addition of the test fuel charge and measurements are made for each test fuel charge cycle. The measurements are made under constant heat draw conditions within predetermined ranges. No attempt is made to modulate the heat demand to simulate an indoor thermostat cycling on and off in response to changes in the indoor environment. Four test categories are used. These are:</P>
            <P>4.3.1 Category I: A heat output of 15 percent or less of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>
            <P>4.3.2 Category II: A heat output of 16 percent to 24 percent of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>
            <P>4.3.3 Category III: A heat output of 25 percent to 50 percent of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>

            <P>5.1.1 These measurements, when approved by state or federal agencies, are often required for the purpose of determining compliance with regulations and statutes.</P>
            <P>5.1.2 The measurements made before and after design modifications are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of design changes in reducing emissions and make this standard an important tool in manufacturers' research and development programs.</P>
            <P>5.2 Measurement of heating efficiency provides a uniform basis for comparison of product performance that is useful to the consumer. It is also required to relate emissions produced to the useful heat production.</P>
            <P>5.3 This is a laboratory method and is not intended to be fully representative of all actual field use. It is recognized that users of hand-fired, wood-burning equipment have a great deal of influence over the performance of any wood-burning appliance.

Record and report hourly flue gas exit temperature data and the hours of operation. The aging procedure shall be conducted and documented by a testing laboratory.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">12.0 Procedure</HD>
            <P>12.1 Appliance Installation. Assemble the appliance and parts in conformance with the manufacturer's written installation instructions. Clean the flue with an appropriately sized, wire chimney brush before each certification test series.</P>
            <P>12.2 Fuel. Test fuel charge fuel shall be red (<E T="03">Quercus ruba L.</E>) or white (<E T="03">Quercus alba</E>) oak 19 to 25 percent moisture content on a dry basis. Piece length shall be 80 percent of the firebox depth rounded down to the nearest 1 inch (25mm) increment. For example, if the firebox depth is 46 inches (1168mm) the 4 × 4 piece length would be 36 inches (46 inches × 0.8 = 36.8 inches rounded down to 36 inches). Pieces are to be placed in the firebox parallel to the longest firebox dimension. For fireboxes with sloped surfaces that create a non-uniform firebox length, the piece length shall be adjusted for each layer based on 80 percent of the length at the level where the layer is placed. Pieces are to be spaced <FR>3/4</FR> inches (19 mm) apart on all faces. The first fuel layer may be assembled using fuel units consisting of multiple 4 × 4s consisting of single pieces with bottom and side spacers of 3 or more pieces if needed for a stable layer. The second layer may consist of fuel units consisting of no more than two pieces with spacers attached on the bottom and side. The top two layers of the fuel charge must consist of single pieces unless the fuel charge is only three layers. In that instance only the top layer must consist of single units. Three-quarter inch (19 mm) by 1.5 inch (38 mm) spacers shall be attached to the bottom of piece to maintain a <FR>3/4</FR> inch (19 mm) separation. When a layer consists of two or more units of 4 × 4s an additional <FR>3/4</FR> inch (19 mm) thick by 1.5 inch (38 mm) wide spacer shall be attached to the vertical face of each end of one 4 × 4, such that the <FR>3/4</FR> inch (19 mm) space will be maintained when two 4 × 4 units or pieces are loaded side by side. In cases where a layer contains an odd number of 4 × 4s one piece shall not be attached, but shall have spacers attached in a manner that will provide for the <FR>3/4</FR> inch (19 mm) space to be maintained (See Figure 1). Spacers shall be attached perpendicular to the length of the 4 × 4s such that the edge of the spacer is 1 ± 0.25 inch from the end of the 4 × 4s in the previous layers. Spacers shall be red or white oak and will be attached with either nails (non-galvanized), brads or oak dowels. The use of kiln-dried wood is not allowed.</P>
            <P>12.2.1 Using a fuel moisture meter as specified in section 6.7 of the test method, determine the fuel moisture for each test fuel piece used for the test fuel load by averaging at least five fuel moisture meter readings measured parallel to the wood grain. Penetration of the moisture meter insulated electrodes for all readings shall be <FR>1/4</FR> the thickness of the fuel piece or 19 mm (<FR>3/4</FR> in.), whichever is lesser. One measurement from each of three sides shall be made at approximately 3 inches from each end and the center. Two additional measurements shall be made centered between the other three locations. Each individual moisture content reading shall be in the range of 18 to 28 percent on a dry basis. The average moisture content of each piece of test fuel shall be in the range of 19 to 25 percent. It is not required to measure the moisture content of the spacers. Moisture shall not be added to previously dried fuel pieces except by storage under high humidity conditions and temperature up to 100 °F. Fuel moisture shall be measured within 4 hours of using the fuel for a test.</P>
            <P>12.2.2 Firebox Volume. Determine the firebox volume in cubic feet. Firebox volume shall include all areas accessible through the fuel loading door where firewood could reasonably be placed up to the horizontal plane defined by the top of the loading door. A drawing of the firebox showing front, side and plan views or an isometric view with interior dimensions shall be provided by the manufacturer and verified by the laboratory. Calculations for firebox volume from computer aided design (CAD) software programs are acceptable and shall be included in the test report if used. If the firebox volume is calculated by the laboratory the firebox drawings and calculations shall be included in the test report.</P>

            <P>12.2.3 Test Fuel Charge. Test fuel charges shall be determined by multiplying the firebox volume by 10 pounds (4.54 kg) per ft<SU>3</SU> (28L), or a higher load density as recommended by the manufacturer's printed operating instructions, of wood (as used wet weight). Select the number of pieces of standard fuel that most nearly match this target weight. This is the standard fuel charge for all tests. For example, if the firebox loading area volume is 10 ft<SU>3</SU> (280L) and the firebox depth is 46 inches (1168 mm), test fuel charge target is 100 lbs (45 kg) minimum and the piece length is 36 inches (914 mm). If eight 4 × 4s, 36 inches long weigh 105 lbs (48 kg), use 8 pieces for each test fuel charge. All test fuel charges will be of the same configuration.<PRTPAGE P="592"/>
            </P>

            <P>12.3 Sampling Equipment. Prepare the particulate emission sampling equipment as defined by ASTM E2515-11 <E T="03">Standard Test Method for Determination of Particulate Matter Emissions Collected in a Dilution Tunnel</E> (IBR, see § 60.17). Upon request, four-inch filters may be used. Upon request, Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used.</P>
            <P>12.4 Appliance Startup. The appliance shall be fired with wood fuel of any species, size and moisture content at the laboratories' discretion to bring it up to operating temperature. Operate the appliance until the water is heated to the upper operating control limit and has cycled at least two times. Then remove all unburned fuel, zero the scale and verify the scales accuracy using dead weights.</P>
            <P>12.4.1 Pretest Burn Cycle. Reload appliance with oak wood and allow it to burn down to the specified coal bed weight. The pretest burn cycle fuel charge weight shall be within ±10 percent of the test fuel charge weight. Piece size and length shall be selected such that charcoalization is achieved by the time the fuel charge has burned down to the required coal bed weight. Pieces with a maximum thickness of approximately 2 inches have been found to be suitable. Charcoalization is a general condition of the test fuel bed evidenced by an absence of large pieces of burning wood in the coal bed and the remaining fuel pieces being brittle enough to be broken into smaller charcoal pieces with a metal poker. Manipulations to the fuel bed prior to the start of the test run are to be done to achieve charcoalization while maintaining the desired heat output rate. During the pre-test burn cycle and at least one hour prior to starting the test run, adjust water flow to the heat exchanger to establish the target heat draw for the test. For the first test run the heat draw rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>
            <P>12.4.1.1 Allowable Adjustments. Fuel addition or subtractions, and coal bed raking shall be kept to a minimum but are allowed up to 15 minutes prior to the start of the test run. For the purposes of this method, coal bed raking is the use of a metal tool (poker) to stir coals, break burning fuel into smaller pieces, dislodge fuel pieces from positions of poor combustion, and check for the condition of charcoalization. Record all adjustments to and additions or subtractions of fuel, and any other changes to the appliance operations that occur during pretest ignition period. During the 15-minute period prior to the start of the test run, the wood heater loading door shall not be open more than a total of 1 minute. Coal bed raking is the only adjustment allowed during this period.</P>
            <P>12.4.2 Coal Bed Weight. The appliance is to be loaded with the test fuel charge when the coal bed weight is between 10 percent and 20 percent of the test fuel charge weight. Coals may be raked as necessary to level the coal bed but may only be raked and stirred once between 15 to 20 minutes prior to the addition of the test fuel charge.</P>
            <P>12.5 Test Runs. For all test runs, the return water temperature to the hydronic heater must be equal to or greater than 120 °F. Aquastat or other heater output control device settings that are adjustable shall be set using manufacturer specifications, either as factory set or in accordance with the owner's manual, and shall remain the same for all burn categories.</P>
            <P>Complete a test run in each heat output rate category, as follows:</P>
            <P>12.5.1 Test Run Start. Once the appliance is operating normally and the pretest coal bed weight has reached the target value per section 12.4.2, tare the scale and load the full test charge into the appliance. Time for loading shall not exceed 5 minutes. The actual weight of the test fuel charge shall be measured and recorded within 30 minutes prior to loading. Start all sampling systems.</P>
            <P>12.5.1.1 Record all water temperatures, differential water temperatures and water flow rates at time intervals of one minute or less.</P>
            <P>12.5.1.2 Record particulate emissions data per the requirements of ASTM E2515 (IBR, see § 60.17).</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3 Record data needed to determine overall efficiency (SLM) per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.3, 8.5.7, 10.4.3 (a), 10.4.3(f), and 13.7.9.3</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3.1 Measure and record the test room air temperature in accordance with the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.1, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3 (g).</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3.2 Measure and record the flue gas temperature in accordance with the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.2, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3 (f).</P>

            <P>12.5.1.3.3 Determine and record the carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) concentrations in the flue gas in accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.3, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3 (i) and (j).</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3.4 Measure and record the test fuel weight per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 8.5.7 and 10.4.3 (h).</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3.5 Record the test run time per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 10.4.3 (a).</P>

            <P>12.5.1.4 Monitor the average heat output rate on the load side of the heat exchanger. If the heat output rate gets close to the upper or lower limit of the target range (±5 percent) adjust the water flow through the heat exchanger to compensate. Make changes as infrequently as possible while maintaining the target heat output rate. The first test run shall be conducted at the Category IV heat output rate to validate that <PRTPAGE P="593"/>the appliance is capable of producing the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>

            <P>12.5.2 Test Fuel Charge Adjustment. It is acceptable to adjust the test fuel charge (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> reposition) once during a test run if more than 60 percent of the initial test fuel charge weight has been consumed and more than 10 minutes have elapsed without a measurable (1 lb or 0. 5 kg) weight change while the operating control is in the demand mode. The time used to make this adjustment shall be less than 60 seconds.</P>
            <P>12.5.3 Test Run Completion. The test run is completed when the remaining weight of the test fuel charge is 0.0 lb (0.0 kg). End the test run when the scale has indicated a test fuel charge weight of 0.0 lb (0.0 kg) or less for 30 seconds.</P>
            <P>12.5.3.1 At the end of the test run, stop the particulate sampling train and overall efficiency (SLM) measurements, and record the run time, and all final measurement values.</P>
            <P>12.5.4 Heat Output Capacity Validation. The first test run must produce a heat output rate that is within 10 percent of the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity (Category IV) throughout the test run and an average heat output rate within 5 percent of the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity. If the appliance is not capable of producing a heat output within these limits, the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity is considered not validated and testing is to be terminated. In such cases, the tests may be restarted using a lower heat output capacity if requested by the manufacturer.</P>
            <P>12.5.5 Additional Test Runs. Using the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity as a basis, conduct a test for additional heat output categories as specified in section 4.3. It is not required to run these tests in any particular order.</P>
            <P>12.5.6 Alternative Heat Output Rate for Category I. If an appliance cannot be operated in the Category I heat output range due to stopped combustion, two test runs shall be conducted at heat output rates within Category II, provided that the completed test run burn rate is no greater than the burn rate expected in home use. If this rate cannot be achieved, the test is not valid.</P>
            <P>When the alternative heat output rate is used, the weightings for the weighted averages indicated in Table 2 shall be the average of the Category I and II weightings and shall be applied to both Category II results. The two completed runs in Category II will be deemed to meet the requirement for runs completed in both Category I and Category II. Appliances that are not capable of operation within Category II (&lt;25 percent of maximum) cannot be evaluated by this test method. The test report must include full documentation and discussion of the attempted runs, completed rums and calculations.</P>
            <P>12.5.6.1 Stopped Fuel Combustion. Evidence that an appliance cannot be operated at a Category I heat output rate due to stopped fuel combustion shall include documentation of two or more attempts to operate the appliance in burn rate Category I and fuel combustion has stopped prior to complete consumption of the test fuel charge. Stopped fuel combustion is evidenced when an elapsed time of 60 minutes or more has occurred without a measurable (1 lb or 0.5 kg) weight change in the test fuel charge while the appliance operating control is in the demand mode. Report the evidence and the reasoning used to determine that a test in burn rate Category I cannot be achieved. For example, two unsuccessful attempts to operate at an output rate of 10 percent of the rated output capacity are not sufficient evidence that burn rate Category I cannot be achieved. Note that section 12.5.6 requires that the completed test run burn rate can be no greater than the burn rate expected in home use. If this rate cannot be achieved, the test is not valid.</P>
            <P>12.5.7 Appliance Overheating. Appliances shall be capable of operating in all heat output categories without overheating to be rated by this test method. Appliance overheating occurs when the rate of heat withdrawal from the appliance is lower than the rate of heat production when the unit control is in the idle mode. This condition results in the water in the appliance continuing to increase in temperature well above the upper limit setting of the operating control. Evidence of overheating includes: 1 hour or more of appliance water temperature increase above the upper temperature set-point of the operating control, exceeding the temperature limit of a safety control device (independent from the operating control), boiling water in a non-pressurized system or activation of a pressure or temperature relief valve in a pressurized system.</P>
            <P>12.6 Additional Test Runs. The testing laboratory may conduct more than one test run in each of the heat output categories specified in section 4.3.1. If more than one test run is conducted at a specified heat output rate, the results from at least two-thirds of the test runs in that heat output rate category shall be used in calculating the weighted average emission rate (See section 14.1.14). The measurement data and results of all test runs shall be reported regardless of which values are used in calculating the weighted average emission rate.</P>

            <P>For determination of the average overall thermal efficiency (η<E T="52">SLM</E>) for the test run, use the data collected over the full test run and the calculations in accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clause 13.7 except for 13.7.2 (e), (f), (g), and (h), use the following average fuel properties for oak: percent C = 50.0, percent H = 6.6, percent O = 43.2, percent ash = 0.2 percent. The averaging period for determination of efficiency by the stack loss method allows averaging over 10 minute time periods for flue gas temperature, flue gas CO<E T="52">2</E>, and flue gas CO for the determination of the efficiency. However, under some cycling conditions the “on” period may be short relative to this 10 minute period. For this reason, during cycling operation the averaging period for these parameters may not be longer than the burner on period divided by 10. The averaging period need not be shorter than one minute. During the off period, under cycling operation, the averaging periods specified may be used. Where short averaging times are used, however, the averaging period for fuel consumption may still be at 10 minutes.

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <P>1.1 This test method applies to wood-fired hydronic heating appliances with heat storage external to the appliance. The units typically transfer heat through circulation of a liquid heat exchange media such as water or a water-antifreeze mixture. Throughout this document, the term “water” will be used to denote any of the heat transfer liquids approved for use by the manufacturer.</P>
            <P>1.2 The test method measures PM and CO emissions and delivered heating efficiency at specified heat output rates referenced against the appliance's rated heating capacity as specified by the manufacturer and verified under this test method.</P>
            <P>1.3 PM emissions are measured by the dilution tunnel method as specified in the EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein with the exceptions noted in section 12.5.9. Delivered efficiency is measured by determining the fuel energy input and appliance output. Heat output is determined through measurement of the flow rate and temperature change of water circulated through a heat exchanger external to the appliance and the increase in energy of the external storage. Heat input is determined from the mass of dry wood fuel and its higher heating value (HHV). Delivered efficiency does not attempt to account for pipeline loss.</P>
            <P>1.4 Products covered by this test method include both pressurized and non-pressurized hydronic heating appliances intended to be fired with wood and for which the manufacturer specifies for indoor or outdoor installation. The system, which includes the heating appliance and external storage, is commonly connected to a heat exchanger by insulated pipes and normally includes a pump to circulate heated liquid. These systems are used to heat structures such as homes, barns and greenhouses. They also provide heat for domestic hot water, spas and swimming pools.</P>
            <P>1.5 Distinguishing features of products covered by this standard include:</P>
            <P>1.5.1 The manufacturer specifies the application for either indoor or outdoor installation.</P>
            <P>1.5.2 A firebox with an access door for hand loading of fuel.</P>
            <P>1.5.3 Typically an aquastat mounted as part of the appliance that controls combustion air supply to maintain the liquid in the appliance within a predetermined temperature range provided sufficient fuel is available in the firebox. The appliance may be equipped with other devices to control combustion.</P>
            <P>1.5.4 A chimney or vent that exhausts combustion products from the appliance.</P>
            <P>1.5.5 A liquid storage system, typically water, which is not large enough to accept all of the heat produced when a full load of wood is burned and the storage system starts a burn cycle at 125 °F.</P>
            <P>1.5.6 The heating appliances require external thermal storage and these units will only be installed as part of a system which includes thermal storage. The manufacturer specifies the minimum amount of thermal storage required. However, the storage system shall be large enough to ensure that the boiler (heater) does not cycle, slumber, or go into an off-mode when operated in a Category III load condition (See section 4.3).</P>
            <P>1.6 The values stated are to be regarded as the standard whether in I-P or SI units. The values given in parentheses are for information only.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Summary of Test Method</HD>
            <P>4.1 Dilution Tunnel. Emissions are determined using the “dilution tunnel” method specified in EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein. The flow rate in the dilution tunnel is maintained at a constant level throughout the test cycle and accurately measured. Samples of the dilution tunnel flow stream are extracted at a constant flow rate and drawn through high efficiency filters. The filters are dried and weighed before and after the test to determine the emissions collected and this value is multiplied by the ratio of tunnel flow to filter flow to determine the total particulate emissions produced in the test cycle.</P>

            <P>4.2 Efficiency. The efficiency test procedure takes advantage of the fact that this type of system delivers heat through circulation of the heated liquid (water) from the system to a remote heat exchanger (<E T="03">e.g.</E> baseboard radiators in a room) and back to the system. Measurements of the cooling water temperature difference as it enters and exits the test system heat exchanger along with the measured flow rate allow for an accurate determination of the useful heat output of the appliance. Also included in the heat output is the change in the energy content in the storage system during a test run. Energy input to the appliance during the test run is determined by weight of the test fuel charge, adjusted for moisture content, multiplied by the higher heating value. Additional measurements of the appliance weight and temperature at the beginning and end of a test cycle are used to correct for heat stored in the appliance. Overall efficiency (SLM) is determined using the CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) stack loss method for data quality assurance purposes.</P>
            <P>4.3 Operation. Four test categories are defined for use in this method. These are:</P>
            <P>4.3.1 Category I: A heat output of 15 percent or less of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>
            <P>4.3.2 Category II: A heat output of 16 percent to 24 percent of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>
            <P>4.3.3 Category III: A heat output of 25 percent to 50 percent of manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>
            <P>4.3.4 Category IV: Manufacturer's Rated Heat Output Capacity. These heat output categories refer to the output from the system by way of the load heat exchanger installed for the test. The output from just the boiler/heater part of the system may be higher for all or part of a test, as part of this boiler/heater output goes to storage.</P>

            <P>For the Category III and IV runs, appliance operation is conducted on a hot-to-hot test <PRTPAGE P="603"/>cycle meaning that the appliance is brought to operating temperature and a coal bed is established prior to the addition of the test fuel charge and measurements are made for each test fuel charge cycle. The measurements are made under constant heat draw conditions within pre-determined ranges. No attempt is made to modulate the heat demand to simulate an indoor thermostat cycling on and off in response to changes in the indoor environment.</P>
            <P>For the Category I and II runs, the unit is tested with a “cold start.” At the manufacturer's option, the Category II and III runs may be waived and it may be assumed that the particulate emission values and efficiency values determined in the startup, steady-state, and end phases of Category I are applicable in Categories II and III for the purpose of determining the annual averages in lb/mmBtu and g/MJ (See section 13). For the annual average in g/hr, the length of time for stored heat to be drawn from thermal storage shall be determined for the test load requirements of the respective category.</P>
            <P>All test operations and measurements shall be conducted by personnel of the laboratory responsible for the submission of the test report.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 Significance and Use</HD>
            <P>5.1 The measurement of particulate matter emission and CO rates is an important test method widely used in the practice of air pollution control.</P>
            <P>5.1.1 These measurements, when approved by state or federal agencies, are often required for the purpose of determining compliance with regulations and statutes.</P>
            <P>5.1.2 The measurements made before and after design modifications are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of design changes in reducing emissions and make this standard an important tool in manufacturers' research and development programs.</P>
            <P>5.2 Measurement of heating efficiency provides a uniform basis for comparison of product performance that is useful to the consumer. It is also required to relate emissions produced to the useful heat production.</P>
            <P>5.3 This is a laboratory method and is not intended to be fully representative of all actual field use. It is recognized that users of hand-fired, wood-burning equipment have a great deal of influence over the performance of any wood-burning appliance.

            <P>8.2 The size, connection arrangement, and control arrangement for the thermal storage shall be as specified in the manufacturer's documentation. It is not necessary to use the specific storage system that the boiler/heater will be marketed with. However, the capacity of the system used in the test cannot be greater than that specified as the minimum allowable for the boiler/heater.</P>
            <P>8.3 All system control settings shall be the as-shipped, default settings. These default settings shall be the same as those communicated in a document to the installer or end user. These control settings and the documentation of the control settings as to be provided to the installer or end user shall be part of the test record.</P>
            <P>8.4 Where the manufacturer defines several alternatives for the connection and loading arrangement, one shall be defined in the appliance documentation as the default or standard installation. It is expected that this will be the configuration for use with a simple baseboard heating system. This is the configuration to be followed for these tests. The manufacturer's documentation shall define the other arrangements as optional or alternative arrangements.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.0 Preparation of Test Equipment</HD>
            <P>9.1 The appliance is to be placed on a scale capable of weighing the appliance fully loaded with a resolution of ±0.2 lb (0.1 kg).</P>
            <P>9.2 The appliance shall be fitted with the type of chimney recommended or provided by the manufacturer and extending to 15 ±0.5 feet (4.6 ±0.15 m) from the upper surface of the scale. If no flue or chimney system is recommended or provided by the manufacturer, connect the appliance to a flue of a diameter equal to the flue outlet of the appliance. The flue section from the appliance flue collar to 8 ±0.5 feet above the scale shall be single wall stove pipe and the remainder of the flue shall be double wall insulated class A chimney.</P>
            <P>9.3 Optional Equipment Use</P>
            <P>9.3.1 A recirculation pump may be installed between connections at the top and bottom of the appliance to minimize thermal stratification if specified by the manufacturer. The pump shall not be installed in such a way as to change or affect the flow rate between the appliance and the heat exchanger.</P>
            <P>9.3.2 If the manufacturer specifies that a thermal control valve or other device be installed and set to control the return water temperature to a specific set point, the valve or other device shall be installed and set per the manufacturer's written instructions.</P>
            <P>9.4 Prior to filling the boiler/heater with water, weigh and record the appliance mass.</P>
            <P>9.5 Heat Exchanger</P>
            <P>9.5.1 Plumb the unit to a water-to-water heat exchanger with sufficient capacity to draw off heat at the maximum rate anticipated. Route hoses and electrical cables and instrument wires in a manner that does not influence the weighing accuracy of the scale as indicated by placing dead weights on the platform and verifying the scale's accuracy.</P>
            <P>9.5.2 Locate thermocouples to measure the water temperature at the inlet and outlet of the load side of the heat exchanger.</P>
            <P>9.5.3 Install a thermopile (or equivalent instrumentation) meeting the requirements of section 6.3 to measure the water temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the load side of the heat exchanger</P>
            <P>9.5.4 Install a calibrated water flow meter in the heat exchanger load side supply line. The water flow meter is to be installed on the cooling water inlet side of the heat exchanger so that it will operate at the temperature at which it is calibrated.</P>
            <P>9.5.5 Place the heat exchanger in a box with 2 in. (50 mm) of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam insulation surrounding it to minimize heat losses from the heat exchanger.</P>
            <P>9.5.6 The reported efficiency and heat output rate shall be based on measurements made on the load side of the heat exchanger.</P>

            <P>9.5.7 Temperature instrumentation per section 6.6 shall be installed in the appliance outlet and return lines. The average of the outlet and return water temperature on the supply side of the system shall be considered the average appliance temperature for calculation of heat storage in the appliance (<E T="03">TF</E>
              <E T="54">avg</E> and <E T="03">TI</E>
              <E T="54">avg</E>). Installation of a water flow meter in the supply side of the system is optional.<PRTPAGE P="605"/>
            </P>
            <P>9.6 Storage Tank. The storage tank shall include a destratification pump as illustrated in Figure 1. The pump will draw from the bottom of the tank and return to the top as illustrated. Temperature sensors (TS1 and TS2 in Figure 1) shall be included to measure the temperature in the recirculation loop. The valve plan in Figure 1 allows the tank recirculation loop to operate and the boiler/heater-to-heat exchanger loop to operate at the same time but in isolation. This would typically be done before the start of a test or following completion of a test to determine the end of test average tank temperature. The nominal flow rate in the storage tank recirculation loop can be estimated based on pump manufacturers' performance curves and any significant restriction in the recirculation loop.</P>
            <P>9.7 Fill the system with water. Determine the total weight of the water in the appliance when the water is circulating. Verify that the scale indicates a stable weight under operating conditions. Make sure air is purged properly.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 Calibration and Standardization</HD>
            <P>10.1 Water Temperature Sensors. Temperature measuring equipment shall be calibrated before initial use and at least semi-annually thereafter. Calibrations shall be in compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Monograph 175, Standard Limits of Error.</P>
            <P>10.2 Heat Exchanger Load Side Water Flow Meter.</P>
            <P>10.2.1 The heat exchanger load side water flow meter shall be calibrated within the flow range used for the test run using NIST-traceable methods. Verify the calibration of the water flow meter before and after each test run and at least once during each test run by comparing the water flow rate indicated by the flow meter to the mass of water collected from the outlet of the heat exchanger over a timed interval. Volume of the collected water shall be determined based on the water density calculated from section 13, Eq. 12, using the water temperature measured at the flow meter. The uncertainty in the verification procedure used shall be 1 percent or less. The water flow rate determined by the collection and weighing method shall be within 1 percent of the flow rate indicated by the water flow meter.</P>
            <P>10.3 Scales. The scales used to weigh the appliance and test fuel charge shall be calibrated using NIST-traceable methods at least once every 6 months.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Conditioning</HD>
            <P>11.1 Prior to testing, an appliance is to be operated for a minimum of 50 hours using a medium heat draw rate. The conditioning may be at the manufacturer's facility prior to the certification test. If the conditioning is at the certification test laboratory, the pre-burn for the first test can be included as part of the conditioning requirement. If conditioning is included in pre-burn, then the appliance shall be aged with fuel meeting the specifications outlined in section 12.2 with a moisture content between 19 and 25 percent on a dry basis. Operate the appliance at a medium heat output rate (Category II or III) for at least 10 hours for non-catalytic appliances and 50 hours for catalytic appliances. Record and report hourly flue gas exit temperature data and the hours of operation. The aging procedure shall be conducted and documented by a testing laboratory.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">12.0 Procedure</HD>
            <P>12.1 Appliance Installation. Assemble the appliance and parts in conformance with the manufacturer's written installation instructions. Clean the flue with an appropriately sized, wire chimney brush before each certification test series.</P>
            <P>12.2 Fuel. Test fuel charge fuel shall be red (<E T="03">Quercus ruba L.</E>) or white (<E T="03">Quercus Alba</E>) oak 19 to 25 percent moisture content on a dry basis. Piece length shall be 80 percent of the firebox depth rounded down to the nearest 1 inch (25mm) increment. For example, if the firebox depth is 46 inches (1168mm) the piece length would be 36 inches (46 inches × 0.8 = 36.8 inches, rounded down to 36 inches). Pieces are to be placed in the firebox parallel to the longest firebox dimension. For fireboxes with sloped surfaces that create a non-uniform firebox length, the piece length shall be adjusted for each layer based on 80 percent of the length at the level where the layer is placed. The test fuel shall be cord wood with cross section dimensions and weight limits as defined in CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), section 8.3, Table 4. The use of dimensional lumber is not allowed.</P>
            <P>12.2.1 Select three pieces of cord wood from the same batch of wood as the test fuel and the same weight as the average weight of the pieces in the test load ±1.0 lb. From each of these three pieces, cut three slices. Each slice shall be <FR>1/2</FR> inch to <FR>3/4</FR> inch thick. One slice shall be cut across the center of the length of the piece. The other two slices shall be cut half way between the center and the end. Immediately measure the mass of each piece in pounds. Dry each slice in an oven at 220 °F for 24 hours or until no further weight change occurs. The slices shall be arranged in the oven so as to provide separation between faces. Remove from the oven and measure the mass of each piece again as soon as practical, in pounds.</P>
            <P>The moisture content of each slice, on a dry basis, shall be calculated as:</P>

              <E T="03">MC</E>
              <E T="54">Slice</E> = moisture content of the slice in % dry basis</FP>
            
            <P>The average moisture content of the entire test load (MC) shall be determined using Eq. 6. Each individual slice shall have a moisture content in the range of 18 percent to 28 percent on a dry basis. The average moisture content for the test fuel load shall be in the range of 19 percent to 25 percent. Moisture shall not be added to previously dried fuel pieces except by storage under high humidity conditions and temperature up to 100 °F. Fuel moisture measurement shall begin within 4 hours of using the fuel batch for a test. Use of a pin-type meter to estimate the moisture content prior to a test is recommended.</P>
            <P>12.2.2 Firebox Volume. Determine the firebox volume in cubic feet. Firebox volume shall include all areas accessible through the fuel loading door where firewood could reasonably be placed up to the horizontal plane defined by the top of the loading door. A drawing of the firebox showing front, side and plan views or an isometric view with interior dimensions shall be provided by the manufacturer and verified by the laboratory. Calculations for firebox volume from computer aided design (CAD) software programs are acceptable and shall be included in the test report if used. If the firebox volume is calculated by the laboratory the firebox drawings and calculations shall be included in the test report.</P>
            <P>12.2.3 Test Fuel charge. Test fuel charges shall be determined by multiplying the firebox volume by 10 pounds (4.54 kg) per ft<SU>3</SU> (28L), or a higher load density as recommended by the manufacturer's printed operating instructions, of wood (as used wet weight). Select the number of pieces of cord wood that most nearly match this target weight. However, the test fuel charge cannot be less than the target of 10 pounds (4.54 kg) per ft<SU>3</SU> (28L).</P>
            <P>12.3 Sampling Equipment. Prepare the particulate emission sampling equipment as defined by EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein.</P>
            <P>12.4 Appliance Startup. The appliance shall be fired with wood fuel of any species, size and moisture content, at the laboratory's discretion, to bring it up to operating temperature. Operate the appliance until the water is heated to the upper operating control limit and has cycled at least two times. Then remove all unburned fuel, zero the scale and verify the scales accuracy using dead weights.</P>
            <P>12.4.1 Startup Procedure for Category III and IV Test Runs, “Hot-to-Hot.”</P>
            <P>12.4.1.1 Pretest t Burn Cycle. Following appliance startup (section 12.4), reload appliance with oak cord wood and allow it to burn down to the specified coal bed weight. The pre-test burn cycle fuel charge weight shall be within ±10 percent of the test fuel charge weight. Piece size and length shall be selected such that charcoalization is achieved by the time the fuel charge has burned down to the required coal bed weight. Pieces with a maximum thickness of approximately 2 inches have been found to be suitable. Charcoalization is a general condition of the test fuel bed evidenced by an absence of large pieces of burning wood in the coal bed and the remaining fuel pieces being brittle enough to be broken into smaller charcoal pieces with a metal poker. Manipulations to the fuel bed prior to the start of the test run are to be done to achieve charcoalization while maintaining the desired heat output rate. During the pre-test burn cycle and at least one hour prior to starting the test run, adjust water flow to the heat exchanger to establish the target heat draw for the test. For the first test run the heat draw rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>
            <P>12.4.1.2 Allowable Adjustments. Fuel addition or subtractions, and coal bed raking shall be kept to a minimum but are allowed up to 15 minutes prior to the start of the test run. For the purposes of this method, coal bed raking is the use of a metal tool (poker) to stir coals, break burning fuel into smaller pieces, dislodge fuel pieces from positions of poor combustion, and check for the condition of charcoalization. Record all adjustments to and additions or subtractions of fuel, and any other changes to the appliance operations that occur during pretest ignition period. During the 15-minute period prior to the start of the test run, the wood heater loading door shall not be open more than a total of 1 minute. Coal bed raking is the only adjustment allowed during this period.</P>

            <P>12.4.1.3 Coal Bed Weight. The appliance is to be loaded with the test fuel charge when the coal bed weight is between 10 percent and 20 percent of the test fuel charge weight. Coals may be raked as necessary to level the coal bed but may only be raked and stirred <PRTPAGE P="607"/>once between 15 to 20 minutes prior to the addition of the test fuel charge.</P>

            <P>12.4.1.4 Storage. The Category III and IV test runs may be done either with or without the thermal storage. If thermal storage is used, the initial temperature of the storage must be 125 °F or greater at the start of the test. The storage may be heated during the pre-test burn cycle or it may be heated by external means. If thermal storage is used, prior to the start of the test run, the storage tank destratification pump, shown in Figure 1, shall be operated until the total volume pumped exceeds 1.5 times the tank volume and the difference between the temperature at the top and bottom of the storage tank (TS<E T="52">1</E> and TS<E T="52">2</E>) is less than 1 °F. These two temperatures shall then be recorded to determine the starting average tank temperature. The total volume pumped may be based on the nominal flow rate of the destratification pump (See section 9.6). If the Category III and IV runs are done with storage, it is recognized that during the last hour of the pre-burn cycle the storage tank must be mixed to achieve a uniform starting temperature and cannot receive heat from the boiler/heater during this time. During this time period, the boiler/heater might cycle or go into a steady reduced output mode. (Note—this would happen, for example, in a Category IV run if the actual maximum output of the boiler/heater exceed the manufacturer's rated output.) A second storage tank may be used temporarily to enable the boiler/heater to operate during this last hour of the pre-burn period as it will during the test period. The temperature of this second storage tank is not used in the calculations but the return water to the boiler/heater (after mixing device if used) must be 125 °F or greater.</P>
            <P>12.4.2 Startup Procedure for Category I and II Test Runs, “Cold-to-Cold.”</P>
            <P>12.4.2.1 Initial Temperatures. This test shall be started with both the boiler/heater and the storage at a minimum temperature of 125 °F. The boiler/heater maximum temperature at the start of this test shall be 135 °F. The boiler/heater and storage may be heated through a pre-burn or it may be heated by external means.</P>

            <P>12.4.2.2 Firebox Condition at Test Start. Prior to the start of this test remove all ash and charcoal from the combustion chamber(s). The loading of the test fuel and kindling should follow the manufacturer's recommendations, subject to the following constraints: Up to 10 percent kindling and paper may be used which is in addition to the fuel load. Further, up to 10 percent of the fuel load (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> included in the 10 lb/ft<SU>3</SU>) may be smaller than the main fuel. This startup fuel shall still be larger than 2 inches.</P>

            <P>12.4.2.3 Storage. The Category I and II test runs shall be done with thermal storage. The initial temperature of the storage must be 125 °F or greater at the start of the test. The storage may be heated during the pre-test burn cycle or it may be heated by external means. Prior to the start of the test run, the storage tank destratification pump, shown in Figure 1, shall be operated until the total volume pumped exceeds 1.5 times the tank volume and the difference between the temperature at the top and bottom of the storage tank (TS<E T="52">1</E> and TS<E T="52">2</E>) is less than 1 °F. These two temperatures shall then be recorded to determine the starting average tank temperature. The total volume pumped may be based on the nominal flow rate of the destratification pump (See section 9.6).</P>
            <P>12.5 Test Runs. For all test runs, the return water temperature to the hydronic heater must be equal to or greater than 120 °F (this is lower than the initial tank temperature to allow for any pipeline losses). Where the storage system is used, flow of water from the boiler/heater shall be divided between the storage tank and the heat exchanger such that the temperature change of the circulating water across the heat exchanger shall be 30 ±5 °F, averaged over the entire test run. This is typically adjusted using the system valves.</P>
            <P>Complete a test run in each heat output rate category, as follows:</P>
            <P>12.5.1 Test Run Start. For Category III and IV runs: Once the appliance is operating normally and the pretest coal bed weight has reached the target value per section 12.4.1, tare the scale and load the full test charge into the appliance. Time for loading shall not exceed 5 minutes. The actual weight of the test fuel charge shall be measured and recorded within 30 minutes prior to loading. Start all sampling systems.</P>
            <P>For Category I and II runs: Once the appliance has reached the starting temperature, tare the scale and load the full test charge, including kindling into the appliance. The actual weight of the test fuel charge shall be measured and recorded within 30 minutes prior to loading. Light the fire following the manufacturer's written normal startup procedure. Start all sampling systems.</P>
            <P>12.5.1.1 Record all water temperatures, differential water temperatures and water flow rates at time intervals of one minute or less.</P>
            <P>12.5.1.2 Record particulate emissions data per the requirements of EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein.</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3 Record data needed to determine overall efficiency (SLM) per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) clauses 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.3, 8.5.7, 10.4.3(a), 10.4.3(f), and 13.7.9.3</P>

            <P>12.5.1.3.1 Measure and record the test room air temperature in accordance with the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.1, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3(g).<PRTPAGE P="608"/>
            </P>
            <P>12.5.1.3.2 Measure and record the flue gas temperature in accordance with the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.2.2, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3(f).</P>

            <P>12.5.1.3.3 Determine and record the carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) concentrations in the flue gas in accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 6.3, 8.5.7 and 10.4.3(i) and (j).</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3.4 Measure and record the test fuel weight per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clauses 8.5.7 and 10.4.3(h).</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3.5 Record the test run time per the requirements of CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clause 10.4.3(a).</P>
            <P>12.5.1.3.6 Record and document all settings and adjustments, if any, made to the boiler/heater as recommended/required by manufacturer's instruction manual for different combustion conditions or heat loads. These may include temperature setpoints, under and over-fire air adjustment, or other adjustments that could be made by an operator to optimize or alter combustion. All such settings shall be included in the report for each test run.</P>
            <P>12.5.1.4 Monitor the average heat output rate on the load side of the heat exchanger based on water temperatures and flow. If the heat output rate over a 10 minute averaging period gets close to the upper or lower limit of the target range (±5 percent), adjust the water flow through the heat exchanger to compensate. Make changes as infrequently as possible while maintaining the target heat output rate. The first test run shall be conducted at the Category IV heat output rate to validate that the appliance is capable of producing the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity.</P>

            <P>12.5.2 Test Fuel Charge Adjustment. It is acceptable to adjust the test fuel charge (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> reposition) once during a test run if more than 60 percent of the initial test fuel charge weight has been consumed and more than 10 minutes have elapsed without a measurable (1 lb or 0.5 kg) weight change while the operating control is in the demand mode. The time used to make this adjustment shall be less than 60 seconds.</P>

            <P>12.5.3 Test Run Completion. For the Category III and IV, “hot-to-hot” test runs, the test run is completed when the remaining weight of the test fuel charge is 0.0 lb (0.0 kg). (<E T="03">W</E>
              <E T="54">FuelBurned</E> = <E T="03">W</E>
              <E T="54">fuel</E>) End the test run when the scale has indicated a test fuel charge weight of 0.0 lb (0.0 kg) or less for 30 seconds.</P>
            <P>For the Category I and II “cold-to-cold” test runs, the test run is completed; and the end of a test is defined at the first occurrence of any one of the following:</P>

            <P>(a) The remaining weight of the test fuel charge is less than 1 percent of the total test fuel weight (<E T="03">W</E>
              <E T="54">FuelBurned</E> &gt; 0.99 · <E T="03">W</E>
              <E T="54">fuel</E>);</P>
            <P>(b) The automatic control system on the boiler/heater switches to an off mode. In this case, the boiler/heater fan (if used) is typically stopped and all air flow dampers are closed by the control system. Note that this off mode cannot be an “overheat” or emergency shutdown which typically requires a manual reset; or</P>
            <P>(c) If the boiler/heater does not have an automatic off mode: After 90 percent of the fuel load has been consumed and the scale has indicated a rate of change of the test fuel charge of less than 1.0 lb/hr for a period of 10 minutes or longer. Note—this is not considered “stopped fuel combustion,” See section 12.5.6.1.</P>
            <P>12.5.3.1 At the end of the test run, stop the particulate sampling train and overall efficiency (SLM) measurements, and record the run time, and all final measurement values.</P>
            <P>12.5.3.2 At the end of the test run, continue to operate the storage tank destratification pump until the total volume pumped exceeds 1.5 times the tank volume. The maximum average of the top and bottom temperatures measured after this time may be taken as the average tank temperature at the end of the tests (TFSavg, See section 13.1). The total volume pumped may be based on the nominal flow rate of the destratification pump (See section 9.6).</P>
            <P>12.5.3.3 For the Category I and II test runs, there is a need to determine the energy content of the unburned fuel remaining in the chamber if the remaining mass in the chamber is greater than 1 percent of the test fuel weight. Following the completion of the test, as soon as safely practical, this remaining fuel is removed from the chamber, separated from the remaining ash and weighed. This separation could be implemented with a slotted “scoop” or similar tool. A <FR>1/4</FR> inch opening size in the separation tool shall be used to separate the ash and charcoal. This separated char is assigned a heating value of 12,500 Btu/lb.</P>
            <P>12.5.4 Heat Output Capacity Validation. The first test run must produce a heat output rate that is within 10 percent of the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity (Category IV) throughout the test run and an average heat output rate within 5 percent of the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity. If the appliance is not capable of producing a heat output within these limits, the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity is considered not validated and testing is to be terminated. In such cases, the tests may be restarted using a lower heat output capacity if requested by the manufacturer. Alternatively, during the Category IV run, if the rated output cannot be maintained for a 15 minute interval, the manufacturer may elect to reduce the rated output to match the test and complete the Category IV run on this basis. The target outputs for Categories I, II, and III shall then be recalculated based on this change in rated output capacity.</P>

            <P>12.5.5 Additional Test Runs. Using the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity <PRTPAGE P="609"/>as a basis, conduct a test for additional heat output categories as specified in section 4.3. It is not required to run these tests in any particular order.</P>
            <P>12.5.6 Alternative Heat Output Rate for Category I. If an appliance cannot be operated in the Category I heat output range due to stopped combustion, two test runs shall be conducted at heat output rates within Category II. When this is the case, the weightings for the weighted averages indicated in section 14.1.15 shall be the average of the Category I and II weighting's and shall be applied to both Category II results. Appliances that are not capable of operation within Category II (&lt;25 percent of maximum) cannot be evaluated by this test method.</P>
            <P>12.5.6.1 Stopped Fuel Combustion. Evidence that an appliance cannot be operated at a Category I heat output rate due to stopped fuel combustion shall include documentation of two or more attempts to operate the appliance in heat output rate Category I and fuel combustion has stopped prior to complete consumption of the test fuel charge. Stopped fuel combustion is evidenced when an elapsed time of 60 minutes or more has occurred without a measurable (1 lb or 0.5 kg) weight change in the test fuel charge while the appliance operating control is in the demand mode. Report the evidence and the reasoning used to determine that a test in heat output rate Category I cannot be achieved. For example, two unsuccessful attempts to operate at an output rate of 10 percent of the rated output capacity are not sufficient evidence that heat output rate Category I cannot be achieved.</P>
            <P>12.5.7 Appliance Overheating. Appliances with their associated thermal storage shall be capable of operating in all heat output categories without overheating to be rated by this test method. Appliance overheating occurs when the rate of heat withdrawal from the appliance is lower than the rate of heat production when the unit control is in the idle mode. This condition results in the water in the appliance continuing to increase in temperature well above the upper limit setting of the operating control. Evidence of overheating includes: 1 hour or more of appliance water temperature increase above the upper temperature set-point of the operating control, exceeding the temperature limit of a safety control device (independent from the operating control—typically requires manual reset), boiling water in a non-pressurized system or activation of a pressure or temperature relief valve in a pressurized system.</P>
            <P>12.5.8 Option to Eliminate Tests in Category II and III. Following successful completion of a test run in Category I, the manufacturer may eliminate the Category II and III tests. For the purpose of calculating the annual averages for particulates and efficiency, the values obtained in the Category I run shall be assumed to apply also to Category II and Category III. It is envisioned that this option would be applicable to systems which have sufficient thermal storage such that the fuel load in the Category I test can be completely consumed without the system reaching its upper operating temperature limit. In this case, the boiler/heater would likely be operating at maximum thermal output during the entire test and this output rate may be higher than the manufacturer's rated heat output capacity. The Category II and III runs would then be the same as the Category I run. It may be assumed that the particulate emission values and efficiency values determined in the startup, steady-state, and end phases of Category I are applicable in Categories II and III, for the purpose of determining the annual averages in lb/mmBtu and g/MJ (See section 13). For the annual average in g/hr, the length of time for stored heat to be drawn from thermal storage shall be determined for the test load requirements of the respective category.</P>
            <P>12.5.9 Modification to Measurement Procedure in EPA Method 28WHH to Determine Emissions Separately During the Startup, Steady-State and End Phases. With one of the two particulate sampling trains used, filter changes shall be made at the end of the startup phase and the steady-state phase (See section 3.0). This shall be done to determine the particulate emission rate and particulate emission index for the startup, steady-state, and end phases individually. For this one train, the particulates measured during each of these three phases shall be added together to also determine the particulate emissions for the whole run.</P>

            <P>12.5.10 Modification to Measurement Procedure in EPA Method 28WHH and the Standards Referenced therein on Averaging Period for Determination of Efficiency by the Stack Loss Method. The methods currently defined in Method 28WHH allow averaging over 10-minute time periods for flue gas temperature, flue gas CO<E T="52">2</E>, and flue gas CO for the determination of the efficiency with the stack loss method. However, under some cycling conditions the “on” period may be short relative to this 10-minute period. For this reason, during cycling operation the averaging period for these parameters may not be longer than the burner on period divided by 10. The averaging period need not be shorter than one minute. During the off period, under cycling operation, averaging periods as specified in EPA Method 28WHH and the standards referenced therein, may be used. Where short averaging times are used, however, the averaging period for fuel consumption may still be at 10 minutes. This average wood consumption rate shall be applied to all of the smaller time intervals included.<PRTPAGE P="610"/>
            </P>
            <P>12.6 Additional Test Runs. The testing laboratory may conduct more than one test run in each of the heat output categories specified in section 4.3. If more than one test run is conducted at a specified heat output rate, the results from at least two-thirds of the test runs in that heat output rate category shall be used in calculating the weighted average emission rate. The measurement data and results of all test runs shall be reported regardless of which values are used in calculating the weighted average emission rate.</P>

            <P>13.6.5 Determine η<E T="52">SLM</E>—Overall Efficiency, also known as Stack Loss Efficiency, using stack loss method (SLM).</P>

            <P>For determination of the average overall thermal efficiency (η<E T="52">SLM</E>) for the test run, use the data collected over the full test run and the calculations in accordance with CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17), clause 13.7 except for 13.7.2(e), (f), (g), and (h), use the following average fuel properties for oak: %C = 50.0, %H = 6.6, %O = 43.2, %Ash = 0.2.</P>
            <P>13.6.5.1 Whenever the CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see § 60.17) overall efficiency is found to be lower than the overall efficiency based on load side measurements, as determined by Eq. 22 of this method, section 14.1.7 of the test report must include a discussion of the reasons for this result. For a test where the CSA B415.1-10 overall efficiency SLM is less than 2 percentage points lower than the overall efficiency based on load side measurements, the efficiency based on load side measurements shall be considered invalid. [Note on the rationale for the 2 percentage points limit. The SLM method does not include boiler/heater jacket losses and, for this reason, should provide an efficiency which is actually higher than the efficiency based on the energy input and output measurements or “delivered efficiency.” A delivered efficiency that is higher than the efficiency based on the SLM could be considered suspect. A delivered efficiency greater than 2 percentage points higher than the efficiency based on the SLM, then, clearly indicates a measurement error.]</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable to the determination of metals emissions from stationary sources. This method may be used to determine particulate emissions in addition to the metals emissions if the prescribed procedures and precautions are followed.</P>
            <P>1.2.1 Hg emissions can be measured, alternatively, using EPA Method 101A of Appendix B, 40 CFR Part 61. Method 101-A measures only Hg but it can be of special interest to sources which need to measure both Hg and Mn emissions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>2.1 Principle. A stack sample is withdrawn isokinetically from the source, particulate emissions are collected in the probe and on a heated filter, and gaseous emissions are then collected in an aqueous acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide (analyzed for all metals including Hg) and an aqueous acidic solution of potassium permanganate (analyzed only for Hg). The recovered samples are digested, and appropriate fractions are analyzed for Hg by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy <PRTPAGE P="621"/>(CVAAS) and for Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, P, Se, Ag, Tl, and Zn by inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectroscopy (ICAP) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) is used for analysis of Sb, As, Cd, Co, Pb, Se, and Tl if these elements require greater analytical sensitivity than can be obtained by ICAP. If one so chooses, AAS may be used for analysis of all listed metals if the resulting in-stack method detection limits meet the goal of the testing program. Similarly, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) may be used for analysis of Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, Ag, Tl and Zn.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>
            <P>4.1 Iron (Fe) can be a spectral interference during the analysis of As, Cr, and Cd by ICAP. Aluminum (Al) can be a spectral interference during the analysis of As and Pb by ICAP. Generally, these interferences can be reduced by diluting the analytical sample, but such dilution raises the in-stack detection limits. Background and overlap corrections may be used to adjust for spectral interferences. Refer to Method 6010 of Reference 2 in section 16.0 or the other analytical methods used for details on potential interferences to this method. For all GFAAS analyses, use matrix modifiers to limit interferences, and matrix match all standards.</P>

            <P>5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.</P>
            <P>5.2 Corrosive Reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burn as thermal burn.</P>
            <P>5.2.1 Nitric Acid (HNO<E T="52">3</E>). Highly corrosive to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs. Vapors cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Reaction to inhalation may be delayed as long as 30 hours and still be fatal. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Strong oxidizer. Hazardous reaction may occur with organic materials such as solvents.</P>
            <P>5.2.2 Sulfuric Acid (H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>). Rapidly destructive to body tissue. Will cause third degree burns. Eye damage may result in blindness. Inhalation may be fatal from spasm of the larynx, usually within 30 minutes. May cause lung tissue damage with edema. 1 mg/m<SU>3</SU> for 8 hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals and organics.</P>
            <P>5.2.3 Hydrochloric Acid (HC1). Highly corrosive liquid with toxic vapors. Vapors are highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, producing hydrogen gas.</P>
            <P>5.2.4 Hydrofluoric Acid (HF). Highly corrosive to eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs. Reaction to exposure may be delayed by 24 hours or more. Provide ventilation to limit exposure.</P>
            <P>5.2.5 Hydrogen Peroxide (H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E>). Irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs. 30% H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> is a strong oxidizing agent. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and combustible material. Wear gloves when handling.</P>
            <P>5.2.6 Potassium Permanganate (KMnO<E T="52">4</E>). Caustic, strong oxidizer. Avoid bodily contact with.</P>
            <P>5.2.7 Potassium Persulfate. Strong oxidizer. Avoid bodily contact with. Keep containers well closed and in a cool place.</P>

            <P>5.3 Reaction Pressure. Due to the potential reaction of the potassium permanganate with the acid, there could be pressure buildup in the acidic KMnO<E T="52">4</E> absorbing solution storage bottle. Therefore these bottles shall not be fully filled and shall be vented to relieve excess pressure and prevent explosion potentials. Venting is required, but not in a manner that will allow contamination of the solution. A No. 70-72 hole drilled in the container cap and Teflon liner has been used.</P>

Same as Method 5, sections 6.1.1.1 and 6.1.1.2, except that glass nozzles are required unless alternate tips are constructed of materials that are free from contamination and will not interfere with the sample. If a probe tip other than glass is used, no correction to the sample test results to compensate for the nozzle's effect on the sample is allowed. Probe fittings of plastic such as Teflon, polypropylene, etc. are recommended instead of metal fittings to prevent contamination. If one chooses to do so, a single glass piece consisting of a combined probe tip and probe liner may be used.<PRTPAGE P="622"/>

            <P>8.1 Sampling. The complexity of this method is such that, to obtain reliable results, both testers and analysts must be trained and experienced with the test procedures, including source sampling; reagent preparation and handling; sample handling; safety equipment and procedures; analytical calculations; reporting; and the specific procedural descriptions throughout this method.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the same general procedure given in Method 5, section 8.1, except that, unless particulate emissions are to be determined, the filter need not be desiccated or weighed. First, rinse all sampling train glassware with hot tap water and then wash in hot soapy water. Next, rinse glassware three times with tap water, followed by three additional rinses with water. Then soak all glassware in a 10 percent (V/V) nitric acid solution for a minimum of 4 <PRTPAGE P="625"/>hours, rinse three times with water, rinse a final time with acetone, and allow to air dry. Cover all glassware openings where contamination can occur until the sampling train is assembled for sampling.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 5, section 8.1.2.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.1 Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 29-1. Follow the same general procedures given in Method 5, section 8.3, except place 100 ml of the HNO<E T="52">3</E>/H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> solution (Section 7.3.1 of this method) in each of the second and third impingers as shown in Figure 29-1. Place 100 ml of the acidic KMnO<E T="52">4</E> absorbing solution (Section 7.3.2 of this method) in each of the fifth and sixth impingers as shown in Figure 29-1, and transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of pre-weighed silica gel from its container to the last impinger. Alternatively, the silica gel may be weighed directly in the impinger just prior to final train assembly.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.2 Based on the specific source sampling conditions, the use of an empty first impinger can be eliminated if the moisture to be collected in the impingers will be less than approximately 100 ml.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.3 If Hg analysis will not be performed, the fourth, fifth, and sixth impingers as shown in Figure 29-1 are not required.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.4 To insure leak-free sampling train connections and to prevent possible sample contamination problems, use Teflon tape or other non-contaminating material instead of silicone grease.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Precaution:</E> Exercise extreme care to prevent contamination within the train. Prevent the acidic KMnO<E T="52">4</E> from contacting any glassware that contains sample material to be analyzed for Mn.

            <P>8.1.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the procedures given in Method 5, section 8.5. When sampling for Hg, use a procedure analogous to that described in section 8.1 of Method 101A, 40 CFR Part 61, Appendix B, if necessary to maintain the desired color in the last acidified permanganate impinger. For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-3 of Method 5.</P>

            <P>8.2 Sample Recovery.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Begin cleanup procedures as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of a sampling period. The probe should be allowed to cool prior to sample recovery. When it can be safely handled, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a rinsed, non-contaminating cap over the probe nozzle to prevent losing or gaining particulate matter. Do not cap the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling; a vacuum can form in the filter holder with the undesired result of drawing liquid from the impingers onto the filter.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sampling train and cap the open outlet. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Cap the filter inlet where the probe was fastened. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. Cap the filter holder outlet and impinger inlet. Use non-contaminating caps, whether ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, serum caps, or Teflon ® tape to close these openings.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Alternatively, the following procedure may be used to disassemble the train before the probe and filter holder/oven are completely cooled: Initially disconnect the filter holder outlet/impinger inlet and loosely cap the open ends. Then disconnect the probe from the filter holder or cyclone inlet and loosely cap the open ends. Cap the probe tip and remove the umbilical cord as previously described.</P>
            <P>8.2.4 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to a cleanup area that is clean and protected from the wind and other potential causes of contamination or loss of sample. Inspect the train before and during disassembly and note any abnormal conditions. Take special precautions to assure that all the items necessary for recovery do not contaminate the samples. The sample is recovered and treated as follows (see schematic in Figures 29-2a and 29-2b):</P>
            <P>8.2.5 Container No. 1 (Sample Filter). Carefully remove the filter from the filter holder and place it in its labeled petri dish container. To handle the filter, use either acid-washed polypropylene or Teflon coated tweezers or clean, disposable surgical gloves rinsed with water and dried. If it is necessary to fold the filter, make certain the particulate cake is inside the fold. Carefully transfer the filter and any particulate matter or filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket to the petri dish by using a dry (acid-cleaned) nylon bristle brush. Do not use any metal-containing materials when recovering this train. Seal the labeled petri dish.</P>

            <P>8.2.6 Container No. 2 (Acetone Rinse). Perform this procedure only if a determination of particulate emissions is to be made. Quantitatively recover particulate matter and any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, and front half of the filter holder by washing these components with a total of 100 ml of acetone, while simultaneously taking great care to see that no dust on the outside of the probe or other surfaces gets in the sample. The use of exactly 100 ml <PRTPAGE P="626"/>is necessary for the subsequent blank correction procedures. Distilled water may be used instead of acetone when approved by the Administrator and shall be used when specified by the Administrator; in these cases, save a water blank and follow the Administrator's directions on analysis.</P>
            <P>8.2.6.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle, and clean the inside surface by rinsing with acetone from a wash bottle while brushing with a non-metallic brush. Brush until the acetone rinse shows no visible particles, then make a final rinse of the inside surface with acetone.</P>
            <P>8.2.6.2 Brush and rinse the sample exposed inside parts of the probe fitting with acetone in a similar way until no visible particles remain. Rinse the probe liner with acetone by tilting and rotating the probe while squirting acetone into its upper end so that all inside surfaces will be wetted with acetone. Allow the acetone to drain from the lower end into the sample container. A funnel may be used to aid in transferring liquid washings to the container. Follow the acetone rinse with a non-metallic probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, squirt acetone into the upper end as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action three times through the probe. Hold a sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any acetone and particulate matter which is brushed through the probe until no visible particulate matter is carried out with the acetone or until none remains in the probe liner on visual inspection. Rinse the brush with acetone, and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final acetone rinse of the probe as described above.</P>
            <P>8.2.6.3 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination. Clean the inside of the front-half of the filter holder by rubbing the surfaces with a non-metallic brush and rinsing with acetone. Rinse each surface three times or more if needed to remove visible particulate. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. After all acetone washings and particulate matter have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid so that acetone will not leak out when shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether or not leakage occurred during transport. Clearly label the container to identify its contents.</P>

            <P>8.2.7 Container No. 3 (Probe Rinse). Keep the probe assembly clean and free from contamination during the probe rinse. Rinse the probe nozzle and fitting, probe liner, and front-half of the filter holder thoroughly with a total of 100 ml of 0.1 N HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and place the wash into a sample storage container. Perform the rinses as applicable and generally as described in Method 12, section 8.7.1. Record the volume of the rinses. Mark the height of the fluid level on the outside of the storage container and use this mark to determine if leakage occurs during transport. Seal the container, and clearly label the contents. Finally, rinse the nozzle, probe liner, and front-half of the filter holder with water followed by acetone, and discard these rinses.

Transfer the silica gel from its impinger to its original container and seal it. The tester may use a funnel to pour the silica gel and a rubber policeman to remove the silica gel from the impinger. The small amount of particles that might adhere to the impinger wall need not be removed. Do not use water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel since weight gained in the silica gel impinger is used for moisture calculations. Alternatively, if a balance is available in the field, record the weight of the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g.</P>
            <P>8.2.11 Container No. 7 (Acetone Blank). If particulate emissions are to be determined, at least once during each field test, place a 100-ml portion of the acetone used in the sample recovery process into a container labeled No. 7. Seal the container.</P>

            <P>8.3 Sample Preparation. Note the level of the liquid in each of the containers and determine if any sample was lost during shipment. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. A diagram illustrating sample preparation and analysis procedures for each of the sample train components is shown in Figure 29-3.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Container No. 1 (Sample Filter).</P>
            <P>8.3.1.1 If particulate emissions are being determined, first desiccate the filter and filter catch without added heat (do not heat the filters to speed the drying) and weigh to a constant weight as described in section 11.2.1 of Method 5.</P>

            <P>8.3.1.2 Following this procedure, or initially, if particulate emissions are not being determined in addition to metals analysis, divide the filter with its filter catch into portions containing approximately 0.5 g each. Place the pieces in the analyst's choice of either individual microwave pressure relief vessels or Parr Bombs. Add 6 ml of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E> and 4 ml of concentrated HF to each vessel. For microwave heating, microwave the samples for approximately 12 to 15 minutes total heating time as follows: heat for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn off the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, then heat for 2 to 3 minutes, etc., continue this alternation until the 12 to 15 minutes total heating time are completed (this procedure should comprise approximately 24 to 30 minutes at 600 watts). Microwave heating times are approximate and are dependent upon the number of samples being digested simultaneously. Sufficient heating is evidenced by sorbent reflux within the vessel. For conventional heating, heat the Parr Bombs at 140 °C (285 °F) for 6 hours. Then cool the samples to <PRTPAGE P="628"/>room temperature, and combine with the acid digested probe rinse as required in section 8.3.3.</P>
            <P>8.3.1.3 If the sampling train includes an optional glass cyclone in front of the filter, prepare and digest the cyclone catch by the procedures described in section 8.3.1.2 and then combine the digestate with the digested filter sample.</P>

            <P>8.3.2 Container No. 2 (Acetone Rinse). Note the level of liquid in the container and confirm on the analysis sheet whether or not leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Measure the liquid in this container either volumetrically within 1 ml or gravimetrically within 0.5 g. Transfer the contents to an acid-cleaned, tared 250-ml beaker and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. If particulate emissions are being determined, desiccate for 24 hours without added heat, weigh to a constant weight according to the procedures described in section 11.2.1 of Method 5, and report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. Redissolve the residue with 10 ml of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E>. Quantitatively combine the resultant sample, including all liquid and any particulate matter, with Container No. 3 before beginning section 8.3.3.</P>

            <P>8.3.3 Container No. 3 (Probe Rinse). Verify that the pH of this sample is 2 or lower. If it is not, acidify the sample by careful addition with stirring of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E> to pH 2. Use water to rinse the sample into a beaker, and cover the beaker with a ribbed watch glass. Reduce the sample volume to approximately 20 ml by heating on a hot plate at a temperature just below boiling. Digest the sample in microwave vessels or Parr Bombs by quantitatively transferring the sample to the vessel or bomb, carefully adding the 6 ml of concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E>, 4 ml of concentrated HF, and then continuing to follow the procedures described in section 8.3.1.2. Then combine the resultant sample directly with the acid digested portions of the filter prepared previously in section 8.3.1.2. The resultant combined sample is referred to as <E T="03">“Sample Fraction 1”.</E> Filter the combined sample using Whatman 541 filter paper. Dilute to 300 ml (or the appropriate volume for the expected metals concentration) with water. This diluted sample is <E T="03">“Analytical Fraction 1”.</E> Measure and record the volume of Analytical Fraction 1 to within 0.1 ml. Quantitatively remove a 50-ml aliquot and label as <E T="03">“Analytical Fraction 1B”.</E> Label the remaining 250-ml portion as <E T="03">“Analytical Fraction 1A”.</E> Analytical Fraction 1A is used for ICAP or AAS analysis for all desired metals except Hg. Analytical Fraction 1B is used for the determination of front-half Hg.</P>

            <P>8.3.4 Container No. 4 (Impingers 1-3). Measure and record the total volume of this sample to within 0.5 ml and label it <E T="03">“Sample Fraction 2”.</E> Remove a 75- to 100-ml aliquot for Hg analysis and label the aliquot <E T="03">“Analytical Fraction 2B”.</E> Label the remaining portion of Container No. 4 as <E T="03">“Sample Fraction 2A”.</E> Sample Fraction 2A defines the volume of Analytical Fraction 2A <E T="03">prior</E> to digestion. All of Sample Fraction 2A is digested to produce <E T="03">“Analytical Fraction 2A”.</E> Analytical Fraction 2A defines the volume of Sample Fraction 2A <E T="03">after</E> its digestion and the volume of Analytical Fraction 2A is normally 150 ml. Analytical Fraction 2A is analyzed for all metals except Hg. Verify that the pH of Sample Fraction 2A is 2 or lower. If necessary, use concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E> by careful addition and stirring to lower Sample Fraction 2A to pH 2. Use water to rinse Sample Fraction 2A into a beaker and then cover the beaker with a ribbed watchglass. Reduce Sample Fraction 2A to approximately 20 ml by heating on a hot plate at a temperature just below boiling. Then follow either of the digestion procedures described in sections 8.3.4.1 or 8.3.4.2.</P>

            <P>8.3.4.1 Conventional Digestion Procedure. Add 30 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E>, and heat for 30 minutes on a hot plate to just below boiling.

Cool, filter the sample, and dilute to 150 ml (or the appropriate volume for the expected metals concentrations) with water. This dilution produces Analytical Fraction 2A. Measure and record the volume to within 0.1 ml.</P>

            <P>8.3.4.2 Microwave Digestion Procedure. Add 10 ml of 50 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E> and heat for 6 minutes total <E T="03">heating</E> time in alternations of 1 to 2 minutes at 600 Watts followed by 1 to 2 minutes with no power, etc., similar to the procedure described in section 8.3.1. Allow the sample to cool. Add 10 ml of 3 percent H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> and heat for 2 more minutes. Add 50 ml of hot water, and heat for an additional 5 minutes. Cool, filter the sample, and dilute to 150 ml (or the appropriate volume for the expected metals concentrations) with water. This dilution produces Analytical Fraction 2A. Measure and record the volume to within 0.1 ml.

Place the saved filter, which was used to remove the brown MnO<E T="52">2</E> precipitate, into an appropriately sized <E T="03">vented</E> container, which will allow release of any gases including chlorine formed when the filter is digested. In a laboratory hood which will remove any gas produced by the digestion of the MnO<E T="52">2</E>, add 25 ml of 8 N HCl to the filter and allow to digest for a minimum of 24 hours at room temperature. Filter the contents of Container No. 5C through a Whatman 40 filter into a 500-ml volumetric flask. Then filter the result of the digestion of the brown MnO<E T="52">2</E> from Container No. 5B through a Whatman 40 filter into the same 500-ml volumetric flask, and dilute and mix well to volume with water. Discard the Whatman 40 filter. Mark this combined 500-ml dilute HCl solution as Analytical Fraction 3C.</P>

            <P>10.5 Analytical Balance Calibration. Perform a multipoint calibration (at least five points spanning the operational range) of the analytical balance before the first use, and semiannually thereafter. The calibration of the analytical balance must be conducted using ASTM E617-13 “Standard Specification for Laboratory Weights and Precision Mass Standards” (incorporated by reference—see 40 CFR 60.17) Class 2 (or better) tolerance weights. Audit the balance each day it is used for gravimetric measurements by weighing at least one ASTM E617-13 Class 2 tolerance (or better) calibration weight that corresponds to 50 to 150 percent of the weight of one filter or between 1g and 5g. If the scale cannot reproduce the value of the calibration weight to within 0.5 mg of the certified mass, perform corrective measures, and conduct the multipoint calibration before use.</P>

            <P>11.1 Sample Analysis. For each sampling train sample run, seven individual analytical samples are generated; two for all desired metals except Hg, and five for Hg. A schematic identifying each sample container and the prescribed analytical preparation and analysis scheme is shown in Figure 29-3. The first two analytical samples, labeled Analytical Fractions 1A and 1B, consist of the digested samples from the front-half of the train. Analytical Fraction 1A is for ICAP, ICP-MS or AAS analysis as described in sections 11.1.1 and 11.1.2, respectively. Analytical Fraction 1B is for front-half Hg analysis as described in section 11.1.3. The contents of the back-half of the train are used to prepare the third through seventh analytical samples. The third and fourth analytical samples, labeled Analytical Fractions 2A and 2B, contain the samples from the moisture removal impinger No. 1, if used, and HNO<E T="52">3</E>/H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> impingers Nos. 2 and 3. Analytical Fraction 2A is for ICAP, ICP-MS or AAS analysis for target metals, except Hg. Analytical Fraction 2B is for analysis for Hg. The fifth through seventh analytical samples, labeled Analytical Fractions 3A, 3B, and 3C, consist of the impinger contents and rinses from the empty impinger No. 4 and the H<E T="52">2</E>SO<E T="52">4</E>/KMnO<E T="52">4</E> Impingers Nos. 5 and 6. These analytical samples are for analysis for Hg as described in section 11.1.3. The total back-half Hg catch is determined from the sum of Analytical Fractions 2B, 3A, 3B, and 3C. Analytical Fractions 1A and 2A can be combined proportionally prior to analysis.</P>

            <P>11.1.1 ICAP and ICP-MS Analysis. Analyze Analytical Fractions 1A and 2A by ICAP using Method 6010 or Method 200.7 (40 CFR 136, Appendix C). Calibrate the ICAP, and set up an analysis program as described in Method 6010 or Method 200.7. Follow the quality control procedures described in section 9.2.1. Recommended wavelengths for analysis are as shown in Table 29-2. These wavelengths represent the best combination of specificity <PRTPAGE P="631"/>and potential detection limit. Other wavelengths may be substituted if they can provide the needed specificity and detection limit, and are treated with the same corrective techniques for spectral interference. Initially, analyze all samples for the target metals (except Hg) plus Fe and Al. If Fe and Al are present, the sample might have to be diluted so that each of these elements is at a concentration of less than 50 ppm so as to reduce their spectral interferences on As, Cd, Cr, and Pb. Perform ICP-MS analysis by following Method 6020 in EPA Publication SW-846 Third Edition (November 1986) including updates I, II, IIA, IIB and III, as incorporated by reference in § 60.17(i).

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>When analyzing samples in a HF matrix, an alumina torch should be used; since all front-half samples will contain HF, use an alumina torch.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>11.1.2 AAS by Direct Aspiration and/or GFAAS. If analysis of metals in Analytical Fractions 1A and 2A by using GFAAS or direct aspiration AAS is needed, use Table 29-3 to determine which techniques and procedures to apply for each target metal. Use Table 29-3, if necessary, to determine techniques for minimization of interferences. Calibrate the instrument according to section 10.3 and follow the quality control procedures specified in section 9.2.2.</P>

            <P>11.1.3 CVAAS Hg analysis. Analyze Analytical Fractions 1B, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 3C separately for Hg using CVAAS following the method outlined in Method 7470 in EPA Publication SW-846 Third Edition (November 1986) including updates I, II, IIA, IIB and III, as incorporated by reference in § 60.17(i), or in <E T="03">Standard Methods for Water and Wastewater Analysis,</E> 15th Edition, Method 303F, or, optionally using note no. 2 at the end of this section. Set up the calibration curve (zero to 1000 ng) as described in Method 7470 or similar to Method 303F using 300-ml BOD bottles instead of Erlenmeyers. Perform the following for each Hg analysis. From each original sample, select and record an aliquot in the size range from 1 ml to 10 ml. If no prior knowledge of the expected amount of Hg in the sample exists, a 5 ml aliquot is suggested for the first dilution to 100 ml (see note no. 1 at end of this section). The total amount of Hg in the aliquot shall be less than 1 µg and within the range (zero to 1000 ng) of the calibration curve. Place the sample aliquot into a separate 300-ml BOD bottle, and add enough water to make a total volume of 100 ml. Next add to it sequentially the sample digestion solutions and perform the sample preparation described in the procedures of Method 7470 or Method 303F. (See note no. 2 at the end of this section). If the maximum readings are off-scale (because Hg in the aliquot exceeded the calibration range; including the situation where only a 1-ml aliquot of the original sample was digested), then dilute the original sample (or a portion of it) with 0.15 percent HNO<E T="52">3</E> (1.5 ml concentrated HNO<E T="52">3</E> per liter aqueous solution) so that when a 1- to 10-ml aliquot of the “0.15 HNO<E T="52">3</E> percent dilution of the original sample” is digested and analyzed by the procedures described above, it will yield an analysis within the range of the calibration curve.

              <P>Optionally, Hg can be analyzed by using the CVAAS analytical procedures given by some instrument manufacturer's directions. These include calibration and quality control procedures for the Leeman Model PS200, the Perkin Elmer FIAS systems, and similar models, if available, of other instrument manufacturers. For digestion and analyses by these instruments, perform the following two steps: (1), Digest the sample aliquot through the addition of the aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride/sodium chloride solution the same as described in this section: (<E T="03">The Leeman, Perkin Elmer, and similar instruments described in this note add automatically the necessary stannous chloride solution during the automated analysis of Hg.)</E>; (2), Upon completion of the digestion described in (1), analyze the sample according to the instrument manufacturer's directions. This approach allows multiple (including duplicate) automated analyses of a digested sample aliquot.</P>

Samples containing greater than approximately 50 µg/ml As, Cr, or Pb should be diluted to that level or lower for final analysis. Samples containing greater than approximately 20 µg/ml of Cd should be diluted to that level before analysis.</P>
            <P>13.2 Analytical Detection Limits.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>See section 13.3 for the description of in-stack detection limits.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>13.2.1 ICAP analytical detection limits for the sample solutions (based on <E T="03">SW-846,</E> Method 6010) are approximately as follows: Sb (32 ng/ml), As (53 ng/ml), Ba (2 ng/ml), Be (0.3 ng/ml), Cd (4 ng/ml), Cr (7 ng/ml), Co (7 ng/ml), Cu (6 ng/ml), Pb (42 ng/ml), Mn (2 ng/ml), Ni (15 ng/ml), P (75 ng/ml), Se (75 ng/ml), Ag (7 ng/ml), Tl (40 ng/ml), and Zn (2 ng/ml). ICP-MS analytical detection limits (based on <E T="03">SW-846,</E> Method 6020) are lower generally by a factor of ten or more. Be is lower by a factor of three. The actual sample analytical detection limits are sample dependent and may vary due to the sample matrix.</P>

            <P>13.2.2 The analytical detection limits for analysis by direct aspiration AAS (based on <E T="03">SW-846</E>, Method 7000 series) are approximately as follows: Sb (200 ng/ml), As (2 ng/ml), Ba (100 ng/ml), Be (5 ng/ml), Cd (5 ng/ml), Cr (50 ng/ml), Co (50 ng/ml), Cu (20 ng/ml), Pb (100 ng/ml), Mn (10 ng/ml), Ni (40 ng/ml), Se (2 ng/ml), Ag (10 ng/ml), Tl (100 ng/ml), and Zn (5 ng/ml).</P>

            <P>13.2.3 The detection limit for Hg by CVAAS (on the resultant volume of the <E T="03">digestion</E> of the aliquots taken for Hg analyses) can be approximately 0.02 to 0.2 ng/ml, depending upon the type of CVAAS analytical instrument used. 13.2.4 The use of GFAAS can enhance the detection limits compared to direct aspiration AAS as follows: Sb (3 ng/ml), As (1 ng/ml), Be (0.2 ng/ml), Cd (0.1 ng/ml), Cr (1 ng/ml), Co (1 ng/ml), Pb (1 ng/ml), Se (2 ng/ml), and Tl (1 ng/ml).</P>
            <P>13.3 In-stack Detection Limits.</P>

            <P>13.3.1 For test planning purposes in-stack detection limits can be developed by using the following information: (1) The procedures described in this method, (2) the analytical detection limits described in section 13.2 and in <E T="03">SW-846,</E>(3) the normal volumes of 300 ml (Analytical Fraction 1) for the front-half and 150 ml (Analytical Fraction 2A) for the back-half samples, and (4) a stack gas sample volume of 1.25 m<SU>3</SU>. The resultant in-stack method detection limits for the above set of conditions are presented in Table 29-1 and were calculated by using Eq. 29-1 shown in section 12.5.</P>
            <P>13.3.2 To ensure optimum precision/resolution in the analyses, the target concentrations of metals in the analytical solutions should be at least ten times their respective analytical detection limits. Under certain conditions, and with greater care in the analytical procedure, these concentrations can be as low as approximately three times the respective analytical detection limits without seriously impairing the precision of the analyses. On at least one sample run in the source test, and for each metal analyzed, perform either repetitive analyses, Method of Standard Additions, serial dilution, or matrix spike addition, etc., to document the quality of the data.</P>

            <P>13.3.3 Actual in-stack method detection limits are based on actual source sampling parameters and analytical results as described above. If required, the method in-stack detection limits can be improved over those shown in Table 29-1 for a specific test by either increasing the sampled stack gas volume, reducing the total volume of the digested samples, improving the analytical detection limits, or any combination of the three. For extremely low levels of <E T="03">Hg only,</E> the aliquot size selected for digestion and analysis can be increased to as much as 10 ml, thus improving the in-stack detection limit by a factor of ten compared to a 1 ml aliquot size.</P>
            <P>13.3.3.1 A nominal one hour sampling run will collect a stack gas sampling volume of about 1.25 m<SU>3</SU>. If the sampling time is increased to four hours and 5 m<SU>3</SU> are collected, the in-stack method detection limits would be improved by a factor of four compared to the values shown in Table 29-1.</P>

            <P>13.3.3.2 The in-stack detection limits assume that all of the sample is digested and the final liquid volumes for analysis are the normal values of 300 ml for Analytical Fraction 1, and 150 ml for Analytical Fraction 2A. If the volume of Analytical Fraction 1 is reduced from 300 to 30 ml, the in-stack detection limits for that fraction of the sample would be improved by a factor of ten. If the volume of Analytical Fraction 2A is reduced from 150 to 25 ml, the in-stack detection limits for that fraction of the sample would be improved by a factor of six. Matrix effect checks are necessary on sample analyses and typically are of much greater significance for samples that have been concentrated to <PRTPAGE P="635"/>less than the normal original sample volume. Reduction of Analytical Fractions 1 and 2A to volumes of less than 30 and 25 ml, respectively, could interfere with the redissolving of the residue and could increase interference by other compounds to an intolerable level.</P>
            <P>13.3.3.3 When both of the modifications described in sections 13.3.3.1 and 13.3.3.2 are used simultaneously on one sample, the resultant improvements are multiplicative. For example, an increase in stack gas volume by a factor of four and a reduction in the total liquid sample digested volume of both Analytical Fractions 1 and 2A by a factor of six would result in an improvement by a factor of twenty-four of the in-stack method detection limit.</P>

            <P>13.4 Precision. The precision (relative standard deviation) for each metal detected in a method development test performed at a sewage sludge incinerator were found to be as follows:
            </P>
            <FP>Sb (12.7 percent), As (13.5 percent), Ba (20.6 percent), Cd (11.5 percent), Cr (11.2 percent), Cu (11.5 percent), Pb (11.6 percent), P (14.6 percent), Se (15.3 percent), Tl (12.3 percent), and Zn (11.8 percent). The precision for Ni was 7.7 percent for another test conducted at a source simulator. Be, Mn, and Ag were not detected in the tests. However, based on the analytical detection limits of the ICAP for these metals, their precisions could be similar to those for the other metals when detected at similar levels.</FP>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">What Is Method 30A?</HD>

            <P>Method 30A is a procedure for measuring total vapor phase mercury (Hg) emissions from stationary sources using an instrumental analyzer. This method is particularly appropriate for performing emissions testing and for conducting relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) of mercury continuous emissions monitoring systems (Hg CEMS) and sorbent trap monitoring systems at coal-fired combustion sources. Quality assurance and quality control requirements are included to assure that you, the tester, collect <PRTPAGE P="642"/>data of known and acceptable quality for each testing site. This method does not completely describe all equipment, supplies, and sampling procedures and analytical procedures you will need but refers to other test methods for some of the details. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, you should also have a thorough knowledge of these additional methods which are also found in appendices A-1 and A-3 to this part:</P>
            <P>(a) Method 1—Sample and Velocity Traverses for Stationary Sources.</P>
            <P>(b) Method 4—Determination of Moisture Content in Stack Gases.</P>

            <P>1.1 Analytes. What does this method determine? This method is designed to measure the mass concentration of total vapor phase Hg in flue gas, which represents the sum of elemental Hg (Hg<SU>0</SU>) and oxidized forms of Hg (Hg<E T="51">+2</E>), in mass concentration units of micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. When is this method required? Method 30A is offered as a reference method for emission testing and for RATAs of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems at coal-fired boilers. Method 30A may also be specified for other source categories in the future, either by New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), emissions trading programs, State Implementation Plans (SIP), or operating permits that require measurement of Hg concentrations in stationary source emissions to determine compliance with an applicable emission standard or limit, or to conduct RATAs of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives (DQO). How good must my collected data be? Method 30A has been designed to provide data of high and known quality for Hg emission testing and for relative accuracy testing of Hg monitoring systems including Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems. In these and other applications, the principle objective is to ensure the accuracy of the data at the actual emission levels encountered. To meet this objective, calibration standards prepared according to an EPA traceability protocol must be used and measurement system performance tests are required.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>

            <P>In this method, a sample of the effluent gas is continuously extracted and conveyed to an analyzer capable of measuring the total vapor phase Hg concentration. Elemental and oxidized mercury (i.e., Hg<SU>0</SU> and Hg<E T="51">+2</E>) may be measured separately or simultaneously but, for purposes of this method, total vapor phase Hg is the sum of Hg<SU>0</SU> and Hg<E T="51">+2</E>. You must meet the performance requirements of this method (i.e., system calibration, interference testing, dynamic spiking, and system integrity/drift checks) to validate your data. The dynamic spiking requirement is deferred until January 1, 2009.</P>

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations concerning use of compressed gas cylinders and noxious gases may apply.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>6.1 What do I need for the measurement system? This method is intended to be applicable to multiple instrumental technologies. You may use any equipment and supplies that meet the following specifications.</P>

            <P>6.1.1 All wetted sampling system components, including probe components prior to the point at which the calibration gas is introduced, must be chemically inert to all Hg species. Materials such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) Teflon <SU>TM</SU>, quartz, treated stainless steel (SS) are examples of such materials. [<E T="04">Note:</E> These materials of construction are required because components prior to the calibration gas injection point are not included in the system calibration error, system integrity, and interference tests.]</P>
            <P>6.1.2 The interference, system calibration error, system integrity, drift and dynamic spiking test criteria must all be met by the system used.</P>
            <P>6.1.3 The system must be capable of measuring and controlling sample flow rate.</P>
            <P>6.1.4 All system components prior to the Hg<E T="51">+2</E> to Hg<SU>0</SU> converter must be maintained at a sample temperature above the acid gas dew point.</P>
            <P>6.2 Measurement System Components. Figure 30A-1 in section 17.0 is an example schematic of a Method 30A measurement system.</P>
            <P>6.2.1 Sample Probe. The probe must be made of the appropriate materials as noted in section 6.1.1, heated when necessary (see section 6.1.4), configured with ports for introduction of calibration and spiking gases, and of sufficient length to traverse all of the sample points.</P>
            <P>6.2.2 Filter or Other Particulate Removal Device. The filter or other particulate removal device is considered to be a part of the measurement system, must be made of appropriate materials as noted in section 6.1.1, and must be included in all system tests.</P>
            <P>6.2.3 Sample Line. The sample line that connects the probe to the converter, conditioning system and analyzer must be made of appropriate materials as noted in section 6.1.1.</P>

            <P>6.2.4 Conditioning Equipment. For dry basis measurements, a condenser, dryer or other suitable device is required to remove moisture continuously from the sample gas. Any equipment needed to heat the probe, or sample line to avoid condensation prior to the moisture removal component is also required. For wet basis systems, you must keep the sample above its dew point either by: (1) Heating the sample line and all sample transport components up to the inlet of <PRTPAGE P="644"/>the analyzer (and, for hot-wet extractive systems, also heating the analyzer) or (2) by diluting the sample prior to analysis using a dilution probe system. The components required to do either of the above are considered to be conditioning equipment.</P>
            <P>6.2.5 Sampling Pump. A pump is needed to push or pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system. If a mechanical sample pump is used and its surfaces are in contact with the sample gas prior to detection, the pump must be leak free and must be constructed of a material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled (see section 6.1.1). For dilution-type measurement systems, an ejector pump (eductor) may be used to create a sufficient vacuum that sample gas will be drawn through a critical orifice at a constant rate. The ejector pump may be constructed of any material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled.</P>
            <P>6.2.6 Calibration Gas System(s). One or more systems may be needed to introduce calibration gases into the measurement system. A system should be able to flood the sampling probe sufficiently to prevent entry of gas from the effluent stream.</P>
            <P>6.2.7 Dynamic Spiking Port. For the purposes of the dynamic spiking procedure described in section 8.2.7, the measurement system must be equipped with a port to allow introduction of the dynamic spike gas stream with the sample gas stream, at a point as close as possible to the inlet of the probe so as to ensure adequate mixing. The same port used for system calibrations and calibration error checks may be used for dynamic spiking purposes.</P>
            <P>6.2.8 Sample Gas Delivery. The sample line may feed directly to a converter, to a by-pass valve (for speciating systems), or to a sample manifold. All valve and/or manifold components must be made of material that is non-reactive to the gas sampled and the calibration gas, and must be configured to safely discharge any excess gas.</P>
            <P>6.2.9 Hg Analyzer. An instrument is required that continuously measures the total vapor phase Hg in the gas stream and meets the applicable specifications in section 13.0.</P>
            <P>6.2.10 Data Recorder. A recorder, such as a computerized data acquisition and handling system (DAHS), digital recorder, strip chart, or data logger, is required for recording measurement data.</P>
            <P>6.3 Moisture Measurement System. If correction of the measured Hg emissions for moisture is required (see section 8.5), either Method 4 in appendix A-3 to this part or other moisture measurement methods approved by the Administrator will be needed to measure stack gas moisture content.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>

            <P>7.1 Calibration Gases. What calibration gases do I need? You will need calibration gases of known concentrations of Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E>. Special reagents and equipment may be required to prepare the HgCl<SU>2</SU> gas standards (e.g., a NIST-traceable solution of HgCl<E T="52">2</E> and a gas generator equipped with mass flow controllers).</P>
            <P>The following calibration gas concentrations are required:</P>
            <P>7.1.1 High-Level Gas. Equal to the selected calibration span.</P>
            <P>7.1.2 Mid-Level Gas. 40 to 60 percent of the calibration span.</P>
            <P>7.1.3 Low-Level Gas. 10 to 30 percent of the calibration span.</P>
            <P>7.1.4 Zero Gas. No detectable Hg.</P>

            <P>7.1.5 Dynamic Spike Gas. The exact concentration of the HgCl<E T="52">2</E> calibration gas used to perform the pre-test dynamic spiking procedure described in section 8.2.7 depends on the native Hg concentration in the stack The spike gas must produce a spiked sample concentration above the native concentration, as specified in section 8.2.7.2.2.</P>
            <P>7.2 Interference Test. What reagents do I need for the interference test? Use the appropriate test gases listed in Table 30A-3 in section 17.0 (i.e., the potential interferents for the source to be tested, as identified by the instrument manufacturer) to conduct the interference check. These gases need not be of protocol gas quality.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Sample Collection</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Emission Test Procedure</HD>
            <P>Figure 30A-2 in section 17.0 presents an overview of the test procedures required by this method. Since you may choose different options to comply with certain performance criteria, you must identify the specific options and associated frequencies you select and document your results in regard to the performance criteria.</P>
            <P>8.1 Selection of Sampling Sites and Sampling Points. What sampling site and sampling points do I select?</P>
            <P>8.1.1 When this method is used solely for Hg emission testing (e.g., to determine compliance with an emission standard or limit), use twelve sampling points located according to Table 1-1 or Table 1-2 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. Alternatively, you may conduct a stratification test as described in section 8.1.3 to determine the number and location of the sampling points.</P>

            <P>8.1.2 When this method is used for relative accuracy testing of a Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system, follow the sampling <PRTPAGE P="645"/>site selection and sampling point layout procedures for gas monitor RATA testing described in the appropriate performance specification or applicable regulation (e.g., Performance Specification 2, section 8.1.3 of appendix B to this part or section 6.5.6 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter), with one exception. If you elect to perform stratification testing as part of the sampling point selection process, perform the testing in accordance with section 8.1.3 of this method (see also “Summary Table of QA/QC Requirements” in section 9.0).</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Determination of Stratification. If you elect to perform stratification testing as part of the sampling point selection process and the test results show your effluent gas stream to be unstratified or minimally stratified, you may be allowed to sample at fewer points or at different points than would otherwise be required.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.1 Test Procedure. To test for stratification, use a probe of appropriate length to measure the total vapor phase Hg concentration at twelve traverse points located according to Table 1-1 or Table 1-2 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. Alternatively, for a sampling location where stratification is expected (e.g., after a wet scrubber or at a point where dissimilar gas streams are combined together), if a 12-point Hg stratification test has been previously performed at that location and the results of the test showed the location to be minimally stratified or unstratified according to the criteria in section 8.1.3.2, you may perform an abbreviated 3-point or 6-point Hg stratification test at the points specified in section 6.5.6.2(a) of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter in lieu of performing the 12-point test. Sample for a minimum of twice the system response time (see section 8.2.6) at each traverse point. Calculate the individual point and mean Hg concentrations.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.2 Acceptance Criteria and Sampling Point Location.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.2.1 If the Hg concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by no more than: (a) ±5 percent of the mean concentration; or (b) ±0.2 µg/m<SU>3</SU> (whichever is less restrictive), the gas stream is considered to be unstratified and you may collect samples from a single point that most closely matches the mean.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.2.2 If the 5 percent or 0.2 µg/m<SU>3</SU> criterion in section 8.1.3.2.1 is not met, but the Hg concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by no more than: (a)±10 percent of the mean; or (b)±0.5 µg/m<SU>3</SU> (whichever is less restrictive), the gas stream is considered to be minimally stratified, and you may take samples from three points, provided the points are located on the measurement line exhibiting the highest average Hg concentration during the stratification test. If the stack diameter (or equivalent diameter, for a rectangular stack or duct) is greater than 2.4 meters (7.8 ft), locate the three sampling points at 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. Alternatively, if a RATA required by part 75 of this chapter is being conducted, you may locate the three points at 4.4, 14.6, and 29.6 percent of the duct diameter, in accordance with Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. For stack or duct diameters of 2.4 meters (7.8 ft) or less, locate the three sampling points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line.</P>
            <P>8.1.3.2.3 If the gas stream is found to be stratified because the 10 percent or 0.5 µg/m<SU>3</SU> criterion in section 8.1.3.2.2 is not met, then either locate three sampling points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line that exhibited the highest average Hg concentration during the stratification test, or locate twelve traverse points for the test in accordance with Table 1-1 or Table 1-2 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part; or, if a RATA required by part 75 of this chapter is being conducted, locate six Method 1 points along the measurement line that exhibited the highest average Hg concentration.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.3 Temporal Variations. Temporal variations in the source Hg concentration during a stratification test may complicate the determination of stratification. If temporal variations are a concern, you may use the following procedure to normalize the stratification test data. A second Hg measurement system, i.e., either an installed Hg CEMS or another Method 30A system, is required to perform this procedure. Position the sampling probe of the second Hg measurement system at a fixed point in the stack or duct, at least one meter from the stack or duct wall. Then, each time that the Hg concentration is measured at one of the stratification test points, make a concurrent measurement of Hg concentration at the fixed point. Normalize the Hg concentration measured at each traverse point, by multiplying it by the ratio of C<E T="52">F,avg</E> to C<E T="52">F</E>, where C<E T="52">F</E> is the corresponding fixed-point Hg concentration measurement, and C<E T="52">F,avg</E> is the average of all of the fixed-point measurements over the duration of the stratification test. Evaluate the results of the stratification test according to section 8.1.3.2, using the normalized Hg concentrations.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.4 Stratification Testing Exemption. Stratification testing need not be performed at a test location where it would otherwise be required to justify using fewer sample points or different sample points, if the owner or operator documents that the Hg concentration in the stack gas is expected to be 3 µg/m<SU>3</SU> or less at the time of a Hg monitoring system RATA or an Hg emissions test. To demonstrate that a particular test location qualifies for the stratification testing exemption, representative Hg emissions data must be collected just prior to the RATA or <PRTPAGE P="646"/>emissions test. At least one hour of Hg concentration data is required for the demonstration. The data used for the demonstration shall be recorded at process operating conditions that closely approximate the operating conditions that will exist during the RATA or emissions test. It is recommended that collection of the demonstration data be integrated with the on-site pretest procedures required by the reference method being used for the RATA or emissions test (whether this method or another approved Hg reference method is used). Quality-assured data from an installed Hg monitoring system may also be used for the demonstration. If a particular test location qualifies for the stratification testing exemption, sampling shall be performed at three points, as described in section 8.1.3.2.2 of this method. The owner or operator shall fully document the method used to collect the demonstration data and shall keep this documentation on file with the data from the associated RATA or Hg emissions test.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.5 Interim Alternative Stratification Test Procedures. In the time period between the effective date of this method and January 1, 2009, you may follow one of the following two procedures. Substitute a stratification test for sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>) for the Hg stratification test described in section 8.1.3.1. If this option is chosen, follow the test procedures in section 6.5.6.1 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. Evaluate the test results and determine the sampling point locations according to section 6.5.6.3 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. If the sampling location is found to be minimally stratified or unstratified for SO<E T="52">2</E>, it shall be considered minimally stratified or unstratified for Hg. Alternatively, you may forgo stratification testing, assume the gas stream is minimally stratified, and sample at three points as described in section 8.1.3.2.2 of this method.</P>
            <P>8.2 Initial Measurement System Performance Tests. What initial performance criteria must my system meet before I begin sampling? Before measuring emissions, perform the following procedures:</P>
            <P>(a) Interference Test;</P>
            <P>(b) Calibration Gas Verification;</P>
            <P>(c) Measurement System Preparation;</P>
            <P>(d) 3-Point System Calibration Error Test;</P>
            <P>(e) System Integrity Check;</P>
            <P>(f) Measurement System Response Time Test; and</P>
            <P>(g) Dynamic Spiking Test.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Interference Test (Optional). Your measurement system should be free of known interferences. It is recommended that you conduct this interference test of your measurement system prior to its initial use in the field to verify that the candidate test instrument is free from inherent biases or interferences resulting from common combustion emission constituents. If you have multiple measurement systems with components of the same make and model numbers, you need only perform this interference check on one system and you may also rely on an interference test conducted by the manufacturer on a system having components of the same make and model(s) of the system that you use. The interference test procedure is found in section 8.6 of this method.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Calibration Gas Verification. How must I verify the concentrations of my calibration gases?</P>
            <P>8.2.2.1 Cylinder Gas Standards. When cylinder gas standards are used for Hg<SU>0</SU>, obtain a certificate from the gas manufacturer and confirm that the documentation includes all information required by an EPA traceability protocol (see section 16). Confirm that the manufacturer certification is complete and current. Ensure that the calibration gas certifications have not expired.</P>

            <P>8.2.2.2 Other Calibration Standards. All other calibration standards for HgCl<E T="52">2</E> and Hg<SU>0</SU>, such as gas generators, must meet the requirements of an EPA traceability protocol (see section 16), and the certification procedures must be fully documented in the test report.</P>
            <P>8.2.2.3 Calibration Span. Select the calibration span (i.e., high-level gas concentration) so that the measured source emissions are 10 to 100 percent of the calibration span. This requirement is waived for applications in which the Hg concentrations are consistently below 1 µg/m<SU>3</SU>; however, the calibration span for these low-concentration applications shall not exceed 5 µg/m<SU>3</SU>.</P>

            <P>8.2.3 Measurement System Preparation. How do I prepare my measurement system for use? Assemble, prepare, and precondition the measurement system according to your standard operating procedure. Adjust the system to achieve the correct sampling rate or dilution ratio (as applicable). Then, conduct a 3-point system calibration error test using Hg<SU>0</SU> as described in section 8.2.4, an initial system integrity check using HgCl<E T="52">2</E> and a zero gas as described in section 8.2.5, and a pre-test dynamic spiking test as described in section 8.2.7.</P>

            <P>8.2.4 System Calibration Error Test. Conduct a 3-point system calibration error test before the first test run. Use Hg<SU>0</SU> standards for this test. Introduce the low-, mid-, and high-level calibration gases in any order, in system calibration mode, unless you desire to determine the system response time during this test, in which case, inject the gases such that the high-level injection directly follows the low-level injection. For non-dilution systems, you may adjust the system to maintain the correct flow rate at the analyzer during the test, but you may not make adjustments for any other purpose. For dilution systems, you must operate the measurement system at the appropriate dilution <PRTPAGE P="647"/>ratio during all system calibration error checks, and you may make only the adjustments necessary to maintain the proper ratio. After each gas injection, wait until a stable response has been obtained. Record the analyzer's final, stable response to each calibration gas on a form similar to Table 30A-1 in section 17.0. For each calibration gas, calculate the system calibration error using Equation 30A-1 in section 12.2. The calibration error specification in section 13.1 must be met for the low-, mid-, and high-level gases. If the calibration error specification is not met for all three gases, take corrective action and repeat the test until an acceptable 3-point calibration is achieved.</P>

            <P>8.2.5 System Integrity Check. Perform a two-point system integrity check before the first test run. Use the zero gas and either the mid- or high-level HgCl<E T="52">2</E> calibration gas for the check, whichever one best represents the total vapor phase Hg concentration levels in the stack. Record the data on a form similar to Table 30A-2 in section 17.0. The system integrity check specification in section 13.2 must be met for both the zero gas and the mid- or high-level gas. If the system integrity specification is not met for both gases, take corrective action and repeat the test until an acceptable system integrity check is achieved.</P>
            <P>8.2.6 Measurement System Response Time. The measurement system response time is used to determine the minimum sampling time for each sampling point and is equal to the time that is required for the measured Hg concentration to increase from the stable low-level calibration gas response to a value within 5 percent of the stable high-level calibration gas response during the system calibration error test in section 8.2.4. Round off the measured system response time to the nearest minute.</P>
            <P>8.2.7 Dynamic Spiking Test. You must perform dynamic spiking prior to the first test run to validate your test data. The purpose of this procedure is to demonstrate that the site-specific flue gas matrix does not adversely affect the accuracy of the measurement system. The specifications in section 13.5 must be met to validate your data. If these specifications are not met for the pre-test dynamic spiking, you may not proceed with the test until satisfactory results are obtained. For the time period between the effective date of this method and January 1, 2009, the dynamic spiking requirement is waived.</P>
            <P>8.2.7.1 How do I perform dynamic spiking? Dynamic spiking is a gas phase application of the method of standard additions, which involves injecting a known quantity of Hg into the measurement system upstream of all sample conditioning components, similar to system calibration mode, except the probe is not flooded and the resulting sample stream includes both effluent gas and the spike gas. You must follow a written procedure that details how the spike is added to the system, how the spike dilution factor (DF) is measured, and how the Hg concentration data are collected and processed.</P>
            <P>8.2.7.2 Spiking Procedure Requirements.</P>

            <P>8.2.7.2.1 Spiking Gas Requirements. The spike gas must also be a HgCl<E T="52">2</E> calibration gas certified by an EPA traceability protocol. You must choose concentrations that can produce the target levels while being injected at a volumetric flow rate that is ≤20 percent of the total volumetric flow rate through the measurement system (i.e., sample flow rate plus spike gas flow rate).</P>

            <P>8.2.7.2.2 Target Spiking Level. The target level for spiking must be 150 to 200 percent of the native Hg concentration; however, if the native Hg concentration is &lt;1 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, set the target level to add between 1 and 4 µg/m<SU>3</SU> Hg<E T="51">+2</E> to the native concentration. Use Equation 30A-5 in section 12.5 to calculate the acceptable range of spike gas concentrations at the target level. Then select a spike gas concentration in that range.</P>
            <P>8.2.7.2.3 Spike Injections. You must inject spikes in such a manner that the spiking does not alter the total volumetric sample system flow rate and dilution ratio (if applicable). You must collect at least 3 data points, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) specification in section 13.5 must be met. Each data point represents a single spike injection, and pre- and post-injection measurements of the native Hg concentration (or diluted native concentration, as applicable) are required for each spike injection.</P>
            <P>8.2.7.2.4 Spike Dilution Factor (DF). For each spike injection, DF, the dilution factor must be determined. DF is the ratio of the total volumetric flow rate of gas through the measurement system to the spike gas flow rate. This factor must be ≥5. The spiking mass balance calculation is directly dependent on the accuracy of the DF determination. As a result, high accuracy total volumetric flow rate and spike gas flowrate measurements are required. These flow rates may be determined by direct or indirect measurement. Calibrated flow meters, venturies, orifices or tracer gas measurements are examples of potential flow measurement techniques.</P>

            <P>8.2.7.2.5 Concentrations. The measurement system must record total vapor phase Hg concentrations continuously during the dynamic spiking procedure. It is possible that dynamic spiking at a level close to 200 percent of the native Hg concentration may cause the measured Hg concentration to exceed the calibration span value. Avoid this by choosing a lower spiking level or by recalibration at a higher span. The measurements shall not exceed 120 percent of the calibration span. The “baseline” measurements made between spikes may represent <PRTPAGE P="648"/>the native Hg concentration (if spike gas flow is stopped between injections) or the native Hg concentration diluted by blank or carrier gas flowing at the same rate as the spike gas (if gas flow cannot be stopped between injections). Each baseline measurement must include at least 4 readings or 1 minute (whichever is greater) of stable responses. Use Equation 30A-10 or 30A-11 in section 12.10 (as applicable) to convert baseline measurements to native concentration.</P>
            <P>8.2.7.2.6 Recovery. Calculate spike recoveries using Equation 30A-7 in section 12.7. Mass recoveries may be calculated from stable responses based on injected mass flows or from integrated response peaks based on total mass injected. Calculate the mean and RSD for the three (or more) spike injections and compare to the specifications in section 13.5.</P>

            <P>8.2.7.2.7 Error Adjustment Option. You may adjust the measurement data collected during dynamic spiking for the system calibration error using Equation 30A-3 in section 12. To do this, perform the initial system integrity check prior to the dynamic spiking test, and perform another system integrity check following the dynamic spiking test and before the first test run. If you choose this option, you must apply Equation 30A-3 to both the spiked sample concentration measurement (C<E T="52">ss</E>) and the baseline or native concentration measurement (C<E T="52">native</E>), each substituted in place of C<E T="52">avg</E> in the equation.</P>
            <P>8.2.7.3 Example Spiking Procedure Using a Hot Vapor Calibration Source Generator.</P>

            <P>(a) Introduce the spike gas into the probe using a hot vapor calibration source generator and a solution of HgCl<E T="52">2</E> in dilute HC1 and HNO<E T="52">3</E>. The calibrator uses a mass flow controller (accurate within 2 percent) to measure the gas flow, and the solution feed is measured using a top-loading balance accurate to 0.01g. The challenges of injecting oxidized Hg may make it impractical to stop the flow of gas between spike injections. In this case, operate the hot vapor calibration source generator continuously during the spiking procedure, swapping blank solutions for HgCl<E T="52">2</E> solutions when switching between spiking and baseline measurements.</P>
            <P>(b) If applicable, monitor the measurement system to make sure the total sampling system flow rate and the sample dilution ratio do not change during this procedure. Record all data on a data sheet similar to Table 30A-5 in section 17.0. If the Hg measurement system design makes it impractical to measure the total volumetric flow rate through the system, use a spike gas that includes a tracer for measuring the dilution factor, DF (see Equation 30A-9 in section 12.9). Allow the measurements to stabilize between each spike injection, average the pre- and post-injection baseline measurements, and calculate the native concentration. If this measurement shifts by more than 5 percent during any injection, it may be necessary to discard that data point and repeat the injection to achieve the required RSD among the injections. If the spikes persistently show poor repeatability, or if the recoveries are not within the range specified in section 13.5, take corrective action.</P>
            <P>8.2.8 Run Validation. How do I confirm that each run I conduct is valid?</P>
            <P>8.2.8.1 System Integrity Checks.</P>
            <P>(a) Before and after each test run, perform a two-point system integrity check using the same procedure as the initial system integrity check described in section 8.2.5. You may use data from that initial system integrity check as the pre-run data for the first test run, provided it is the most recent system integrity check done before the first run. You may also use the results of a successful post-run system integrity check as the pre-run data for the next test run. Do not make any adjustments to the measurement system during these checks, other than to maintain the target calibration gas flow rate and the proper dilution ratio.</P>
            <P>(b) As a time-saving alternative, you may, at the risk of invalidating multiple test runs, skip one or more integrity checks during a test day. Provided there have been no auto-calibrations or other instrument alterations, a single integrity check may suffice as a post-run check to validate (or invalidate) as many consecutive test runs as can be completed during a single test day. All subsequent test days must begin with a pre-run system integrity check subject to the same performance criteria and corrective action requirements as a post-run system integrity check.</P>
            <P>(c) Each system integrity check must meet the criteria for system integrity checks in section 13.2. If a post-run system integrity check is failed, all test runs since the last passed system integrity check are invalid. If a post-run or a pre-run system integrity check is failed, you must take corrective action and pass another 3-point Hg<SU>0</SU> system calibration error test (Section 8.2.4) followed by another system integrity check before conducting any additional test runs. Record the results of the pre- and post-run system integrity checks on a form similar to Table 30A-2 in section 17.0.</P>
            <P>8.2.8.2 Drift Check. Using the data from the successful pre- and post-run system integrity checks, calculate the zero and upscale drift, using Equation 30A-2 in section 12.3. Exceeding the section 13.3 specification does not invalidate the run, but corrective action must be taken and a new 3-point Hg<SU>0</SU> system calibration error test and a system integrity check must be passed before any more runs are made.</P>

            <P>8.3 Dilution-Type Systems—Special Considerations. When a dilution-type measurement system is used, there are three important considerations that must be taken into <PRTPAGE P="649"/>account to ensure the quality of the emissions data. First, the critical orifice size and dilution ratio must be selected properly so that the sample dew point will be below the sample line and analyzer temperatures. Second, a high-quality, accurate dilution controller must be used to maintain the correct dilution ratio during sampling. The dilution controller should be capable of monitoring the dilution air pressure, orifice upstream pressure, eductor vacuum, and sample flow rates. Third, differences between the molecular weight of calibration gas mixtures, dilution air, and the stack gas molecular weight must be considered because these can affect the dilution ratio and introduce measurement bias.</P>
            <P>8.4 Sampling.</P>
            <P>(a) Position the probe at the first sampling point. Allow the system to flush and equilibrate for at least two times the measurement system response time before recording any data. Then, traverse and record measurements at all required sampling points. Sample at each traverse point for an equal length of time, maintaining the appropriate sample flow rate or dilution ratio (as applicable). For all Hg instrumental method systems, the minimum sampling time at each sampling point must be at least two times the system response time, but not less than 10 minutes. For concentrating systems, the minimum sampling time must also include at least 4 concentration measurement cycles.</P>
            <P>(b) After recording data for the appropriate period of time at the first traverse point, you may move the sample probe to the next point and continue recording, omitting the requirement to allow the system to equilibrate for two times the system response time before recording data at the subsequent traverse points. You must, however, sample at this and all subsequent traverse points for the required minimum amount of time specified in this section. If you must remove the probe from the stack for any reason, you must again allow the sampling system to equilibrate for at least two times the system response time prior to resuming data recording.</P>
            <P>(c) If at any point the measured Hg concentration exceeds the calibration span value, you must at a minimum identify and report this as a deviation from the method. Depending on the data quality objectives of the test, this event may require corrective action before proceeding. If the average Hg concentration for any run exceeds the calibration span value, the run is invalidated.</P>
            <P>8.5 Moisture Correction. If the moisture basis (wet or dry) of the measurements made with this method is different from the moisture basis of either: (1) The applicable emission limit; or (2) a Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system being evaluated for relative accuracy, you must determine the moisture content of the flue gas and correct the measured gas concentrations to a dry basis using Method 4 in appendix A-3 of this part or other appropriate methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>
            <P>8.6 Optional Interference Test Procedure.</P>
            <P>(a) Select an appropriate calibration span that reflects the source(s) to be tested and perform the interference check at 40 percent of the lowest calibration span value anticipated, e.g., 10 µg/m<SU>3</SU>. Alternatively, successfully conducting the interference test at an absolute Hg concentration of 2 µg/m<SU>3</SU> will demonstrate performance for an equivalent calibration span of 5 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, the lowest calibration span allowed for Method 30A testing. Therefore, performing the interference test at the 2 µ/m<SU>3</SU> level will serve to demonstrate acceptable performance for all calibration spans greater than or equal to 5 µg/m<SU>3</SU>.</P>
            <P>(b) Introduce the interference test gases listed in Table 30A-3 in section 17.0 into the measurement system separately or as a mixture. The interference test gases HCl and NO must be introduced as a mixture. The interference test gases must be introduced into the sampling system at the probe such that the interference gas mixtures pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other components as would be configured for normal sampling.</P>
            <P>(c) The interference test must be performed using HgCl<E T="52">2</E>, and each interference test gas (or gas mixture) must be evaluated in triplicate. This is accomplished by measuring the Hg response first with only the HgCl<E T="52">2</E> gas present and then when adding the interference test gas(es) while maintaining the HgCl<E T="52">2</E> concentration of the test stream constant. It is important that the equipment used to conduct the interference test be of sufficient quality so as to be capable of blending the HgCl<E T="52">2</E> and interference gases while maintaining the Hg concentration constant. Gas blending system or manifolds may be used.</P>
            <P>(d) The duration of each test should be for a sufficient period of time to ensure the Hg measurement system surfaces are conditioned and a stable output is obtained. Measure the Hg response of the analyzer to these gases in µg/m3. Record the responses and determine the overall interference response using Table 30A-4 in section 17.0 and the equations presented in section 12.11. The specification in section 13.4 must be met.</P>

            <P>(e) A copy of these data, including the date completed and a signed certification, must be included with each test report. The intent of this test is that the interference test results are intended to be valid for the life of the system. As a result, the Hg measurement system should be operated and tested in a configuration consistent with the configuration that will be used for field applications. However, if the system used for field testing is not consistent with the system that was interference-tested, the interference test <PRTPAGE P="650"/>must be repeated before it is used for any field applications. Examples of such conditions include, but are not limited to: major changes in dilution ratio (for dilution based systems), changes in catalyst materials, changes in filtering device design or materials, changes in probe design or configuration, and changes in gas conditioning materials or approaches.</P>

            <P>Your analyzer must be calibrated with Hg° standards. The initial 3-point system calibration error test described in section 8.2.4 is required before you start the test. Also, prior to and following test runs, the two-point system integrity checks described in sections 8.2.5 and 8.2.8 are required. On and after January 1, 2009, the pre-test dynamic spiking procedure described in section 8.2.7 is also required to verify that the accuracy of the measurement system is suitable and not adversely affected by the flue gas matrix.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">What is Method 30B?</HD>
            <P>Method 30B is a procedure for measuring total vapor phase mercury (Hg) emissions from coal-fired combustion sources using sorbent trap sampling and an extractive or thermal analytical technique. This method is only intended for use only under relatively low particulate conditions (e.g., sampling after all pollution control devices). Quality assurance and quality control requirements are included to assure that you, the tester, collect data of known and acceptable quality for each testing program. This method does not completely describe all equipment, supplies, and sampling and analytical procedures you will need, but instead refers to other test methods for some of the details. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, you should also have a thorough knowledge of these additional methods which are found in Appendices A-1 and A-3 to this part:</P>

            <P>1.1 Analytes. What does this method determine? This method is designed to measure the mass concentration of total vapor phase Hg in flue gas, including elemental Hg (Hg<SU>0</SU>) and oxidized forms of Hg (Hg<E T="51">+2</E>), in micrograms per dry standard cubic meter (µg/dscm).</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability. When is this method required? Method 30B is a reference method for relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) of vapor phase Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems installed at coal-fired boilers and is also appropriate for Hg emissions testing at such boilers. It is intended for use only under relatively low particulate conditions (i.e., sampling after all pollution control devices); in cases where significant amounts of particle-bound Hg may be present, an isokinetic sampling method for Hg should be used. Method 30B may also be specified by New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), emissions trading programs, State Implementation Plans (SIPs), and operating permits that require measurement of Hg concentrations in stationary source emissions, either to determine compliance with an applicable emission standard or limit, or to conduct RATAs of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems.</P>
            <P>1.3 Data Quality Objectives (DQO). How good must my collected data be? Method 30B has been designed to provide data of high and known quality for Hg emissions testing and for RATA testing of Hg monitoring systems, including CEMS and sorbent trap monitors. In these and other applications, the principal objective is to ensure the accuracy of the data at the actual emissions levels and in the actual emissions matrix encountered. To meet this objective, NIST-traceable calibration standards must be used and method performance tests are required.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Method</HD>
            <P>Known volumes of flue gas are extracted from a stack or duct through paired, in-stack sorbent media traps at an appropriate flow rate. Collection of mercury on the sorbent media in the stack mitigates potential loss of mercury during transport through a probe/sample line. For each test run, paired train sampling is required to determine measurement precision and verify acceptability of the measured emissions data. A field recovery test which assesses recovery of an elemental Hg spike to determine measurement bias is also used to verify data acceptability. The sorbent traps are recovered from the sampling system, prepared for analysis as needed, and analyzed by any suitable determinative technique that can meet the performance criteria.</P>

Any chemical should be regarded as a potential health hazard and exposure to these compounds should be minimized. Chemists should refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical used.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>The following list is presented as an example of key equipment and supplies likely required to measure vapor-phase Hg using a sorbent trap sampling system. It is recognized that additional equipment and supplies may be needed. Collection of paired samples is required.</P>
            <P>6.1 Sorbent Trap Sampling System. A typical sorbent trap sampling system is shown in Figure 30B-1 in section 17.0. The sorbent trap sampling system shall include the following components:</P>

            <P>6.1.1 Sorbent Traps. The sorbent media used to collect Hg must be configured in a trap with at least two distinct segments or sections, connected in series, that are amenable to separate analyses. section 1 is designated for primary capture of gaseous Hg. section 2 is designated as a backup section for determination of vapor phase Hg breakthrough. Each sorbent trap must be inscribed or otherwise permanently marked with a unique identification number, for tracking purposes. The sorbent media may be any collection material (e.g., carbon, chemically-treated filter, etc.) capable of quantitatively capturing and recovering for subsequent analysis, all gaseous forms of Hg in the emissions from the intended application. Selection of the sorbent media shall be based on the material's ability to achieve the performance criteria contained in this method as well as the sorbent's vapor phase <PRTPAGE P="665"/>Hg capture efficiency for the emissions matrix and the expected sampling duration at the test site. The sorbent media must be obtained from a source that can demonstrate their quality assurance and quality control (see section 7.2). The paired sorbent traps are supported on a probe (or probes) and inserted directly into the flue gas stream.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Sampling Probe Assembly. Each probe assembly shall have a leak-free attachment to the sorbent trap(s). Each sorbent trap must be mounted at the entrance of or within the probe such that the gas sampled enters the trap directly. Each probe/sorbent trap assembly must be heated to a temperature sufficient to prevent liquid condensation in the sorbent trap(s). Auxiliary heating is required only where the stack temperature is too low to prevent condensation. Use a calibrated thermocouple to monitor the stack temperature. A single probe capable of operating the paired sorbent traps may be used. Alternatively, individual probe/sorbent trap assemblies may be used, provided that the individual sorbent traps are co-located to ensure representative Hg monitoring.</P>
            <P>6.1.3 Moisture Removal Device. A moisture removal device or system shall be used to remove water vapor from the gas stream prior to entering dry gas flow metering devices.</P>
            <P>6.1.4 Vacuum Pump. Use a leak-tight, vacuum pump capable of operating within the system's flow range.</P>
            <P>6.1.5 Gas Flow Meter. A gas flow meter (such as a dry gas meter, thermal mass flow meter, or other suitable measurement device) shall be used to determine the total sample volume on a dry basis, in units of standard cubic meters. The meter must be sufficiently accurate to measure the total sample volume to within 2 percent and must be calibrated at selected flow rates across the range of sample flow rates at which the sampling train will be operated. The gas flow meter shall be equipped with any necessary auxiliary measurement devices (e.g., temperature sensors, pressure measurement devices) needed to correct the sample volume to standard conditions.</P>
            <P>6.1.6 Sample Flow Rate Meter and Controller. Use a flow rate indicator and controller for maintaining necessary sampling flow rates.</P>
            <P>6.1.7 Temperature Sensor. Same as section 6.1.1.7 of Method 5 in Appendix A-3 to this part.</P>
            <P>6.1.8 Barometer. Same as section 6.1.2 of Method 5 in Appendix A-3 to this part.</P>
            <P>6.1.9 Data Logger (optional). Device for recording associated and necessary ancillary information (e.g., temperatures, pressures, flow, time, etc.).</P>

            <P>6.2 Gaseous Hg<SU>0</SU> Sorbent Trap Spiking System. A known mass of gaseous Hg<SU>0</SU> must be either present on or spiked onto the first section of sorbent traps in order to perform the Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> analytical bias test and the field recovery study. Any approach capable of quantitatively delivering known masses of Hg<SU>0</SU> onto sorbent traps is acceptable. Several spiking technologies or devices are available to meet this objective. Their practicality is a function of Hg mass spike levels. For low levels, NIST-certified or NIST-traceable gas generators or tanks may be suitable. An alternative system, capable of delivering almost any mass required, makes use of NIST-certified or NIST-traceable Hg salt solutions (e.g., HgCl<E T="52">2</E>, Hg(NO<E T="52">3</E>)<E T="52">2</E>). With this system, an aliquot of known volume and concentration is added to a reaction vessel containing a reducing agent (e.g., stannous chloride); the Hg salt solution is reduced to Hg<SU>0</SU> and purged onto the sorbent trap using an impinger sparging system. When available, information on example spiking systems will be posted at <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.</E>
            </P>
            <P>6.3 Sample Analysis Equipment. Any analytical system capable of quantitatively recovering and quantifying total Hg from the sorbent media selected is acceptable provided that the analysis can meet the performance criteria described in this method. Example recovery techniques include acid leaching, digestion, and thermal desorption/direct combustion.

            <P>8.2.1 Analytical Matrix Interference Test and Minimum Sample Dilution.</P>
            <P>(a) The analytical matrix interference test is a laboratory procedure. It is required only if you elect to use a liquid digestion analytical approach and needs to be performed only once for each sorbent material used. The purpose of the test is to verify the presence or absence of known and potential analytical matrix interferences, including the potential negative bias associated with iodine common to many sorbent trap materials. The analytical matrix interference test determines the minimum dilution (if any) necessary to mitigate matrix effects on the sample digestate solutions.</P>

            <P>(b) The result of the analytical matrix interference test, i.e., the minimum sample dilution required (if any) for all sample analyses, is used to establish the minimum sample mass needed for the Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> analytical bias test and to determine the nominal sample volume for a test run. The analytical matrix interference test is sorbent material-specific and shall be performed for each sorbent material you intend to use for field sampling and analysis. The test shall be performed using a mass of sorbent material comparable to the sorbent mass typically used in the first section of the trap for sampling. Similar sorbent materials from different sources of supply are considered to be different materials and must be tested individually. You must conduct the analytical matrix interference test for each sorbent material prior to the analysis of field samples.</P>

            <P>8.2.1.1 Analytical Matrix Interference Test Procedures. Digest and prepare for analysis a representative mass of sorbent material (unsampled) according to your intended laboratory techniques for field samples. Analyze the digestate according to your intended analytical conditions at the least diluted level you intend to use for sample analysis (e.g., undiluted, 1 in 10 dilution, etc.). Determine the Hg concentration of the undiluted digestate solution. Prepare a series of solutions with a fixed final volume containing graduated aliquots of the sample digestate and, a fixed aliquot of a calibration standard (with the balance being Hg-free reagent or H<E T="52">2</E>0) to establish solutions of varied digestate dilution ratio (e.g., 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:100, etc.—see example in section 8.2.1.3, below). One of these solutions should contain only the aliquot of the calibration standard in Hg-free reagent or H<E T="52">2</E>O. This will result in a series of solutions where the amount of Hg is held relatively constant and only the volume of digestate diluted is varied. Analyze each of these solutions following intended sample analytical procedures and conditions, determining the concentration for each solution.</P>
            <P>8.2.1.2 Analytical Matrix Interference Test Acceptance Criteria. Compare the measured concentration of each solution containing digestate to the measured concentration of the digestate-free solution. The lowest dilution ratio of any solution having a Hg concentration within ±5 percent of the digestate-free solution is the minimum dilution ratio required for analysis of all samples. If you desire to measure the digestate without dilution, the ±5 percent criterion must be met at a dilution ratio of at least 9:10 (i.e., ≥90% digestate).</P>

            <P>8.2.1.3 Example Analytical Matrix Interference Test. An example analytical matrix interference test is presented below. Additional information on the conduct of the analytical matrix interference test will be posted at <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.</E> Determine the most sensitive working range for the analyzer to be used. This will be a narrow range of concentrations. Digest and prepare for analysis a representative mass of sorbent material (unsampled) according to your intended laboratory techniques for sample preparation and analysis. Prepare a calibration curve for the most sensitive analytical region, e.g., 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10 ppb. Using the highest calibration standard, e.g., 10.0 ppb, prepare a series of solutions by adding successively smaller increments of the digestate to a fixed volume of the calibration standard and bringing each solution to a final fixed volume with mercury-free deionized water (diH<E T="52">2</E>O). To 2.0 ml of the calibration standard add 18.0, 10.0, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.2, and 0.0 ml of the digestate. Bring the final volume of each solution to a total volume of <PRTPAGE P="667"/>20 ml by adding 0.0, 8.0, 14.0, 16.0, 17.0, 17.8, and 18.0 ml of diH<E T="52">2</E>O. This will yield solutions with dilution ratios of 9:10, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:100, and 0:10, respectively. Determine the Hg concentration of each solution. The dilution ratio of any solution having a concentration that is within ±5 percent of the concentration of the solution containing 0.0 ml of digestate is an acceptable dilution ratio for analyzing field samples. If more than one solution meets this criterion, the one with the lowest dilution ratio is the minimum dilution required for analysis of field samples. If the 9:10 dilution meets this criterion, then no sample dilution is required.</P>

            <P>8.2.2 Determination of Minimum Sample Mass. The minimum mass of Hg that must be collected per sample must be determined. This information is necessary in order to effectively perform the Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> Analytical Bias Test, to estimate target sample volumes/sample times for test runs, and to ensure the quality of the measurements. The determination of minimum sample mass is a direct function of analytical technique, measurement sensitivity, dilutions, etc. This determination is required for all analytical techniques. Based on the analytical approach you employ, you should determine the most sensitive calibration range. Based on a calibration point within that range, you must consider all sample treatments (e.g., dilutions) to determine the mass of sample that needs to be collected to ensure that all sample analyses fall within your calibration curve.</P>

            <P>8.2.2.1 Determination of Minimum Calibration Concentration or Mass. Based on your instrument's sensitivity and linearity, determine the calibration concentrations or masses that make up a representative low level calibration range. Verify that you are able to meet the multipoint calibration performance criteria in section 11.0 of this method. Select a calibration concentration or mass that is no less than 2 times the lowest concentration or mass in your calibration curve. The lowest point in your calibration curve must be at least 5, and preferably 10, times the Method Detection Limit (MDL), which is the minimum amount of the analyte that can be detected and reported. The MDL must be determined at least once for the analytical system using an MDL study such as that found in section 15.0 to Method 301 of appendix A to part 63 of this chapter.

            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note to section 8.2.2.1:</HD>
              <P>While it might be desirable to base the minimum calibration concentration or mass on the lowest point in the calibration curve, selecting a higher concentration or mass is necessary to ensure that all analyses of the field samples will fall within the calibration curve. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you select a minimum calibration concentration or mass that is sufficiently above the lowest point of the calibration curve (see examples in sections 8.2.2.2.1 and 8.2.2.2.2 below).</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.2.2.2 Determination of Minimum Sample Mass. Based on your minimum calibration concentration or mass and other sample treatments including, but not limited to, final digestate volume and minimum sample dilution, determine the minimum sample mass. Consideration should also be given to the Hg levels expected to be measured in section 2 of the sorbent traps and to the breakthrough criteria presented in Table 9-1.</P>

            <P>8.2.2.2.1 Example Determination of Minimum Sample Mass for Thermal Desorption Analysis. A thermal analysis system has been calibrated at five Hg mass levels: 10 ng, 20 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, 200 ng, and shown to meet the calibration performance criteria in this method. Based on 2 times the lowest point in the calibration curve, 20 ng is selected as the minimum calibration mass. Because the entire sample is analyzed and there are no dilutions involved, the minimum sample mass is also 20 ng.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>In this example, if the typical background (blank) Hg levels in section 2 were relatively high (e.g., 3 to 5 ng), a sample mass of 20 ng might not have been sufficient to ensure that the breakthrough criteria in Table 9-1 would be met, thereby necessitating the use of a higher point on the calibration curve (e.g., 50 ng) as the minimum calibration and sample mass.</P>

            <P>8.2.2.2.2 Example Determination of Minimum Sample Mass for Acid Leachate/Digestate Analysis. A cold vapor analysis system has been calibrated at four Hg concentration levels: 2 ng/L, 5 ng, 10 ng/L, 20 ng/L, and shown to meet the calibration performance criteria in this method. Based on 2 times the lowest point in the calibration curve, 4 ng/L was selected as the minimum calibration concentration. The final sample volume of a digestate is nominally 50 ml (0.05 L) and the minimum dilution necessary was determined to be 1:100 by the Analytical Matrix Interference Test of section 8.2.1. The following calculation would be used to determine the minimum sample mass.

              <P>In this example, if the typical background (blank) Hg levels in section 2 were relatively high (e.g., 3 to 5 ng), a sample mass of 20 ng might not have been sufficient to ensure that the breakthrough criterion in Table 9-1 would be met, thereby necessitating the use of a higher point on the calibration curve (e.g., 10 ng/L) as the minimum calibration concentration.</P>

            <P>8.2.3 Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> Analytical Bias Test. Before analyzing any field samples, the laboratory must demonstrate the ability to recover and accurately quantify Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="668"/>from the chosen sorbent media by performing the following analytical bias test for sorbent traps spiked with Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E>. The analytical bias test is performed at a minimum of two distinct sorbent trap Hg loadings that will: (1) Represent the lower and upper bound of sample Hg loadings for application of the analytical technique to the field samples, and (2) be used for data validation.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1 Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> Analytical Bias Test Procedures. Determine the lower and upper bound mass loadings. The minimum sample mass established in section 8.2.2.2 can be used for the lower bound Hg mass loading although lower Hg loading levels are acceptable. The upper bound Hg loading level should be an estimate of the greatest mass loading that may result as a function of stack concentration and volume sampled. As previously noted, this test defines the bounds that actual field samples must be within in order to be valid.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1.1 Hg<SU>0</SU> Analytical Bias Test. Analyze the front section of three sorbent traps containing Hg<SU>0</SU> at the lower bound mass loading level and the front section of three sorbent traps containing Hg<SU>0</SU> at the upper bound mass loading level. In other words, analyze each mass loading level in triplicate. You may refer to section 6.2 for spiking guidance. Prepare and analyze each spiked trap, using the same techniques that will be used to prepare and analyze the field samples. The average recovery for the three traps at each mass loading level must be between 90 and 110 percent. If multiple types of sorbent media are to be analyzed, a separate analytical bias test is required for each sorbent material.</P>
            <P>8.2.3.1.2 HgCl<E T="52">2</E> Analytical Bias Test. Analyze the front section of three sorbent traps containing HgCl<E T="52">2</E> at the lower bound mass loading level and the front section of three traps containing HgCl<E T="52">2</E> at the upper bound mass loading level. HgCl<E T="52">2</E> can be spiked as a gas, or as a liquid solution containing HgCl<E T="52">2</E>. However the liquid volume spiked must be &lt;100 µL. Prepare and analyze each spiked trap, using the techniques that will be used to prepare and analyze the field samples. The average recovery for three traps at each spike concentration must be between 90 and 110 percent. Again, if multiple types of sorbent media are to be analyzed, a separate analytical bias test is required for each sorbent material.</P>

            <P>8.2.4 Determination of Target Sample Volume. The target sample volume is an estimate of the sample volume needed to ensure that valid emissions data are collected (i.e., that sample mass Hg loadings fall within the analytical calibration curve and are within the upper and lower bounds set by the analytical bias tests). The target sample volume and minimum sample mass can also be determined by performing a diagnostic test run prior to initiation of formal testing.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>

              <P>If the minimum sample mass is 50 ng and the concentration of mercury in the stack gas is estimated to be 2 µg/m<SU>3</SU> (ng/L) then the following calculation would be used to determine the target sample volume:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Target Sample Volume = (50 ng) / (2 ng/L) = 25 L</FP>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note to section 8.2.4:</HD>
              <P>For the purposes of relative accuracy testing of Hg monitoring systems under subpart UUUUU of part 63 of this chapter and Performance Specifications 12A and 12B in appendix B to this part, when the stack gas Hg concentration is expected to be very low (&lt;0.5 µg/dscm), you may estimate the Hg concentration at 0.5 µg/dscm.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>8.2.5 Determination of Sample Run Time. Sample run time will be a function of minimum sample mass (see section 8.2.2), target sample volume and nominal equipment sample flow rate. The minimum sample run time for conducting relative accuracy test audits of Hg monitoring systems is 30 minutes and for emissions testing to characterize an emission source is 1 hour. The target sample run time can be calculated using the following example.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>

              <P>If the target sample volume has been determined to be 25 L, then the following formula would be used to determine the sampling time necessary to acquire 25 L of gas when sampling at a rate of 0.4 L/min.
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Sampling time (min) = 25 L / 0.4 L/min = 63 minutes</FP>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <P>8.2.6 Field Recovery Test. The field recovery test provides a test program-specific verification of the performance of the combined sampling and analytical approach. Three sets of paired samples, one of each pair which is spiked with a known level of Hg, are collected and analyzed and the average recovery of the spiked samples is used to verify performance of the measurement system under field conditions during that test program. The conduct of this test requires an estimate or confirmation of the stack Hg concentrations at the time of testing.</P>

            <P>8.2.6.1 Calculation of Pre-sampling Spiking Level. Determine the sorbent trap spiking level for the field recovery test using estimates of the stack Hg concentration, the target sample flow rate, and the planned sample duration. First, determine the Hg mass expected to be collected in section 1 of the sorbent trap. The pre-sampling spike must be within 50 to 150 percent of this expected mass.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example calculation:</HD>

              <P>For an expected stack Hg concentration of 5 ug/m<SU>3</SU> (ng/L) a target sample rate of 0.40 liters/min, and a sample duration of 1 hour:

            <P>A Hg spike of 60 to 180 ng (50-150% of 120 ng) would be appropriate.</P>

            <P>8.2.6.2 Procedures. Set up two identical sampling trains. One of the sampling trains <PRTPAGE P="669"/>shall be designated the spiked train and the other the unspiked train. Spike Hg<SU>0</SU> onto the front section of the sorbent trap in the spiked train before sampling. The mass of Hg spiked shall be 50 to 150 percent of the mass expected to be collected with the unspiked train. Sample the stack gas with the two trains simultaneously using the same procedures as for the field samples (see section 8.3). The total sample volume must be within ±20 percent of the target sample volume for the field sample test runs. Analyze the sorbent traps from the two trains utilizing the same analytical procedures and instrumentation as for the field samples (see section 11.0). Determine the fraction of spiked Hg recovered (R) using the equations in section 12.7. Repeat this procedure for a total of three runs. Report the individual R values in the test report; the average of the three R values must be between 85 and 115 percent.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note to section 8.2.6.2:</HD>
              <P>It is acceptable to perform the field recovery test concurrent with actual test runs (e.g., through the use of a quad probe). It is also acceptable to use the field recovery test runs as test runs for emissions testing or for the RATA of a Hg monitoring system under subpart UUUUU of part 63 of this chapter and Performance Specifications 12A and 12B in appendix B to this part, if certain conditions are met. To determine whether a particular field recovery test run may be used as a RATA run, subtract the mass of the Hg<SU>0</SU> spike from the total Hg mass collected in sections 1 and 2 of the spiked trap. The difference represents the mass of Hg in the stack gas sample. Divide this mass by the sample volume to obtain the Hg concentration in the effluent gas stream, as measured with the spiked trap. Compare this concentration to the corresponding Hg concentration measured with the unspiked trap. If the paired trains meet the relative deviation and other applicable data validation criteria in Table 9-1, then the average of the two Hg concentrations may be used as an emissions test run value or as the reference method value for a RATA run.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.3 Sampling. This section describes the procedures and criteria for collecting the field samples for analysis. As noted in section 8.2.6, the field recovery test samples are also collected using these procedures.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Pre-test leak check. Perform a leak check of the sampling system with the sorbent traps in place. For each of the paired sampling trains, draw a vacuum in the train, and adjust the vacuum to ~15″ Hg; and, using the gas flow meter, determine leak rate. The leak rate for an individual train must not exceed 4 percent of the target sampling rate. Once the leak check passes this criterion, carefully release the vacuum in the sample train, then seal the sorbent trap inlet until the probe is ready for insertion into the stack or duct.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Determination of Flue Gas Characteristics. Determine or measure the flue gas measurement environment characteristics (gas temperature, static pressure, gas velocity, stack moisture, etc.) in order to determine ancillary requirements such as probe heating requirements (if any), initial sampling rate, moisture management, etc.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 Sample Collection</P>
            <P>8.3.3.1 Remove the plug from the end of each sorbent trap and store each plug in a clean sorbent trap storage container. Remove the stack or duct port cap and insert the probe(s). Secure the probe(s) and ensure that no leakage occurs between the duct and environment.</P>
            <P>8.3.3.2 Record initial data including the sorbent trap ID, date, and the run start time.</P>
            <P>8.3.3.3 Record the initial gas flow meter reading, stack temperature, meter temperatures (if needed), and any other appropriate information, before beginning sampling. Begin sampling and target a sampling flow rate similar to that for the field recovery test. Then, at regular intervals (≤5 minutes) during the sampling period, record the date and time, the sample flow rate, the gas meter reading, the stack temperature, the flow meter temperatures (if using a dry gas meter), temperatures of heated equipment such as the vacuum lines and the probes (if heated), and the sampling system vacuum readings. Adjust the sampling flow rate as necessary to maintain the initial sample flow rate. Ensure that the total volume sampled for each run is within 20 percent of the total volume sampled for the field recovery test.</P>
            <P>8.3.3.4 Data Recording. Obtain and record any essential operating data for the facility during the test period, e.g., the barometric pressure must be obtained for correcting sample volume to standard conditions when using a dry gas meter. At the end of the data collection period, record the final gas flow meter reading and the final values of all other essential parameters.</P>
            <P>8.3.3.5 Post-Test Leak Check. When sampling is completed, turn off the sample pump, remove the probe(s) with sorbent traps from the port, and carefully seal the end of each sorbent trap. Perform another leak check of each sampling train with the sorbent trap in place, at the maximum vacuum reached during the sampling period. Record the leakage rates and vacuums. The leakage rate for each train must not exceed 4 percent of the average sampling rate for the data collection period. Following each leak check, carefully release the vacuum in the sample train.</P>

            <P>8.3.3.6 Sample Recovery. Recover each sampled sorbent trap by removing it from the probe and sealing both ends. Wipe any deposited material from the outside of the sorbent <PRTPAGE P="670"/>trap. Place the sorbent trap into an appropriate sample storage container and store/preserve in appropriate manner (see section 8.3.3.8).</P>
            <P>8.3.3.7 Stack Gas Moisture Determination. If the moisture basis of the measurements made with this method (dry) is different from the moisture basis of either: (1) the applicable emission limit; or (2) a Hg CEMS being evaluated for relative accuracy, you must determine the moisture content of the flue gas and correct for moisture using Method 4 in appendix A-3 to this part. If correction of the measured Hg concentrations for moisture is required, at least one Method 4 moisture determination shall be made during each test run.</P>

            <P>8.3.3.8 Sample Handling, Preservation, Storage, and Transport. While the performance criteria of this approach provides for verification of appropriate sample handling, it is still important that the user consider, determine and plan for suitable sample preservation, storage, transport, and holding times for these measurements. Therefore, procedures in ASTM D6911-15 “Standard Guide for Packaging and Shipping Environmental Samples for Laboratory Analysis” (incorporated by reference-see 40 CFR 60.17) shall be followed for all samples, where appropriate. To avoid Hg contamination of the samples, special attention should be paid to cleanliness during transport, field handling, sampling, recovery, and laboratory analysis, as well as during preparation of the sorbent cartridges. Collection and analysis of blank samples (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> reagent, sorbent, field, etc.) is useful in verifying the absence or source of contaminant Hg.</P>
            <P>8.3.3.9 Sample Custody. Proper procedures and documentation for sample chain of custody are critical to ensuring data integrity. The chain of custody procedures in ASTM D4840-99 “Standard Guide for Sampling Chain-of-Custody Procedures” shall be followed for all samples (including field samples and blanks).</P>

            <P>10.1 Only NIST-certified and NIST-traceable calibration standards (i.e., calibration gases, solutions, etc.) shall be used for the spiking and analytical procedures in this method.</P>
            <P>10.2 Gas Flow Meter Calibration.</P>

            <P>10.2.1 Preliminaries. The manufacturer or equipment supplier of the gas flow meter should perform all necessary set-up, testing, programming, etc., and should provide the end user with any necessary instructions, to <PRTPAGE P="672"/>ensure that the meter will give an accurate readout of dry gas volume in standard cubic meters for this method.</P>

            <P>10.2.2 Initial Calibration. Prior to its initial use, a calibration of the gas flow meter shall be performed. The initial calibration may be done by the manufacturer, by the equipment supplier, or by the end user. If the flow meter is volumetric in nature (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, a dry gas meter), the manufacturer or end user may perform a direct volumetric calibration using any gas. For a mass flow meter, the manufacturer, equipment supplier, or end user may calibrate the meter using either: (1) A bottled gas mixture containing 12 ±0.5% CO<E T="52">2</E>, 7 ±0.5% O<E T="52">2</E>, and balance N<E T="52">2</E> (when this method is applied to coal-fired boilers); (2) a bottled gas mixture containing CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, and N<E T="52">2</E> in proportions representative of the expected stack gas composition; or (3) the actual stack gas.</P>
            <P>10.2.2.1 Initial Calibration Procedures. Determine an average calibration factor (Y) for the gas flow meter by calibrating it at three sample flow rate settings covering the range of sample flow rates at which the sampling system will be operated. You may either follow the procedures in section 10.3.1 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part or in section 16 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part. If a dry gas meter is being calibrated, use at least five revolutions of the meter at each flow rate.</P>
            <P>10.2.2.2 Alternative Initial Calibration Procedures. Alternatively, you may perform the initial calibration of the gas flow meter using a reference gas flow meter (RGFM). The RGFM may be: (1) A wet test meter calibrated according to section 10.3.1 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part; (2) a gas flow metering device calibrated at multiple flow rates using the procedures in section 16 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part; or (3) a NIST-traceable calibration device capable of measuring volumetric flow to an accuracy of 1 percent. To calibrate the gas flow meter using the RGFM, proceed as follows: While the Method 30B sampling system is sampling the actual stack gas or a compressed gas mixture that simulates the stack gas composition (as applicable), connect the RGFM to the discharge of the system. Care should be taken to minimize the dead volume between the gas flow meter being tested and the RGFM. Concurrently measure dry stack gas volume with the RGFM and the flow meter being calibrated for at least 10 minutes at each of three flow rates covering the typical range of operation of the sampling system. For each set of concurrent measurements, record the total sample volume, in units of dry standard cubic meters (dscm), measured by the RGFM and the gas flow meter being tested.</P>

            <P>10.2.2.3 Initial Calibration Factor. Calculate an individual calibration factor Y<E T="52">i</E> at each tested flow rate from section 10.2.2.1 or 10.2.2.2 of this method (as applicable) by taking the ratio of the reference sample volume to the sample volume recorded by the gas flow meter. Average the three Y<E T="52">i</E> values, to determine Y, the calibration factor for the flow meter. Each of the three individual values of Y<E T="52">i</E> must be within ±0.02 of Y. Except as otherwise provided in sections 10.2.2.4 and 10.2.2.5 of this method, use the average Y value from the initial 3-point calibration to adjust subsequent gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter.</P>

            <P>10.2.2.4 Pretest On-Site Calibration Check (Optional). For a mass flow meter, if the most recent 3-point calibration of the flow meter was performed using a compressed gas mixture, you may want to conduct the following on-site calibration check prior to testing, to ensure that the flow meter will accurately measure the volume of the stack gas: While sampling stack gas, check the calibration of the flow meter at one intermediate flow rate setting representative of normal operation of the sampling system. If the pretest calibration check shows that the value of Y<E T="52">i</E>, the calibration factor at the tested flow rate, differs from the current value of Y by more than 5 percent, perform a full 3-point recalibration of the meter using stack gas to determine a new value of Y, and (except as otherwise provided in section 10.2.2.5 of this method) apply the new Y value to the data recorded during the field test.</P>

            <P>10.2.2.5 Post-Test Calibration Check. Check the calibration of the gas flow meter following each field test at one intermediate flow rate setting, either at, or in close proximity to, the average sample flow rate during the field test. For dry gas meters, ensure at least three revolutions of the meter during the calibration check. For mass flow meters, this check must be performed before leaving the test site, while sampling stack gas. If a one-point calibration check shows that the value of Y<E T="52">i</E> at the tested flow rate differs by more than 5 percent from the current value of Y, repeat the full 3-point calibration procedure to determine a new value of Y, and apply the new Y value to the gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter during the field test that was just completed. For mass flow meters, perform the 3-point recalibration while sampling stack gas.</P>

            <P>10.3 Thermocouples and Other Temperature Sensors. Use the procedures and criteria in Section 10.3 of Method 2 in appendix A-1 to this part to calibrate in-stack temperature sensors and thermocouples. Dial thermometers shall be calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers or equivalent. Calibrations must be performed prior to initial use and before each field test thereafter. At each calibration point, the absolute temperature measured by the temperature sensor must agree to within ±1.5 percent of the temperature measured with the reference <PRTPAGE P="673"/>sensor, otherwise the sensor may not continue to be used.</P>
            <P>10.4 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer or other NIST-traceable barometer as per Section 10.6 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part. Calibration must be performed prior to initial use and before each test program, and the absolute pressure measured by the barometer must agree to within ±10 mm Hg of the pressure measured by the mercury or other NIST-traceable barometer, otherwise the barometer may not continue to be used.</P>
            <P>10.5 Other Sensors and Gauges. Calibrate all other sensors and gauges according to the procedures specified by the instrument manufacturer(s).</P>
            <P>10.6 Analytical System Calibration. See section 11.1 of this method.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedures</HD>

            <P>The analysis of Hg in the field and quality control samples may be conducted using any instrument or technology capable of quantifying total Hg from the sorbent media and meeting the performance criteria in this method. Because multiple analytical approaches, equipment and techniques are appropriate for the analysis of sorbent traps, it is not possible to provide detailed, technique-specific analytical procedures. As they become available, detailed procedures for a variety of candidate analytical approaches will be posted at <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.</E>
            </P>
            <P>11.1 Analytical System Calibration. Perform a multipoint calibration of the analyzer at three or more upscale points over the desired quantitative range (multiple calibration ranges shall be calibrated, if necessary). The field samples analyzed must fall within a calibrated, quantitative range and meet the performance criteria specified below. For samples suitable for aliquotting, a series of dilutions may be needed to ensure that the samples fall within a calibrated range. However, for sorbent media samples consumed during analysis (e.g., when using thermal desorption techniques), extra care must be taken to ensure that the analytical system is appropriately calibrated prior to sample analysis. The calibration curve range(s) should be determined such that the levels of Hg mass expected to be collected and measured will fall within the calibrated range. The calibration curve may be generated by directly introducing standard solutions into the analyzer or by spiking the standards onto the sorbent media and then introducing into the analyzer after preparing the sorbent/standard according to the particular analytical technique. For each calibration curve, the value of the square of the linear correlation coefficient, i.e., r<SU>2</SU>, must be ≥0.99, and the analyzer response must be within ±10 percent of the reference value at each upscale calibration point. Calibrations must be performed on the day of the analysis, before analyzing any of the samples. Following calibration, an independent standard shall be analyzed. The measured value of the independently prepared standard must be within ±10 percent of the expected value.</P>
            <P>11.2 Sample Preparation. Carefully separate the sections of each sorbent trap. Combine for analysis all materials associated with each section; any supporting substrate that the sample gas passes through prior to entering a media section (e.g., glass wool separators, acid gas traps, etc.) must be analyzed with that segment.</P>

            <P>11.3 Field Sample Analyses. Analyze the sorbent trap samples following the same procedures that were used for conducting the Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> analytical bias tests. The individual sections of the sorbent trap and their respective components must be analyzed separately (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, section 1 and its components, then section 2 and its components). All sorbent trap section 1 sample analyses must be within the calibrated range of the analytical system as specified in Table 9-1. For wet analyses, the sample can simply be diluted to fall within the calibrated range. However, for the destructive thermal analyses, samples that are not within the calibrated range cannot be re-analyzed. As a result, the sample cannot be validated, and another sample must be collected. It is strongly suggested that the analytical system be calibrated over multiple ranges so that thermally analyzed samples fall within the calibrated range. The total mass of Hg measured in each sorbent trap section 1 must also fall within the lower and upper mass limits established during the initial Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> analytical bias test. If a sample is analyzed and found to fall outside of these limits, it is acceptable for an additional Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> analytical bias test to be performed that now includes this level. However, some samples (e.g., the mass collected in trap section 2), may have Hg levels so low that it may not be possible to quantify them in the analytical system's calibrated range. Because a reliable estimate of these low-level Hg measurements is necessary to fully validate the emissions data, the MDL (see section 8.2.2.1 of this method) is used to establish the minimum amount that can be detected and reported. If the measured mass or concentration is below the lowest point in the calibration curve and above the MDL, the analyst must estimate the mass or concentration of the sample based on the analytical instrument response relative to an additional calibration standard at a concentration or mass between the MDL and the lowest point in the calibration curve. This is accomplished by establishing a response factor (e.g., area counts per Hg mass or concentration) and estimating the amount of Hg present in the sample based on the analytical response and this response factor.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <PRTPAGE P="674"/>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
              <P>The analysis of a particular sample results in a measured mass above the MDL, but below the lowest point in the calibration curve which is 10 ng. An MDL of 1.3 ng Hg has been established by the MDL study. A calibration standard containing 5 ng of Hg is analyzed and gives an analytical response of 6,170 area counts, which equates to a response factor of 1,234 area counts/ng Hg. The analytical response for the sample is 4,840 area counts. Dividing the analytical response for the sample (4,840 area counts) by the response factor gives 3.9 ng Hg, which is the estimated mass of Hg in the sample.</P>

            <P>11.4 Analysis of Continuing Calibration Verification Standard (CCVS). After no more than 10 samples and at the end of each set of analyses, a continuing calibration verification standard must be analyzed. The measured value of the continuing calibration standard must be within ±10 percent of the expected value.</P>
            <P>11.5 Blanks. The analysis of blanks is optional. The analysis of blanks is useful to verify the absence of, or an acceptable level of, Hg contamination. Blank levels should be considered when quantifying low Hg levels and their potential contribution to meeting the sorbent trap section 2 breakthrough requirements; however, correcting sorbent trap results for blank levels is prohibited.</P>

            <P>How do I validate my data? Measurement data are validated using initial, one-time laboratory tests coupled with test program-specific tests and procedures. The analytical matrix interference test and the Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> analytical bias test described in section 8.2 are used to verify the appropriateness of the selected analytical approach(es) as well as define the valid working ranges for sample analysis. The field recovery test serves to verify the performance of the combined sampling and analysis as applied for each test program. Field test samples are validated by meeting the above requirements as well as meeting specific sampling requirements (i.e., leak checks, paired train agreement, total sample volume agreement with field recovery test samples) and analytical requirements (i.e., valid calibration curve, continuing calibration performance, sample results within calibration curve and bounds of Hg<SU>0</SU> and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> analytical bias test). Complete data validation requirements are summarized in Table 9-1.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 What Is the Purpose and Applicability of Performance Specification 1?</HD>
            <P>Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) provides (1) requirements for the design, performance, and installation of a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) and (2) data computation procedures for evaluating the acceptability of a COMS. It specifies activities for two groups (1) the owner or operator and (2) the opacity monitor manufacturer.</P>
            <P>1.1 Measurement Parameter. PS-1 covers the instrumental measurement of opacity caused by attenuation of projected light due to absorption and scatter of the light by particulate matter in the effluent gas stream.</P>
            <P>1.2 What COMS must comply with PS-1? If you are an owner or operator of a facility with a COMS as a result of this Part, then PS-1 applies to your COMS if one of the following is true:</P>
            <P>(1) Your facility has a new COMS installed after February 6, 2001; or</P>
            <P>(2) Your COMS is replaced, relocated, or substantially refurbished (in the opinion of the regulatory authority) after February 6, 2001; or</P>
            <P>(3) Your COMS was installed before February 6, 2001 and is specifically required by regulatory action other than the promulgation of PS-1 to be recertified.</P>
            <P>If you are an opacity monitor manufacturer, then paragraph 8.2 applies to you.</P>

            <P>1.3 Does PS-1 apply to a facility with an applicable opacity limit less than 10 percent? If you are an owner or operator of a facility with a COMS as a result of this Part and the applicable opacity limit is less than 10 percent, then PS-1 applies to your COMS as described in section 1.2; taking into account (through statistical procedures or otherwise) the uncertainties associated with opacity measurements, and following the conditions for attenuators selection for low opacity applications as outlined in section 8.1(3)(ii). At <PRTPAGE P="678"/>your option, you, the source owner or operator, may select to establish a reduced full scale range of no less than 50 percent opacity instead of the 80 percent as prescribed in section 3.5, if the applicable opacity limit for your facility is less than 10 percent. The EPA recognizes that reducing the range of the analyzer to 50 percent does not necessarily result in any measurable improvement in measurement accuracy at opacity levels less than 10 percent; however, it may allow improved chart recorder interpretation.</P>
            <P>1.4 What data uncertainty issues apply to COMS data? The measurement uncertainties associated with COMS data result from several design and performance factors including limitations on the availability of calibration attenuators for opacities less than about 6 percent (3 percent for single-pass instruments), calibration error tolerances, zero and upscale drift tolerances, and allowance for dust compensation that are significant relative to low opacity levels. The full scale requirements of this PS may also contribute to measurement uncertainty for opacity measurements where the applicable limits are below 10 percent opacity.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 What Are the Basic Requirements of PS-1?</HD>
            <P>PS-1 requires (1) opacity monitor manufacturers comply with a comprehensive series of design and performance specifications and test procedures to certify opacity monitoring equipment before shipment to the end user, (2) the owner or operator to follow installation guidelines, and (3) the owner or operator to conduct a set of field performance tests that confirm the acceptability of the COMS after it is installed.</P>
            <P>2.1 ASTM D6216-12 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17) is the reference for design specifications, manufacturer's performance specifications, and test procedures. The opacity monitor manufacturer must periodically select and test an opacity monitor, that is representative of a group of monitors produced during a specified period or lot, for conformance with the design specifications in ASTM D6216-12. The opacity monitor manufacturer must test each opacity monitor for conformance with the manufacturer's performance specifications in ASTM D6216-12. Note: If the initial certification of the opacity monitor occurred before November 14, 2018 using D6216-98, D6216-03, or D6216-07, it is not necessary to recertify using D6216-12.</P>
            <P>2.2 section 8.1(2) provides guidance for locating an opacity monitor in vertical and horizontal ducts. You are encouraged to seek approval for the opacity monitor location from the appropriate regulatory authority prior to installation.</P>
            <P>2.3 After the COMS is installed and calibrated, the owner or operator must test the COMS for conformance with the field performance specifications in PS-1.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 What Special Definitions Apply to PS-1?</HD>
            <P>3.1 All definitions and discussions from section 3 of ASTM D6216-12 are applicable to PS-1.</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Centroid Area.</E> A concentric area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross-section and is no greater than 1 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.</P>
            <P>3.3 <E T="03">Data Recorder.</E> That portion of the installed COMS that provides a permanent record of the opacity monitor output in terms of opacity. The data recorder may include automatic data reduction capabilities.</P>
            <P>3.4 <E T="03">External Audit Device.</E> The inherent design, equipment, or accommodation of the opacity monitor allowing the independent assessment of the COMS's calibration and operation.</P>
            <P>3.5 <E T="03">Full Scale.</E> The maximum data display output of the COMS. For purposes of recordkeeping and reporting, full scale will be greater than 80 percent opacity.</P>
            <P>3.6 <E T="03">Operational Test Period.</E> A period of time (168 hours) during which the COMS is expected to operate within the established performance specifications without any unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment.</P>

            <P>The procedures required under PS-1 may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. PS-1 does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. Before performing these procedures, you must establish appropriate safety and health practices, and you must determine the applicable regulatory limitations. You should consult the COMS user's manual for specific precautions to take.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 What Equipment and Supplies Do I Need?</HD>
            <P>6.1 <E T="03">Continuous Opacity Monitoring System.</E> You, as owner or operator, are responsible for purchasing an opacity monitor that meets the specifications of ASTM D6216-12, <PRTPAGE P="679"/>including a suitable data recorder or automated data acquisition handling system. Example data recorders include an analog strip chart recorder or more appropriately an electronic data acquisition and reporting system with an input signal range compatible with the analyzer output.</P>
            <P>6.2 <E T="03">Calibration Attenuators.</E> You, as owner or operator, are responsible for purchasing a minimum of three calibration attenuators that meet the requirements of PS-1. Calibration attenuators are optical filters with neutral spectral characteristics. Calibration attenuators must meet the requirements in section 7 and must be of sufficient size to attenuate the entire light beam received by the detector of the COMS. For transmissometers operating over a narrow bandwidth (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> laser), a calibration attenuator's value is determined for the actual operating wavelengths of the transmissometer. Some filters may not be uniform across the face. If errors result in the daily calibration drift or calibration error test, you may want to examine the across-face uniformity of the filter.</P>
            <P>6.3 <E T="03">Calibration Spectrophotometer.</E> Whoever calibrates the attenuators must have a spectrophotometer that meets the following minimum design specifications:</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 What Reagents and Standards Do I Need?</HD>
            <P>You will need to use attenuators (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> neutral density filters) to check the daily calibration drift and calibration error of a COMS. Attenuators are designated as either primary or secondary based on how they are calibrated.</P>
            <P>7.1 Attenuators are designated primary in one of two ways:</P>
            <P>(1) They are calibrated by NIST; or</P>
            <P>(2) They are calibrated on a 6-month frequency through the assignment of a luminous transmittance value in the following manner:</P>
            <P>(i) Use a spectrophotometer meeting the specifications of section 6.3 to calibrate the required filters. Verify the spectrophotometer calibration through use of a NIST 930D Standard Reference Material (SRM). A SRM 930D consists of three neutral density glass filters and a blank, each mounted in a cuvette. The wavelengths and temperature to be used in the calibration are listed on the NIST certificate that accompanies the reported values. Determine and record a transmittance of the SRM values at the NIST wavelengths (three filters at five wavelengths each for a total of 15 determinations). Calculate a percent difference between the NIST certified values and the spectrophotometer response. At least 12 of the 15 differences (in percent) must be within ±0.5 percent of the NIST SRM values. No difference can be greater than ±1.0 percent. Recalibrate the SRM or service the spectrophotometer if the calibration results fail the criteria.</P>
            <P>(ii) Scan the filter to be tested and the NIST blank from wavelength 380 to 780 nm, and record the spectrophotometer percent transmittance responses at 10 nm intervals. Test in this sequence: blank filter, tested filter, tested filter rotated 90 degrees in the plane of the filter, blank filter. Calculate the average transmittance at each 10 nm interval. If any pair of the tested filter transmittance values (for the same filter and wavelength) differ by more than ±0.25 percent, rescan the tested filter. If the filter fails to achieve this tolerance, do not use the filter in the calibration tests of the COMS.</P>
            <P>(iii) Correct the tested filter transmittance values by dividing the average tested filter transmittance by the average blank filter transmittance at each 10 nm interval.</P>
            <P>(iv) Calculate the weighted (to the response of the human eye), tested filter transmittance by multiplying the transmittance value by the corresponding response factor shown in table 1-1, to obtain the Source C Human Eye Response.</P>
            <P>(v) Recalibrate the primary attenuators semi-annually if they are used for the required calibration error test. Recalibrate the primary attenuators annually if they are used only for calibration of secondary attenuators.</P>
            <P>7.2 Attenuators are designated secondary if the filter calibration is done using a laboratory-based transmissometer. Conduct the secondary attenuator calibration using a laboratory-based transmissometer calibrated as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Use at least three primary filters of nominal luminous transmittance 50, 70 and 90 percent, calibrated as specified in section 7.1(2)(i), to calibrate the laboratory-based transmissometer. Determine and record the slope of the calibration line using linear regression through zero opacity. The slope of the calibration line must be between 0.99 and 1.01, and the laboratory-based transmissometer reading for each primary filter must not deviate by more than ±2 percent from the linear regression line. If the calibration of the laboratory-based transmissometer yields a slope or individual readings outside the specified ranges, secondary filter calibrations cannot be performed. Determine the source of the variations (either transmissometer performance or changes in the primary filters) and repeat the transmissometer calibration before proceeding with the attenuator calibration.</P>

            <P>(ii) Immediately following the laboratory-based transmissometer calibration, insert <PRTPAGE P="680"/>the secondary attenuators and determine and record the percent effective opacity value per secondary attenuator from the calibration curve (linear regression line).</P>
            <P>(iii) Recalibrate the secondary attenuators semi-annually if they are used for the required calibration error test.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 What Performance Procedures Are Required To Comply With PS-1?</HD>
            <P>Procedures to verify the performance of the COMS are divided into those completed by the owner or operator and those completed by the opacity monitor manufacturer.</P>
            <P>8.1 What procedures must I follow as the Owner or Operator?</P>
            <P>(1) You must purchase an opacity monitor that complies with ASTM D6216-12 and obtain a certificate of conformance from the opacity monitor manufacturer.</P>

            <P>(iii) Alternative Locations and Light Beam Paths. You may select locations and light beam paths, other than those cited above, if you demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator or delegated agent, that the average opacity measured at the alternative location or path is equivalent to the opacity as measured at a location meeting the criteria of sections 8.1(2)(i) and 8.1(2)(ii). The opacity at the alternative location is considered equivalent if (1) the average opacity value measured at the alternative location is within ±10 percent of the average opacity value measured at the location meeting the installation criteria, and (2) the difference between any two average opacity values is less than 2 percent opacity (absolute). You use the following procedure to conduct this demonstration: simultaneously measure the opacities at the two locations or paths for a minimum period of time (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 180-minutes) covering the range of normal operating conditions and compare the results. The opacities of the two locations or paths may be measured at different times, but must represent the same process operating conditions. You may use alternative procedures for determining acceptable locations if those procedures are approved by the Administrator.</P>
            <P>(3) Field Audit Performance Tests. After you install the COMS, you must perform the following procedures and tests on the COMS.</P>
            <P>(i) Optical Alignment Assessment. Verify and record that all alignment indicator devices show proper alignment. A clear indication of alignment is one that is objectively apparent relative to reference marks or conditions.</P>

            <P>(ii) Calibration Error Check. Conduct a three-point calibration error test using three calibration attenuators that produce outlet pathlength corrected, single-pass opacity values shown in ASTM D6216-12, section 7.5. If your applicable limit is less than 10 percent opacity, use attenuators as described in ASTM D6216-12, section 7.5 for applicable standards of 10 to 19 percent opacity. Confirm the external audit device produces the <PRTPAGE P="681"/>proper zero value on the COMS data recorder. Separately, insert each calibration attenuators (low, mid, and high-level) into the external audit device. While inserting each attenuator, (1) ensure that the entire light beam passes through the attenuator, (2) minimize interference from reflected light, and (3) leave the attenuator in place for at least two times the shortest recording interval on the COMS data recorder. Make a total of five nonconsecutive readings for each attenuator. At the end of the test, correlate each attenuator insertion to the corresponding value from the data recorder. Subtract the single-pass calibration attenuator values corrected to the stack exit conditions from the COMS responses. Calculate the arithmetic mean difference, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient of the five measurements value using equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5. Calculate the calibration error as the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence coefficient for each of the three test attenuators using equation 1-6. Report the calibration error test results for each of the three attenuators.</P>
            <P>(iii) System Response Time Check. Using a high-level calibration attenuator, alternately insert the filter five times and remove it from the external audit device. For each filter insertion and removal, measure the amount of time required for the COMS to display 95 percent of the step change in opacity on the COMS data recorder. For the upscale response time, measure the time from insertion to display of 95 percent of the final, steady upscale reading. For the downscale response time, measure the time from removal to display 5 percent of the initial upscale reading. Calculate the mean of the five upscale response time measurements and the mean of the five downscale response time measurements. Report both the upscale and downscale response times.</P>
            <P>(iv) Averaging Period Calculation and Recording Check. After the calibration error check, conduct a check of the averaging period calculation (e.g., 6-minute integrated average). Consecutively insert each of the calibration error check attenuators (low, mid, and high-level) into the external audit device for a period of two times the averaging period plus 1 minute (e.g., 13 minutes for a 6-minute averaging period). Compare the path length corrected opacity value of each attenuator to the valid average value calculated by the COMS data recording device for that attenuator.</P>

            <P>(4) Operational Test Period. Before conducting the operational testing, you must have successfully completed the field audit tests described in sections 8.1(3)(i) through 8.1(3)(iv). Then, you operate the COMS for an initial 168-hour test period while the source is operating under normal operating conditions. If normal operations contain routine source shutdowns, include the source's down periods in the 168-hour operational test period. However, you must ensure that the following minimum source operating time is included in the operational test period: (1) For a batch operation, the operational test period must include at least one full cycle of batch operation during the 168-hour period unless the batch operation is longer than 168 hours or (2) for continuous operating processes, the unit must be operating for at least 50 percent of the 168-hour period. Except during times of instrument zero and upscale calibration drift checks, you must analyze the effluent gas for opacity and produce a permanent record of the COMS output. During this period, you may not perform unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment to the COMS. Automatic zero and calibration adjustments (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> intrinsic adjustments), made by the COMS without operator intervention or initiation, are allowable at any time. At the end of the operational test period, verify and record that the COMS optical alignment is still correct. If the test period is interrupted because of COMS failure, record the time when the failure occurred. After the failure is corrected, you restart the 168-hour period and tests from the beginning (0-hour). During the operational test period, perform the following test procedures:</P>
            <P>(i) Zero Calibration Drift Test. At the outset of the 168-hour operational test period and at each 24-hour interval, the automatic calibration check system must initiate the simulated zero device to allow the zero drift to be determined. Record the COMS response to the simulated zero device. After each 24-hour period, subtract the COMS zero reading from the nominal value of the simulated zero device to calculate the 24-hour zero drift (ZD). At the end of the 168-hour period, calculate the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient of the 24-hour ZDs using equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5. Calculate the sum of the absolute value of the mean and the absolute value of the confidence coefficient using equation 1-6, and report this value as the 24-hour ZD error.</P>
            <P>(ii) Upscale Calibration Drift Test. At each 24-hour interval after the simulated zero device value has been checked, check and record the COMS response to the upscale calibration device. After each 24-hour period, subtract the COMS upscale reading from the nominal value of the upscale calibration device to calculate the 24-hour calibration drift (CD). At the end of the 168-hour period, calculate the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient of the 24-hour CD using equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5. Calculate the sum of the absolute value of the mean and the absolute value of the confidence coefficient using equation 1-6, and report this value as the 24-hour CD error.</P>

            <P>(5) Retesting. If the COMS fails to meet the specifications for the tests conducted under <PRTPAGE P="682"/>the operational test period, make the necessary corrections and restart the operational test period. Depending on the opinion of the enforcing agency, you may have to repeat some or all of the field audit tests.</P>

            <P>1.2 Applicability.</P>

            <P>1.2.1 This specification is for evaluating the acceptability of SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) at the time of installation or soon after and whenever specified in the regulations. The CEMS may include, for certain stationary sources, a diluent (O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E>) monitor.</P>
            <P>1.2.2 This specification is not designed to evaluate the installed CEMS performance over an extended period of time nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and other auxiliary procedures to assess the CEMS performance. The source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly. The Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate the CEMS performance. See 40 CFR Part 60, § 60.13(c).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Performance Specification</HD>
            <P>Procedures for measuring CEMS relative accuracy and calibration drift are outlined. CEMS installation and measurement location specifications, equipment specifications, performance specifications, and data reduction procedures are included. Conformance of the CEMS with the Performance Specification is determined.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions</HD>
            <P>3.1 <E T="03">Calibration Drift (CD)</E> means the difference in the CEMS output readings from the established reference value after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place.</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Centroidal Area</E> means a concentric area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than l percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.</P>
            <P>3.3 <E T="03">Continuous Emission Monitoring System</E> means the total equipment required for the determination of a gas concentration or emission rate. The sample interface, pollutant analyzer, diluent analyzer, and data recorder are the major subsystems of the CEMS.</P>
            <P>3.4 <E T="03">Data Recorder</E> means that portion of the CEMS that provides a permanent record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may include automatic data reduction capabilities.</P>
            <P>3.5 <E T="03">Diluent Analyzer</E> means that portion of the CEMS that senses the diluent gas (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E>) and generates an output proportional to the gas concentration.</P>
            <P>3.6 <E T="03">Path CEMS</E> means a CEMS that measures the gas concentration along a path greater than 10 percent of the equivalent diameter of the stack or duct cross section.</P>
            <P>3.7 <E T="03">Point CEMS</E> means a CEMS that measures the gas concentration either at a single point or along a path equal to or less than 10 percent of the equivalent diameter of the stack or duct cross section.</P>
            <P>3.8 <E T="03">Pollutant Analyzer</E> means that portion of the CEMS that senses the pollutant gas and generates an output proportional to the gas concentration.</P>
            <P>3.9 <E T="03">Relative Accuracy (RA)</E> means the absolute mean difference between the gas concentration or emission rate determined by the CEMS and the value determined by the reference method (RM), plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests, divided by the mean of the RM tests or the applicable emission limit.</P>
            <P>3.10 <E T="03">Sample Interface</E> means that portion of the CEMS used for one or more of the following: sample acquisition, sample delivery, sample conditioning, or protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack effluent.</P>
            <P>3.11 <E T="03">Span Value</E> means the calibration portion of the measurement range as specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement. If the span is not specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement, then it must be a value approximately equivalent to two times the emission standard. For spans less than 500 ppm, the span value may either be rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm, or to the next highest multiple of 100 ppm such that the equivalent emission concentration is not less than 30 percent of the selected span value.</P>

            <P>6.1.1 Data Recorder. The portion of the CEMS that provides a record of analyzer output. The data recorder may record other pertinent data such as effluent flow rates, various instrument temperatures or abnormal CEMS operation. The data recorder output range must include the full range of expected concentration values in the gas stream to be sampled including zero and span values.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 The CEMS design should also allow the determination of calibration drift at the zero and span values. If this is not possible or practical, the design must allow these determinations to be conducted at a low-level value (zero to 20 percent of the span value) and at a value between 50 and 100 percent of the span value. In special cases, the Administrator may approve a single-point calibration drift determination.</P>

            <P>8.1 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 CEMS Installation. Install the CEMS at an accessible location where the pollutant concentration or emission rate measurements are directly representative or can be corrected so as to be representative of the total emissions from the affected facility or at the measurement location cross section. Then select representative measurement points or paths for monitoring in locations that the CEMS will pass the RA test (see section 8.4). If the cause of failure to meet the RA test is determined to be the measurement location and a satisfactory correction technique cannot be established, the Administrator may require the CEMS to be relocated. Suggested measurement locations and points or paths that are most likely to provide data that will meet the RA requirements are listed below.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 CEMS Measurement Location. It is suggested that the measurement location be (1) at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur and (2) at least a half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device.</P>
            <P>8.1.2.1 Point CEMS. It is suggested that the measurement point be (1) no less than 1.0 meter (3.3 ft) from the stack or duct wall or (2) within or centrally located over the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.</P>
            <P>8.1.2.2 Path CEMS. It is suggested that the effective measurement path (1) be totally within the inner area bounded by a line 1.0 meter (3.3 ft) from the stack or duct wall, or (2) have at least 70 percent of the path within the inner 50 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area, or (3) be centrally located over any part of the centroidal area.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Reference Method Measurement Location and Traverse Points.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.1 Select, as appropriate, an accessible RM measurement point at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur, and at least a half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> air heater leakages) and pollutants and diluents are simultaneously measured at the same location, a half diameter may be used in lieu of two equivalent diameters. The CEMS and RM locations need not be the same.</P>

            <P>8.1.3.2 Select traverse points that assure acquisition of representative samples over the stack or duct cross section. The minimum requirements are as follows: Establish a “measurement line” that passes through the centroidal area and in the direction of any expected stratification. If this line interferes with the CEMS measurements, displace the line up to 30 cm (12 in.) (or 5 percent of the equivalent diameter of the cross section, whichever is less) from the centroidal area. Locate three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line. If the measurement line is longer than 2.4 meters (7.8 ft) and pollutant stratification is not expected, the three traverse points may be located on the line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. This option must not be used after wet scrubbers or at points where two streams with different pollutant concentrations are combined. If stratification is suspected, the following procedure is suggested. For rectangular ducts, locate at least nine sample points in the cross section such that sample points are the centroids of similarly-shaped, equal area divisions of the cross section. Measure the pollutant concentration, and, if applicable, the diluent concentration at each point using appropriate reference methods or other appropriate instrument methods that give responses relative to pollutant concentrations. Then calculate the mean value for all sample points. For circular ducts, conduct a 12-point traverse (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> six points on each of the two <PRTPAGE P="691"/>perpendicular diameters) locating the sample points as described in 40 CFR 60, Appendix A, Method 1. Perform the measurements and calculations as described above. Determine if the mean pollutant concentration is more than 10% different from any single point. If so, the cross section is considered to be stratified, and the tester may not use the alternative traverse point locations (...0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall.) but must use the three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the entire measurement line. Other traverse points may be selected, provided that they can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administrator to provide a representative sample over the stack or duct cross section. Conduct all necessary RM tests within 3 cm (1.2 in.) of the traverse points, but no closer than 3 cm (1.2 in.) to the stack or duct wall.</P>
            <P>8.2 Pretest Preparation. Install the CEMS, prepare the RM test site according to the specifications in section 8.1, and prepare the CEMS for operation according to the manufacturer's written instructions.</P>
            <P>8.3 Calibration Drift Test Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 <E T="03">CD Test Period.</E> While the affected facility is operating, determine the magnitude of the CD once each day (at 24-hour intervals) for 7 consecutive calendar days according to the procedure given in sections 8.3.2 through 8.3.4. Alternatively, the CD test may be conducted over 7 consecutive unit operating days.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 The purpose of the CD measurement is to verify the ability of the CEMS to conform to the established CEMS calibration used for determining the emission concentration or emission rate. Therefore, if periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 Conduct the CD test at the two points specified in section 6.1.2. Introduce to the CEMS the reference gases, gas cells, or optical filters (these need not be certified). Record the CEMS response and subtract this value from the reference value (see example data sheet in Figure 2-1).</P>
            <P>8.4 Relative Accuracy Test Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.4.1 RA Test Period. Conduct the RA test according to the procedure given in sections 8.4.2 through 8.4.6 while the affected facility is operating at more than 50 percent of normal load, or as specified in an applicable subpart. The RA test may be conducted during the CD test period.</P>

            <P>8.4.2 Reference Methods. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations, Methods 3B, 4, 6, and 7, or their approved alternatives, are the reference methods for diluent (O<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E>), moisture, SO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E>, respectively.</P>
            <P>8.4.3 Sampling Strategy for RM Tests. Conduct the RM tests in such a way that they will yield results representative of the emissions from the source and can be correlated to the CEMS data. It is preferable to conduct the diluent (if applicable), moisture (if needed), and pollutant measurements simultaneously. However, diluent and moisture measurements that are taken within an hour of the pollutant measurements may be used to calculate dry pollutant concentration and emission rates. In order to correlate the CEMS and RM data properly, note the beginning and end of each RM test period of each run (including the exact time of day) on the CEMS chart recordings or other permanent record of output. Use the following strategies for the RM tests:</P>
            <P>8.4.3.1 For integrated samples (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Methods 6 and Method 4), make a sample traverse of at least 21 minutes, sampling for an equal time at each traverse point (see section 8.1.3.2 for discussion of traverse points.</P>
            <P>8.4.3.2 For grab samples (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Method 7), take one sample at each traverse point, scheduling the grab samples so that they are taken simultaneously (within a 3-minute period) or at an equal interval of time apart over the span of time the CEM pollutant is measured. A test run for grab samples must be made up of at least three separate measurements.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>At times, CEMS RA tests are conducted during new source performance standards performance tests. In these cases, RM results obtained during CEMS RA tests may be used to determine compliance as long as the source and test conditions are consistent with the applicable regulations.</P>
            </NOTE>
            

            <P>8.4.4 Number of RM Tests. Conduct a minimum of nine sets of all necessary RM test runs.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>More than nine sets of RM tests may be performed. If this option is chosen, a maximum of three sets of the test results may be rejected so long as the total number of test results used to determine the RA is greater than or equal to nine. However, all data must be reported, including the rejected data.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.4.5 Correlation of RM and CEMS Data. Correlate the CEMS and the RM test data as to the time and duration by first determining from the CEMS final output (the one used for reporting) the integrated average pollutant concentration or emission rate for each pollutant RM test period. Consider system response time, if important, and confirm that the pair of results are on a consistent moisture, temperature, and diluent concentration basis. Then, compare each integrated CEMS value against the corresponding average RM value. Use the following guidelines to make these comparisons.</P>

            <P>8.4.5.1 If the RM has an integrated sampling technique, make a direct comparison of <PRTPAGE P="692"/>the RM results and CEMS integrated average value.</P>
            <P>8.4.5.2 If the RM has a grab sampling technique, first average the results from all grab samples taken during the test run, and then compare this average value against the integrated value obtained from the CEMS chart recording or output during the run. If the pollutant concentration is varying with time over the run, the arithmetic average of the CEMS value recorded at the time of each grab sample may be used.</P>
            <P>8.4.6 Calculate the mean difference between the RM and CEMS values in the units of the emission standard, the standard deviation, the confidence coefficient, and the relative accuracy according to the procedures in section 12.0.</P>
            <P>8.5 Reporting. At a minimum (check with the appropriate regional office, State, or Local agency for additional requirements, if any), summarize in tabular form the results of the CD tests and the RA tests or alternative RA procedure, as appropriate. Include all data sheets, calculations, charts (records of CEMS responses), cylinder gas concentration certifications, and calibration cell response certifications (if applicable) necessary to confirm that the performance of the CEMS met the performance specifications.</P>

            <P>16.1 Conduct a complete CEMS status check following the manufacturer's written instructions. The check should include operation of the light source, signal receiver, timing mechanism functions, data acquisition and data reduction functions, data recorders, mechanically operated functions (mirror movements, zero pipe operation, calibration gas valve operations, etc.), sample filters, sample line heaters, moisture traps, and other related functions of the <PRTPAGE P="694"/>CEMS, as applicable. All parts of the CEMS shall be functioning properly before proceeding to the alternative RA procedure.</P>
            <P>16.2 Alternative RA Procedure.</P>
            <P>16.2.1 Challenge each monitor (both pollutant and diluent, if applicable) with cylinder gases of known concentrations or calibration cells that produce known responses at two measurement points within the ranges shown in Table 2-2 (Section 18).</P>
            <P>16.2.2 Use a separate cylinder gas (for point CEMS only) or calibration cell (for path CEMS or where compressed gas cylinders can not be used) for measurement points 1 and 2. Challenge the CEMS and record the responses three times at each measurement point. The Administrator may allow dilution of cylinder gas using the performance criteria in Test Method 205, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix M. Use the average of the three responses in determining relative accuracy.</P>
            <P>16.2.3 Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode as nearly as possible. When using cylinder gases, pass the cylinder gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling and as much of the sampling probe as practical. When using calibration cells, the CEMS components used in the normal sampling mode should not be by-passed during the RA determination. These include light sources, lenses, detectors, and reference cells. The CEMS should be challenged at each measurement point for a sufficient period of time to assure adsorption-desorption reactions on the CEMS surfaces have stabilized.</P>
            <P>16.2.4 Use cylinder gases that have been certified by comparison to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) gaseous standard reference material (SRM) or NIST/EPA approved gas manufacturer's certified reference material (CRM) (See Reference 2 in section 17.0) following EPA Traceability Protocol Number 1 (See Reference 3 in section 17.0). As an alternative to Protocol Number 1 gases, CRM's may be used directly as alternative RA cylinder gases. A list of gas manufacturers that have prepared approved CRM's is available from EPA at the address shown in Reference 2. Procedures for preparation of CRM's are described in Reference 2.</P>
            <P>16.2.5 Use calibration cells certified by the manufacturer to produce a known response in the CEMS. The cell certification procedure shall include determination of CEMS response produced by the calibration cell in direct comparison with measurement of gases of known concentration. This can be accomplished using SRM or CRM gases in a laboratory source simulator or through extended tests using reference methods at the CEMS location in the exhaust stack. These procedures are discussed in Reference 4 in section 17.0. The calibration cell certification procedure is subject to approval of the Administrator.</P>

            <P>6.1.1 This specification is the same as section 6.1 of PS 2. The CEMS shall be capable of measuring emission levels under normal conditions and under periods of short-duration peaks of high concentrations. This dual-range capability may be met using two separate analyzers (one for each range) or by using dual-range units which have the capability of measuring both levels with a single unit. In the latter case, when the reading goes above the full-scale measurement value of the lower range, the higher-range operation shall be started automatically. The CEMS recorder range must include zero and a high-level value. Under applications of consistent low emissions, a single-range analyzer is allowed provided normal and spike emissions can be quantified.

Next, reintroduce the zero gas and wait for a stable reading before recording the response time (downscale response time). Repeat the entire procedure until you have three sets of data to determine the mean upscale and downscale response times. The slower or longer of the two means is the system response time.</P>

            <P>1.1 Applicability. a. This specification is to be used for evaluating the acceptability of carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) at the time of or soon after installation and whenever specified in the regulations. The CEMS may include, for certain stationary sources, (a) flow monitoring equipment to allow measurement of the dry volume of stack effluent sampled, and (b) an automatic sampling system.</P>
            <P>b. This specification is not designed to evaluate the installed CEMS' performance over an extended period of time nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and auxiliary procedures to assess the CEMS' performance. The source owner or operator, however, is responsible to properly calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS. To evaluate the CEMS' performance, the Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at times other than the initial test.</P>

            <P>c. The definitions, installation and measurement location specifications, test procedures, data reduction procedures, reporting <PRTPAGE P="702"/>requirements, and bibliography are the same as in PS 3 (for O<E T="52">2</E>) and PS 4A (for CO) except as otherwise noted below.</P>
            <P>1.2 Principle. Installation and measurement location specifications, performance specifications, test procedures, and data reduction procedures are included in this specification. Reference method tests, calibration error tests, calibration drift tests, and interferant tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the specification.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">b. Definitions</HD>
            <P>2.1 <E T="03">Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS).</E> This definition is the same as PS 2 section 2.1 with the following addition. A continuous monitor is one in which the sample to be analyzed passes the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption.</P>
            <P>2.2 <E T="03">Response Time.</E> The time interval between the start of a step change in the system input and when the pollutant analyzer output reaches 95 percent of the final value.</P>
            <P>2.3 <E T="03">Calibration Error (CE).</E> The difference between the concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration generated by a calibration source when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface is challenged. A CE test procedure is performed to document the accuracy and linearity of the CEMS over the entire measurement range.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Installation and Measurement Location Specifications</HD>
            <P>3.1 <E T="03">The CEMS Installation and Measurement Location.</E> This specification is the same as PS 2 section 3.1 with the following additions. Both the CO and O<E T="52">2</E> monitors should be installed at the same general location. If this is not possible, they may be installed at different locations if the effluent gases at both sample locations are not stratified and there is no in-leakage of air between sampling locations.</P>
            <P>3.1.1 <E T="03">Measurement Location.</E> Same as PS 2 section 3.1.1.</P>
            <P>3.1.2 <E T="03">Point CEMS.</E> The measurement point should be within or centrally located over the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.</P>
            <P>3.1.3 <E T="03">Path CEMS.</E> The effective measurement path should: (1) Have at least 70 percent of the path within the inner 50 percent of the stack or duct cross sectional area, or (2) be centrally located over any part of the centroidal area.</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Reference Method (RM) Measurement Location and Traverse Points.</E> This specification is the same as PS 2 section 3.2 with the following additions. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage and CO and O<E T="52">2</E> are simultaneously measured at the same location, one half diameter may be used in place of two equivalent diameters.</P>
            <P>3.3 <E T="03">Stratification Test Procedure.</E> Stratification is defined as the difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0 meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid, is used as a stationary reference point to indicate change in the effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling at the traverse points specified in Method 1 (40 CFR part 60 appendix A). The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.</P>

            <P>8.1 Calibration Drift Test Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.1.1 The CD measurements are to verify the ability of the CERMS to conform to the established CERMS calibrations used for determining the emission rate. Therefore, if periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CERMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD tests immediately before these adjustments, or conduct them in such a way that CD can be determined.</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Conduct the CD tests for pollutant concentration at the two values specified in section 6.1.2 of PS 2. For other parameters that are selectively measured by the CERMS (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> velocity, pressure, flow rate), use two analogous values (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Low: 0-20% of full scale, High: 50-100% of full scale). Introduce to the CERMS the reference signals (these need not be certified). Record the CERMS response to each and subtract this value from the respective reference value (see example data sheet in Figure 6-1).</P>
            <P>8.2 Relative Accuracy Test Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Sampling Strategy for reference method (RM) Tests, Correlation of RM and CERMS Data, and Number of RM Tests are the same as PS 2, sections 8.4.3, 8.4.5, and 8.4.4, respectively. Summarize the results on a data sheet. An example is shown in Figure 6-1. The RA test may be conducted during the CD test period.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Reference Methods. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart of the regulations, the RM for the pollutant gas is the Appendix A method that is cited for compliance test purposes, or its approved alternatives. Methods 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, or 2D, as applicable, are the RMs for the determination of volumetric flow rate.</P>

            <P>1.2.1 This specification is to be used for evaluating a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) that measures a mixture of VOC's and generates a single combined response value. The VOC detection principle may be flame ionization (FI), photoionization (PI), non-dispersive infrared absorption (NDIR), or any other detection principle that is appropriate for the VOC species present in the emission gases and that meets this performance specification. The performance specification includes procedures to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of or soon after its installation and whenever specified in emission regulations or permits. This specification is not designed to evaluate the installed CEMS performance over an extended period of time, nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and other auxiliary procedures to assess the CEMS performance. The source owner or operator, however, is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly. To evaluate the CEMS performance, the Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations in addition to the initial test. See section 60.13(c).</P>

            <P>1.2.2 In most emission circumstances, most VOC monitors can provide only a relative measure of the total mass or volume concentration of a mixture of organic gases, rather than an accurate quantification. This problem is removed when an emission standard is based on a total VOC measurement as obtained with a particular detection principle. In those situations where a true mass or volume VOC concentration is needed, the problem can be mitigated by using the VOC CEMS as a relative indicator of total VOC concentration if statistical analysis indicates that a sufficient margin of compliance exists for this approach to be acceptable. Otherwise, consideration can be given to calibrating the CEMS with a mixture of the same VOC's in the same proportions as they actually occur in the measured source. In those circumstances where only one organic species is present in the source, or where equal incremental amounts of each of the organic species present generate equal CEMS responses, the latter choice can be more easily achieved.<PRTPAGE P="708"/>

            <P>1.1 <E T="03">Applicability.</E> These performance specifications apply to hydrocarbon (HC) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) installed on stationary sources. The specifications include procedures which are intended to be used to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of its installation or whenever specified in regulations or permits. The procedures are not designed to evaluate CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible for the proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of the CEMS at all times.</P>
            <P>1.2 <E T="03">Principle.</E> A gas sample is extracted from the source through a heated sample line and heated filter to a flame ionization detector (FID). Results are reported as volume concentration equivalents of propane. Installation and measurement location specifications, performance and equipment specifications, test and data reduction procedures, and brief quality assurance guidelines are included in the specifications. Calibration drift, calibration error, and response <PRTPAGE P="709"/>time tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the specifications.</P>

            <P>2.2 <E T="03">Instrument Measurement Range.</E> The difference between the minimum and maximum concentration that can be measured by a specific instrument. The minimum is often stated or assumed to be zero and the range expressed only as the maximum.</P>
            <P>2.3 <E T="03">Span or Span Value.</E> Full scale instrument measurement range. The span value must be documented by the CEMS manufacturer with laboratory data.</P>
            <P>2.4 <E T="03">Calibration Gas.</E> A known concentration of a gas in an appropriate diluent gas.</P>
            <P>2.5 <E T="03">Calibration Drift (CD).</E> The difference in the CEMS output readings from the established reference value after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. A CD test is performed to demonstrate the stability of the CEMS calibration over time.</P>
            <P>2.6 <E T="03">Response Time.</E> The time interval between the start of a step change in the system input (e.g., change of calibration gas) and the time when the data recorder displays 95 percent of the final value.</P>
            <P>2.7 <E T="03">Accuracy.</E> A measurement of agreement between a measured value and an accepted or true value, expressed as the percentage difference between the true and measured values relative to the true value. For these performance specifications, accuracy is checked by conducting a calibration error (CE) test.</P>
            <P>2.8 <E T="03">Calibration Error (CE).</E> The difference between the concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration of the cylinder gas. A CE test procedure is performed to document the accuracy and linearity of the monitoring equipment over the entire measurement range.</P>
            <P>2.9 <E T="03">Performance Specification Test (PST) Period.</E> The period during which CD, CE, and response time tests are conducted.</P>
            <P>2.10 <E T="03">Centroidal Area.</E> A concentric area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than 1 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Installation and Measurement Location Specifications</HD>
            <P>3.1 <E T="03">CEMS Installation and Measurement Locations.</E> The CEMS must be installed in a location in which measurements representative of the source's emissions can be obtained. The optimum location of the sample interface for the CEMS is determined by a number of factors, including ease of access for calibration and maintenance, the degree to which sample conditioning will be required, the degree to which it represents total emissions, and the degree to which it represents the combustion situation in the firebox (where applicable). The location should be as free from in-leakage influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flow disturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent duct diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameter upstream from the exhaust or control device. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated as per 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1. If these criteria are not achievable or if the location is otherwise less than optimum, the possibility of stratification should be investigated as described in section 3.2. The measurement point must be within the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Stratification Test Procedure.</E> Stratification is defined as a difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0 meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid, is used as a stationary reference point to indicate the change in effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling at the traverse points specified in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, method 1. The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.<PRTPAGE P="710"/>

            <P>6.2.1 <E T="03">Sampling Strategy.</E> Conduct the CD test at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days using calibration gases at the two daily concentration levels specified in section 4.3. Introduce the two calibration gases into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical. The gas must pass through all CEM components used during normal sampling. If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined. Record the CEMS response and subtract this value from the reference (calibration gas) value. To meet the specification, none of the differences may exceed 3 percent of the span of the CEM.</P>

            <P>8.3 7-Day Calibration Error (CE) Test Period. At the beginning of each 24-hour period, set the initial instrument setpoints by conducting a multi-point calibration for each compound. The multi-point calibration shall meet the requirements in section 13.3. Throughout the 24-hour period, sample and analyze the stack gas at the sampling intervals prescribed in the regulation or permit. At the end of the 24 hour period, inject the three calibration gases for each compound in triplicate and determine the average instrument response. Determine the CE for each pollutant at each level using the equation in section 9-2.</P>
            <P>Each CE shall be ≤10 percent. Repeat this procedure six more times for a total of 7 consecutive days.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Performance Specification 11—Specifications and Test Procedures for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 What Are the Purpose and Applicability of Performance Specification 11?</HD>
            <P>The purpose of Performance Specification 11 (PS-11) is to establish the initial installation and performance procedures that are required for evaluating the acceptability of a particulate matter (PM) continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS); it is not to evaluate the ongoing performance of your PM CEMS over an extended period of time, nor to identify specific calibration techniques and auxiliary procedures to assess CEMS performance. You will find procedures for evaluating the ongoing performance of a PM CEMS in Procedure 2 of Appendix F—Quality Assurance Requirements for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used at Stationary Sources.</P>
            <P>1.1 Under what conditions does PS-11 apply to my PM CEMS? The PS-11 applies to your PM CEMS if you are required by any provision of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to install and operate PM CEMS.</P>
            <P>1.2 When must I comply with PS-11? You must comply with PS-11 when directed by the applicable rule that requires you to install and operate a PM CEMS.</P>

            <P>1.3 What other monitoring must I perform? To report your PM emissions in units of the emission standard, you may need to monitor additional parameters to correct the PM concentration reported by your PM CEMS. Your CEMS may include the components <PRTPAGE P="717"/>listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) A diluent monitor (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> O<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, or other CEMS specified in the applicable regulation), which must meet its own performance specifications (also found in this appendix),</P>
            <P>(2) Auxiliary monitoring equipment to allow measurement, determination, or input of the flue gas temperature, pressure, moisture content, and/or dry volume of stack effluent sampled, and</P>

            <P>(3) An automatic sampling system. The performance of your PM CEMS and the establishment of its correlation to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of mass concentration as measured by your PM CEMS (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> milligrams per actual cubic meter (mg/acm) or milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm)).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 What Are the Basic Requirements of PS-11?</HD>
            <P>The PS-11 requires you to perform initial installation and calibration procedures that confirm the acceptability of your CEMS when it is installed and placed into operation. You must develop a site-specific correlation of your PM CEMS response against manual gravimetric reference method measurements (including those made using EPA Methods 5, 5I, or 17).</P>

            <P>2.1 What types of PM CEMS technologies are covered? Several different types of PM CEMS technologies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> light scattering, Beta attenuation, etc.) can be designed with in-situ or extractive sample gas handling systems. Each PM CEMS technology and sample gas handling technology has certain site-specific advantages. You should select and install a PM CEMS that is appropriate for the flue gas conditions at your source.</P>
            <P>2.2 How is PS-11 different from other performance specifications? The PS-11 is based on a technique of correlating PM CEMS responses relative to emission concentrations determined by the reference method. This technique is called “the correlation.” This differs from CEMS used to measure gaseous pollutants that have available calibration gases of known concentration. Because the type and characteristics of PM vary from source to source, a single PM correlation, applicable to all sources, is not possible.</P>

            <P>2.3 How are the correlation data handled? You must carefully review your manual reference method data and your PM CEMS responses to include only valid, high-quality data. For the correlation, you must convert the manual reference method data to measurement conditions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> wet or dry basis) that are consistent with your PM CEMS. Then, you must correlate the manual method and PM CEMS data in terms of the output as received from the monitor (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> milliamps). At the appropriate PM CEMS response specified in section 13.2 of this performance specification, you must calculate the confidence interval half range and tolerance interval half range as a percentage of the applicable PM concentration emission limit and compare the confidence interval and tolerance interval percentages with the performance criteria. Also, you must calculate the correlation coefficient and compare the correlation coefficient with the applicable performance criterion specified in section 13.2 of this performance specification.</P>
            <P>Situations may arise where you will need two or more correlations. If you need multiple correlations, you must collect sufficient data for each correlation, and each correlation must satisfy the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this performance specification.</P>
            <P>2.4 How do I design my PM CEMS correlation program? When planning your PM CEMS correlation effort, you must address each of the items in paragraphs (1) through (7) of this section to enhance the probability of success. You will find each of these elements further described in this performance specification or in the applicable reference method procedure.</P>
            <P>(1) What type of PM CEMS should I select? You should select a PM CEMS that is appropriate for your source with technical consideration for potential factors such as interferences, site-specific configurations, installation location, flue gas conditions, PM concentration range, and other PM characteristics. You can find guidance on which technology is best suited for specific situations in our report “Current Knowledge of Particulate Matter (PM) Continuous Emission Monitoring” (PM CEMS Knowledge Document, see section 16.5).</P>
            <P>(2) Where should I install my PM CEMS? Your PM CEMS must be installed in a location that is most representative of PM emissions, as determined by the reference method, such that the correlation between PM CEMS response and emissions determined by the reference method will meet these performance specifications. Care must be taken in selecting a location and measurement point to minimize problems due to flow disturbances, cyclonic flow, and varying PM stratification.</P>

            <P>(3) How should I record my CEMS data? You need to ensure that your PM CEMS and data logger are set up to collect and record all normal emission levels and excursions. You must ensure that your data logger and PM CEMS have been properly programmed to accept and transfer status signals of valid monitor operation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> flags for internal calibration, suspect data, or maintenance periods).</P>

            <P>(4) What CEMS data should I review? You must review drift data daily to document proper operation. You must also ensure that any audit material is appropriate for the typical operating range of your PM CEMS.<PRTPAGE P="718"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) How long should I operate my PM CEMS before conducting the initial correlation test? You should allow sufficient time for your PM CEMS to operate for you to become familiar with your PM CEMS.</P>
            <P>(i) You should observe PM CEMS response over time during normal and varying process conditions. This will ensure that your PM CEMS has been properly set up to operate at a range that is compatible with the concentrations and characteristics of PM emissions for your source. You should use this information to establish the range of operating conditions necessary to determine the correlations of PM CEMS data to manual reference method measurements over a wide operating range.</P>
            <P>(ii) You must determine the types of process changes that will influence, on a definable and repeatable basis, flue gas PM concentrations and the resulting PM CEMS responses. You may find this period useful to make adjustments to your planned approach for operating your PM CEMS at your source. For instance, you may change the measurement range or batch sampling period to something other than those you initially planned to use.</P>
            <P>(6) How do I conduct the initial correlation test? When conducting the initial correlation test of your PM CEMS response to PM emissions determined by the reference method, you must pay close attention to accuracy and details. Your PM CEMS must be operating properly. You must perform the manual reference method testing accurately, with attention to eliminating site-specific systemic errors. You must coordinate the timing of the manual reference method testing with the sampling cycle of your PM CEMS. You must complete a minimum of 15 manual reference method tests. You must perform the manual reference method testing over the full range of PM CEMS responses that correspond to normal operating conditions for your source and control device and will result in the widest range of emission concentrations.</P>
            <P>(7) How should I perform the manual reference method testing? You must perform the manual reference method testing in accordance with specific rule requirements, coordinated closely with PM CEMS and process operations. It is highly recommended that you use paired trains for the manual reference method testing. You must perform the manual reference method testing over a suitable PM concentration range that corresponds to the full range of normal process and control device operating conditions. Because the manual reference method testing for this correlation test is not for compliance reporting purposes, you may conduct the reference method test runs for less than the typical minimum test run duration of 1 hour.</P>
            <P>(8) What do I do with the manual reference method data and PM CEMS data? You must complete each of the activities in paragraphs (8)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>

            <P>(i) Screen the manual reference method data for validity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> isokinetics, leak checks), quality assurance, and quality control (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> outlier identification).</P>
            <P>(ii) Screen your PM CEMS data for validity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> daily drift check requirements) and quality assurance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> flagged data).</P>

            <P>(iii) Convert the manual reference method test data into measurement units (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mg/acm) consistent with the measurement conditions of your PM CEMS.</P>
            <P>(iv) Calculate the correlation equation(s) as specified in section 12.3.</P>
            <P>(v) Calculate the correlation coefficient, confidence interval half range, and tolerance interval half range for the complete set of PM CEMS and reference method correlation data for comparison with the correlation performance criteria specified in section 13.2.</P>
            <P>2.5 What other procedures must I perform? Before conducting the initial correlation test, you must successfully complete a 7-day drift test (See section 8.5).</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Are There Any Potential Interferences for My PM CEMS?</HD>

            <P>Yes, condensible water droplets or condensible acid gas aerosols (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> those with condensation temperatures above those specified by the reference method) at the measurement location can be interferences for your PM CEMS if the necessary precautions are not met.</P>
            <P>4.1 Where are interferences likely to occur? Interferences may develop if your CEMS is installed downstream of a wet air pollution control system or any other conditions that produce flue gases, which, at your PM CEMS measurement point, normally or occasionally contain entrained water droplets or condensible salts before release to the atmosphere.</P>
            <P>4.2 How do I deal with interferences? We recommend that you use a PM CEMS that extracts and heats representative samples of the flue gas for measurement to simulate results produced by the reference method for conditions such as those described in section 4.1. Independent of your PM CEMS measurement technology and extractive technique, you should have a configuration simulating the reference method to ensure that:</P>
            <P>(1) No formation of new PM or deposition of PM occurs in sample delivery from the stack or duct; and</P>
            <P>(2) No condensate accumulates in the sample flow measurement apparatus.</P>
            <P>4.3 What PM CEMS measurement technologies should I use? You should use a PM CEMS measurement technology that is free of interferences from any condensible constituent in the flue gas.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 What Do I Need To Know To Ensure the Safety of Persons Using PS-11?</HD>
            <P>People using the procedures required under PS-11 may be exposed to hazardous materials, operations, site conditions, and equipment. This performance specification does not purport to address all of the safety issues associated with its use. It is your responsibility to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations before performing these procedures. You must consult your CEMS user's manual and other reference materials recommended by the reference method for specific precautions to be taken.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 What Equipment and Supplies Do I Need?</HD>
            <P>Different types of PM CEMS use different operating principles. You should select an appropriate PM CEMS based on your site-specific configurations, flue gas conditions, and PM characteristics.</P>
            <P>(1) Your PM CEMS must sample the stack effluent continuously or, for batch sampling PM CEMS, intermittently.</P>
            <P>(2) You must ensure that the averaging time, the number of measurements in an average, the minimum data availability, and the averaging procedure for your CEMS conform with those specified in the applicable emission regulation.</P>
            <P>(3) Your PM CEMS must include, as a minimum, the equipment described in sections 6.1 through 6.7.</P>
            <P>6.1 What equipment is needed for my PM CEMS's sample interface? Your PM CEMS's sample interface must be capable of delivering a representative sample of the flue gas to your PM CEMS. This subsystem may be required to heat the sample gas to avoid PM deposition or moisture condensation, provide dilution air, perform other gas conditioning to prepare the sample for analysis, or measure the sample volume or flow rate.</P>

            <P>(1) If your PM CEMS is installed downstream of a wet air pollution control system such that the flue gases normally or occasionally contain entrained water droplets, we recommend that you select a sampling system that includes equipment to extract and heat a representative sample of the flue gas for measurement so that the pollutant monitor portion of your CEMS measures only dry PM. Heating should be sufficient to raise the temperature of the extracted flue <PRTPAGE P="721"/>gas above the water condensation temperature and should be maintained at all times and at all points in the sample line from where the flue gas is extracted, including the pollutant monitor and any sample flow measurement devices.</P>
            <P>(2) You must consider the measured conditions of the sample gas stream to ensure that manual reference method test data are converted to units of PM concentration that are appropriate for the correlation calculations. Additionally, you must identify what, if any, additional auxiliary data from other monitoring and handling systems are necessary to convert your PM CEMS response into the units of the PM standard.</P>
            <P>(3) If your PM CEMS is an extractive type and your source's flue gas volumetric flow rate varies by more than 10 percent from nominal, your PM CEMS should maintain an isokinetic sampling rate (within 10 percent of true isokinetic). If your extractive-type PM CEMS does not maintain an isokinetic sampling rate, you must use actual site-specific data or data from a similar installation to prove to us, the State, and/or local enforcement agency that isokinetic sampling is not necessary.</P>
            <P>6.2 What type of equipment is needed for my PM CEMS? Your PM CEMS must be capable of providing an electronic output that can be correlated to the PM concentration.</P>
            <P>(1) Your PM CEMS must be able to perform zero and upscale drift checks. You may perform these checks manually, but performing these checks automatically is preferred.</P>
            <P>(2) We recommend that you select a PM CEMS that is capable of performing automatic diagnostic checks and sending instrument status signals (flags) to the data recorder.</P>
            <P>(3) If your PM CEMS is an extractive type that measures the sample volume and uses the measured sample volume as part of calculating the output value, your PM CEMS must be able to perform a check of the sample volume to verify the accuracy of the sample volume measuring equipment. The sample volume check must be conducted daily and at the normal sampling rate of your PM CEMS.</P>
            <P>6.3 What is the appropriate measurement range for my PM CEMS? Initially, your PM CEMS must be set up to measure over the expected range of your source's PM emission concentrations during routine operations. You may change the measurement range to a more appropriate range prior to correlation testing.</P>
            <P>6.4 What if my PM CEMS does automatic range switching? Your PM CEMS may be equipped to perform automatic range switching so that it is operating in a range most sensitive to the detected concentrations. If your PM CEMS does automatic range switching, you must configure the data recorder to handle the recording of data values in multiple ranges during range-switching intervals.</P>
            <P>6.5 What averaging time and sample intervals should be used? Your CEMS must sample the stack effluent such that the averaging time, the number of measurements in an average, the minimum sampling time, and the averaging procedure for reporting and determining compliance conform with those specified in the applicable regulation. Your PM CEMS must be designed to meet the specified response time and cycle time established in this performance specification (see section 13.3).</P>
            <P>6.6 What type of equipment is needed for my data recorder? Your CEMS data recorder must be able to accept and record electronic signals from all the monitors associated with your PM CEMS.</P>
            <P>(1) Your data recorder must record the signals from your PM CEMS that can be correlated to PM mass concentrations. If your PM CEMS uses multiple ranges, your data recorder must identify what range the measurement was made in and provide range-adjusted results.</P>
            <P>(2) Your data recorder must accept and record monitor status signals (flagged data).</P>
            <P>(3) Your data recorder must accept signals from auxiliary data monitors, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>6.7 What other equipment and supplies might I need? You may need other supporting equipment as defined by the applicable reference method(s) (see section 7) or as specified by your CEMS manufacturer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 What Reagents and Standards Do I Need?</HD>
            <P>You will need reference standards or procedures to perform the zero drift check, the upscale drift check, and the sample volume check.</P>
            <P>7.1 What is the reference standard value for the zero drift check? You must use a zero check value that is no greater than 20 percent of the PM CEMS's response range. You must obtain documentation on the zero check value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.</P>
            <P>7.2 What is the reference standard value for the upscale drift check? You must use an upscale check value that produces a response between 50 and 100 percent of the PM CEMS's response range. For a PM CEMS that produces output over a range of 4 mA to 20 mA, the upscale check value must produce a response in the range of 12 mA to 20 mA. You must obtain documentation on the upscale check value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.</P>

            <P>7.3 What is the reference standard value for the sample volume check? You must use a reference standard value or procedure that produces a sample volume value equivalent to the normal sampling rate. You must obtain documentation on the sample volume value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.<PRTPAGE P="722"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 What Performance Specification Test Procedure Do I Follow?</HD>
            <P>You must complete each of the activities in sections 8.1 through 8.8 for your performance specification test.</P>
            <P>8.1 How should I select and set up my equipment? You should select a PM CEMS that is appropriate for your source, giving consideration to potential factors such as flue gas conditions, interferences, site-specific configuration, installation location, PM concentration range, and other PM characteristics. Your PM CEMS must meet the equipment specifications in sections 6.1 and 6.2.</P>
            <P>(1) You should select a PM CEMS that is appropriate for the flue gas conditions at your source. If your source's flue gas contains entrained water droplets, we recommend that your PM CEMS include a sample delivery and conditioning system that is capable of extracting and heating a representative sample.</P>
            <P>(i) Your PM CEMS must maintain the sample at a temperature sufficient to prevent moisture condensation in the sample line before analysis of PM.</P>
            <P>(ii) If condensible PM is an issue, we recommend that you operate your PM CEMS to maintain the sample gas temperature at the same temperature as the reference method filter.</P>
            <P>(iii) Your PM CEMS must avoid condensation in the sample flow rate measurement lines.</P>
            <P>(2) Some PM CEMS do not have a wide measurement range capability. Therefore, you must select a PM CEMS that is capable of measuring the full range of PM concentrations expected from your source from normal levels through the emission limit concentration.</P>
            <P>(3) Some PM CEMS are sensitive to particle size changes, water droplets in the gas stream, particle charge, stack gas velocity changes, or other factors. Therefore, you should select a PM CEMS appropriate for the emission characteristics of your source.</P>
            <P>(4) We recommend that you consult your PM CEMS vendor to obtain basic recommendations on the instrument capabilities and setup configuration. You are ultimately responsible for setup and operation of your PM CEMS.</P>
            <P>8.2 Where do I install my PM CEMS? You must install your PM CEMS at an accessible location downstream of all pollution control equipment. You must perform your PM CEMS concentration measurements from a location considered representative or be able to provide data that can be corrected to be representative of the total PM emissions as determined by the manual reference method.</P>
            <P>(1) You must select a measurement location that minimizes problems due to flow disturbances, cyclonic flow, and varying PM stratification (refer to Method 1 for guidance).</P>

            <P>(2) If you plan to achieve higher emissions for correlation test purposes by adjusting the performance of the air pollution control device (per section 8.6(4)(i)), you must locate your PM CEMS and reference method sampling points well downstream of the control device (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> downstream of the induced draft fan), in order to minimize PM stratification that may be created in these cases.</P>
            <P>8.3 How do I select the reference method measurement location and traverse points? You must follow EPA Method 1 for identifying manual reference method traverse points. Ideally, you should perform your manual reference method measurements at locations that satisfy the measurement site selection criteria specified in EPA Method 1 of at least eight duct diameters downstream and at least two duct diameters upstream of any flow disturbance. Where necessary, you may conduct testing at a location that is two diameters downstream and 0.5 diameters upstream of flow disturbances. If your location does not meet the minimum downstream and upstream requirements, you must obtain approval from us to test at your location.</P>
            <P>8.4 What are my pretest preparation steps? You must install your CEMS and prepare the reference method test site according to the specifications in sections 8.2 and 8.3.</P>
            <P>(1) After completing the initial field installation, we recommend that you operate your PM CEMS according to the manufacturer's instructions to familiarize yourself with its operation before you begin correlation testing.</P>
            <P>(i) During this initial period of operation, we recommend that you conduct daily checks (zero and upscale drift and sample volume, as appropriate), and, when any check exceeds the daily specification (see section 13.1), make adjustments and perform any necessary maintenance to ensure reliable operation.</P>
            <P>(2) When you are confident that your PM CEMS is operating properly, we recommend that you operate your CEMS over a correlation test planning period of sufficient duration to identify the full range of operating conditions and PM emissions to be used in your PM CEMS correlation test.</P>
            <P>(i) During the correlation test planning period, you should operate the process and air pollution control equipment over the normal range of operating conditions, except when you attempt to produce higher emissions.</P>
            <P>(ii) Your data recorder should record PM CEMS response during the full range of routine process operating conditions.</P>

            <P>(iii) You should try to establish the relationships between operating conditions and PM CEMS response, especially those conditions that produce the highest PM CEMS response over 15-minute averaging periods, and <PRTPAGE P="723"/>the lowest PM CEMS response as well. The objective is to be able to reproduce the conditions for purposes of the actual correlation testing discussed in section 8.6.</P>
            <P>(3) You must set the response range of your PM CEMS such that the instrument measures the full range of responses that correspond to the range of source operating conditions that you will implement during correlation testing.</P>
            <P>(4) We recommend that you perform preliminary reference method testing after the correlation test planning period. During this preliminary testing, you should measure the PM emission concentration corresponding to the highest PM CEMS response observed during the full range of normal operation, when perturbing the control equipment, or as the result of PM spiking.</P>
            <P>(5) Before performing correlation testing, you must perform a 7-day zero and upscale drift test (see section 8.5).</P>
            <P>(6) You must not change the response range of the monitor once the response range has been set and the drift test successfully completed.</P>
            <P>8.5 How do I perform the 7-day drift test? You must check the zero (or low-level value between 0 and 20 percent of the response range of the instrument) and upscale (between 50 and 100 percent of the instrument's response range) drift. You must perform this check at least once daily over 7 consecutive days. Your PM CEMS must quantify and record the zero and upscale measurements and the time of the measurements. If you make automatic or manual adjustments to your PM CEMS zero and upscale settings, you must conduct the drift test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that you can determine the amount of drift. You will find the calculation procedures for drift in section 12.1 and the acceptance criteria for allowable drift in section 13.1.</P>
            <P>(1) What is the purpose of 7-day drift tests? The purpose of the 7-day drift test is to demonstrate that your system is capable of operating in a stable manner and maintaining its calibration for at least a 7-day period.</P>
            <P>(2) How do I conduct the 7-day drift test? To conduct the 7-day drift test, you must determine the magnitude of the drift once each day, at 24-hour intervals, for 7 consecutive days while your source is operating normally.</P>
            <P>(i) You must conduct the 7-day drift test at the two points specified in section 8.5. You may perform the 7-day drift tests automatically or manually by introducing to your PM CEMS suitable reference standards (these need not be certified) or by using other appropriate procedures.</P>
            <P>(ii) You must record your PM CEMS zero and upscale response and evaluate them against the zero check value and upscale check value.</P>
            <P>(3) When must I conduct the 7-day drift test? You must complete a valid 7-day drift test before attempting the correlation test.</P>
            <P>8.6 How do I conduct my PM CEMS correlation test? You must conduct the correlation test according to the procedure given in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section. If you need multiple correlations, you must conduct testing and collect at least 15 sets of reference method and PM CEMS data for calculating each separate correlation.</P>

            <P>(1) You must use the reference method for PM (usually EPA Methods 5, 5I, or 17) that is prescribed by the applicable regulations. You may need to perform other reference methods or performance specifications (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Method 3 for oxygen, Method 4 for moisture, etc.) depending on the units in which your PM CEMS reports PM concentration.</P>
            <P>(i) We recommend that you use paired reference method trains when collecting manual PM data to identify and screen the reference method data for imprecision and bias. Procedures for checking reference method data for bias and precision can be found in the PM CEMS Knowledge Document (see section 16.5).</P>

            <P>(ii) You may use test runs that are shorter than 60 minutes in duration (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 20 or 30 minutes). You may perform your PM CEMS correlation tests during new source performance standards performance tests or other compliance tests subject to the Clean Air Act or other statutes, such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In these cases, your reference method results obtained during the PM CEMS correlation test may be used to determine compliance so long as your source and the test conditions and procedures (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> reference method sample run durations) are consistent with the applicable regulations and the reference method.</P>

            <P>(iii) You must convert the reference method results to units consistent with the conditions of your PM CEMS measurements. For example, if your PM CEMS measures and reports PM emissions in the units of mass per actual volume of stack gas, you must convert your reference method results to those units (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mg/acm). If your PM CEMS extracts and heats the sample gas to eliminate water droplets, then measures and reports PM emissions under those actual conditions, you must convert your reference method results to those same conditions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mg/acm at 160 °C).</P>

            <P>(2) During each test run, you must coordinate process operations, reference method sampling, and PM CEMS operations. For example, you must ensure that the process is operating at the targeted conditions, both reference method trains are sampling simultaneously (if paired sampling trains are being used), and your PM CEMS and data logger are operating properly.<PRTPAGE P="724"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) You must coordinate the start and stop times of each run between the reference method sampling and PM CEMS operation. For a batch sampling PM CEMS, you must start the reference method at the same time as your PM CEMS sampling.</P>
            <P>(ii) You must note the times for port changes (and other periods when the reference method sampling may be suspended) on the data sheets so that you can adjust your PM CEMS data accordingly, if necessary.</P>
            <P>(iii) You must properly align the time periods for your PM CEMS and your reference method measurements to account for your PM CEMS response time.</P>
            <P>(3) You must conduct a minimum of 15 valid runs each consisting of simultaneous PM CEMS and reference method measurement sets.</P>
            <P>(i) You may conduct more than 15 sets of CEMS and reference method measurements. If you choose this option, you may reject certain test results so long as the total number of valid test results you use to determine the correlation is greater than or equal to 15.</P>
            <P>(ii) You must report all data, including the rejected data.</P>
            <P>(iii) You may reject the results of up to five test runs without explanation.</P>
            <P>(iv) If you reject the results of more than five test runs, the basis for rejecting the results of the additional test runs must be explicitly stated in the reference method, this performance specification, Procedure 2 of appendix F, or your quality assurance plan.</P>
            <P>(4) Simultaneous PM CEMS and reference method measurements must be performed in a manner to ensure that the range of data that will be used to establish the correlation for your PM CEMS is maximized. You must first attempt to maximize your correlation range by following the procedures described in paragraphs (4)(i) through (iv) of this section. If you cannot obtain the three levels as described in paragraphs (i) through (iv), then you must use the procedure described in section 8.6(5).</P>
            <P>(i) You must attempt to obtain the three different levels of PM mass concentration by varying process operating conditions, varying PM control device conditions, or by means of PM spiking.</P>
            <P>(ii) The three PM concentration levels you use in the correlation tests must be distributed over the complete operating range experienced by your source.</P>
            <P>(iii) At least 20 percent of the minimum 15 measured data points you use should be contained in each of the following levels:</P>
            <P>• Level 1: From no PM (zero concentration) emissions to 50 percent of the maximum PM concentration;</P>
            <P>• Level 2: 25 to 75 percent of the maximum PM concentration; and</P>
            <P>• Level 3: 50 to 100 percent of the maximum PM concentration.</P>
            <P>(iv) Although the above levels overlap, you may only apply individual run data to one level.</P>
            <P>(5) If you cannot obtain three distinct levels of PM concentration as described, you must perform correlation testing over the maximum range of PM concentrations that is practical for your PM CEMS. To ensure that the range of data used to establish the correlation for your PM CEMS is maximized, you must follow one or more of the steps in paragraphs (5)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) Zero point data for <E T="03">in-situ</E> instruments should be obtained, to the extent possible, by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.</P>
            <P>(ii) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.</P>

            <P>(iii) Zero point data also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas).</P>

            <P>(iv) If none of the steps in paragraphs (5)(i) through (iii) of this section are possible, you must estimate the monitor response when no PM is in the flue gas (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 4 mA = 0 mg/acm).</P>
            <P>8.7 What do I do with the initial correlation test data for my PM CEMS? You must calculate and report the results of the correlation testing, including the correlation coefficient, confidence interval, and tolerance interval for the PM CEMS response and reference method correlation data that are use to establish the correlation, as specified in section 12. You must include all data sheets, calculations, charts (records of PM CEMS responses), process data records including PM control equipment operating parameters, and reference media certifications necessary to confirm that your PM CEMS met the requirements of this performance specification. In addition, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine the integrated (arithmetic average) PM CEMS output over each reference method test period;</P>
            <P>(2) Adjust your PM CEMS outputs and reference method test data to the same clock time (considering response time of your PM CEMS);</P>
            <P>(3) Confirm that the reference method results are consistent with your PM CEMS response in terms of, where applicable, moisture, temperature, pressure, and diluent concentrations; and</P>
            <P>(4) Determine whether any of the reference method test results do not meet the test method criteria.</P>

            <P>8.8 What is the limitation on the range of my PM CEMS correlation? Although the data you collect during the correlation testing should be representative of the full range of normal operating conditions at your <PRTPAGE P="725"/>source, you must conduct additional correlation testing if either of the conditions specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section occurs.</P>
            <P>(1) If your source is a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, you must conduct additional correlation testing if either of the events specified in paragraphs (1)(i) or (ii) of this section occurs while your source is operating under normal conditions.</P>

            <P>(i) Your source generates 24 consecutive hourly average PM CEMS responses that are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mA reading) used for the correlation curve or are greater than the PM CEMS response that corresponds to 50 percent of the emission limit, whichever is greater, or</P>
            <P>(ii) The cumulative hourly average PM CEMS responses generated by your source are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used for the correlation curve or are greater than the PM CEMS response that corresponds to 50 percent of the emission limit, whichever is greater, for more than 5 percent of your PM CEMS operating hours for the previous 30-day period.</P>
            <P>(2) If your source is not a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, you must conduct additional correlation testing if either of the events specified in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this section occurs while your source is operating under normal conditions.</P>

            <P>(i) Your source generates 24 consecutive hourly average PM CEMS responses that are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mA reading) used for the correlation curve, or</P>
            <P>(ii) The cumulative hourly average PM CEMS responses generated by your source are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used for the correlation curve for more than 5 percent of your PM CEMS operating hours for the previous 30-day period.</P>
            <P>(3) If additional correlation testing is required, you must conduct at least three additional test runs under the conditions that caused the higher PM CEMS response.</P>
            <P>(i) You must complete the additional testing and use the resulting new data along with the previous data to calculate a revised correlation equation within 60 days after the occurrence of the event that requires additional testing, as specified in paragraphs 8.8(1) and (2).</P>
            <P>(4) If your source generates consecutive PM CEMS hourly responses that are greater than 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used to develop the correlation curve for 24 hours or for a cumulative period that amounts to more than 5 percent of the PM CEMS operating hours for the previous 30-day period, you must report the reason for the higher PM CEMS responses.</P>

            <P>12.2 How do I perform the regression analysis? You must couple each reference method PM concentration measurement, y, in the appropriate units, with an average PM CEMS response, x, over corresponding time periods. You must complete your PM CEMS correlation calculations using data deemed acceptable by quality control procedures identified in 40 CFR 60, Appendix F, Procedure 2.</P>
            <P>(1) You must evaluate all flagged or suspect data produced during measurement periods and determine whether they should be excluded from your PM CEMS's average.</P>
            <P>(2) You must assure that the reference method and PM CEMS results are on a consistent moisture, temperature, and diluent basis. You must convert the reference method PM concentration measurements (dry standard conditions) to the units of your PM CEMS measurement conditions. The conditions of your PM CEMS measurement are monitor-specific. You must obtain from your PM CEMS vendor or instrument manufacturer the conditions and units of measurement for your PM CEMS.</P>

            <P>(i) If your sample gas contains entrained water droplets and your PM CEMS is an extractive system that measures at actual conditions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> wet basis), you must use the measured moisture content determined from the impinger analysis when converting your reference method PM data to PM CEMS conditions; do not use the moisture content calculated from a psychrometric chart based on saturated conditions.</P>
            <P>12.3 How do I determine my PM CEMS correlation? To predict PM concentrations from PM CEMS responses, you must use the calculation method of least squares presented in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section. When performing the calculations, each reference method PM concentration measurement must be treated as a discrete data point; if using paired sampling trains, do not average reference method data pairs for any test run.</P>
            <P>This performance specification describes procedures for evaluating five types of correlation models: linear, polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, and power. Procedures for selecting the most appropriate correlation model are presented in section 12.4 of this specification.</P>
            <P>(1) How do I evaluate a linear correlation for my correlation test data? To evaluate a linear correlation, follow the procedures described in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>

              <E T="03">Note:</E> PS-11 does not address the application of correlation equations to calculate PM emission concentrations using PM CEMS response data during normal operations of a PM CEMS. However, we will provide guidance on the use of specific correlation models (i.e., logarithmic, exponential, and power models) to calculate PM concentrations in an operating PM CEMS in situations when the PM CEMS response values are equal to or less than zero, and the correlation model is undefined.</P>
            <P>12.4 Which correlation model should I use? Follow the procedures described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this section to determine which correlation model you should use.</P>
            <P>(1) For each correlation model that you develop using the procedures described in section 12.3 of this specification, compare the confidence interval half range percentage, tolerance interval half range percentage, and correlation coefficient to the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification. You can use the linear, logarithmic, exponential, or power correlation model if the model satisfies all of the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification. However, to use the polynomial model you first must check that the polynomial correlation curve satisfies the criteria for minimum and maximum values specified in paragraph (3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If you develop more than one correlation curve that satisfy the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification, you should use the correlation curve with the greatest correlation coefficient. If the polynomial model has the greatest correlation coefficient, you first must check that the polynomial correlation curve satisfies the criteria for minimum and maximum values specified in paragraph (3) of this section.</P>

            <P>(3) You can use the polynomial model that you develop using the procedures described in section 12.3(2) if the model satisfies the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification, and the minimum or maximum value of the polynomial correlation curve does not occur within the expanded data range. The minimum or maximum value of the polynomial correlation <PRTPAGE P="732"/>curve is the point where the slope of the curve equals zero. To determine if the minimum or maximum value occurs within the expanded data range, follow the procedure described in paragraphs (3)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>

            <P>(i) Determine if your polynomial correlation curve has a minimum or maximum point by comparing the polynomial coefficient b<E T="52">2</E> to zero. If b<E T="52">2</E> is less than zero, the curve has a maximum value. If b<E T="52">2</E> is greater than zero, the curve has a minimum value. (Note: If b<E T="52">2</E> equals zero, the correlation curve is linear.)</P>
            <P>(ii) Calculate the minimum value using Equation 11-48.</P>

              <GID>ER25MR09.106</GID>
            </GPH>
            <P>(iii) If your polynomial correlation curve has a minimum point, you must compare the minimum value to the minimum PM CEMS response used to develop the correlation curve. If the correlation curve minimum value is less than or equal to the minimum PM CEMS response value, you can use the polynomial correlation curve, provided the correlation curve also satisfies all of the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification. If the correlation curve minimum value is greater than the minimum PM CEMS response value, you cannot use the polynomial correlation curve to predict PM concentrations.</P>
            <P>(iv) If your polynomial correlation curve has a maximum, the maximum value must be greater than the allowable extrapolation limit. If your source is not a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, the allowable extrapolation limit is 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used to develop the correlation curve. If your source is a low-emitting source, the allowable extrapolation limit is 125 percent of the highest PM CEMS response used to develop the correlation curve or the PM CEMS response that corresponds to 50 percent of the emission limit, whichever is greater. If the polynomial correlation curve maximum value is greater than the extrapolation limit, and the correlation curve satisfies all of the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification, you can use the polynomial correlation curve to predict PM concentrations. If the correlation curve maximum value is less than the extrapolation limit, you cannot use the polynomial correlation curve to predict PM concentrations.</P>
            <P>(4) You may petition the Administrator for alternative solutions or sampling recommendations if the correlation models described in section 12.3 of this specification do not satisfy the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of this specification.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">13.0 What Are the Performance Criteria for My PM CEMS?</HD>
            <P>You must evaluate your PM CEMS based on the 7-day drift check, the accuracy of the correlation, and the sampling periods and cycle/response time.</P>
            <P>13.1 What is the 7-day drift check performance specification? Your daily PM CEMS internal drift checks must demonstrate that the daily drift of your PM CEMS does not deviate from the value of the reference light, optical filter, Beta attenuation signal, or other technology-suitable reference standard by more than 2 percent of the response range. If your CEMS includes diluent and/or auxiliary monitors (for temperature, pressure, and/or moisture) that are employed as a necessary part of this performance specification, you must determine the calibration drift separately for each ancillary monitor in terms of its respective output (see the appropriate performance specification for the diluent CEMS specification). None of the calibration drifts may exceed their individual specification.</P>

            <P>13.2 What performance criteria must my PM CEMS correlation satisfy? Your PM CEMS correlation must meet each of the minimum specifications in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this section. Before confidence and tolerance interval half range percentage calculations are made, you must convert the emission limit to the appropriate units of your PM CEMS measurement conditions using the average of emissions gas property values (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> diluent concentration, temperature, pressure, and moisture) measured during the correlation test.</P>
            <P>(1) The correlation coefficient must satisfy the criterion specified in paragraph (1)(i) or (ii), whichever applies.</P>
            <P>(i) If your source is not a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, the correlation coefficient (r) must be greater than or equal to 0.85.</P>
            <P>(ii) If your source is a low-emitting source, as defined in section 3.16 of this specification, the correlation coefficient (r) must be greater than or equal to 0.75.</P>
            <P>(2) The confidence interval half range must satisfy the applicable criterion specified in paragraph (2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, based on the type of correlation model.</P>
            <P>(i) For linear or logarithmic correlations, the 95 percent confidence interval half range at the mean PM CEMS response value from the correlation test must be within 10 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the CI% calculated using Equation 11-10 must be less than or equal to 10 percent.</P>

            <P>(ii) For polynomial correlations, the 95 percent confidence interval half range at the PM CEMS response value from the correlation test that corresponds to the minimum value for Δ must be within 10 percent of the <PRTPAGE P="733"/>PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the CI% calculated using Equation 11-28 must be less than or equal to 10 percent.</P>
            <P>(iii) For exponential or power correlations, the 95 percent confidence interval half range at the mean of the logarithm of the PM CEMS response values from the correlation test must be within 10 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the CI% calculated using Equation 11-10 must be less than or equal to 10 percent.</P>
            <P>(3) The tolerance interval half range must satisfy the applicable criterion specified in paragraph (3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, based on the type of correlation model.</P>
            <P>(i) For linear or logarithmic correlations, the half range tolerance interval with 95 percent confidence and 75 percent coverage at the mean PM CEMS response value from the correlation test must be within 25 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the TI% calculated using Equation 11-13 must be less than or equal to 25 percent.</P>
            <P>(ii) For polynomial correlations, the half range tolerance interval with 95 percent confidence and 75 percent coverage at the PM CEMS response value from the correlation test that corresponds to the minimum value for Δ must be within 25 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the TI% calculated using Equation 11-32 must be less than or equal to 25 percent.</P>
            <P>(iii) For exponential or power correlations, the half range tolerance interval with 95 percent confidence and 75 percent coverage at the mean of the logarithm of the PM CEMS response values from the correlation test must be within 25 percent of the PM emission limit value specified in the applicable regulation. Therefore, the TI% calculated using Equation 11-13 must be less than or equal to 25 percent.</P>
            <P>13.3 What are the sampling periods and cycle/response time? You must document and maintain the response time and any changes in the response time following installation.</P>
            <P>(1) If you have a batch sampling PM CEMS, you must evaluate the limits presented in paragraphs (1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) The response time of your PM CEMS, which is equivalent to the cycle time, must be no longer than 15 minutes. In addition, the delay between the end of the sampling time and reporting of the sample analysis must be no greater than 3 minutes. You must document any changes in the response time following installation.</P>
            <P>(ii) The sampling time of your PM CEMS must be no less than 30 percent of the cycle time. If you have a batch sampling PM CEMS, sampling must be continuous except during pauses when the collected pollutant on the capture media is being analyzed and the next capture medium starts collecting a new sample.</P>

            <P>13.4 What PM compliance monitoring must I do? You must report your CEMS measurements in the units of the standard expressed in the regulations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mg/dscm @ 7 percent oxygen, pounds per million Btu (lb/mmBtu), etc.). You may need to install auxiliary data monitoring equipment to convert the units reported by your PM CEMS into units of the PM emission standard.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>

            <P>1.1 Analyte. The analyte measured by these procedures and specifications is total vapor phase mercury (Hg) in the flue gas, which represents the sum of elemental Hg (Hg°, CAS Number 7439-97-6) and oxidized forms of gaseous Hg (Hg<E T="51">+2</E>), in concentration units of micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<SU>3</SU>).</P>
            <P>1.2 Applicability.</P>
            <P>1.2.1 This specification is for evaluating the acceptability of total vapor phase Hg continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) installed at stationary sources at the time of or soon after installation and whenever specified in the regulations. The Hg CEMS must be capable of measuring the total concentration in µg/m<SU>3</SU> of vapor phase Hg, regardless of speciation, and recording that concentration at standard conditions on a wet or dry basis. These specifications do not address measurement of particle bound Hg.</P>

            <P>1.2.2 This specification is not designed to evaluate an installed CEMS's performance over an extended period of time nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and auxiliary procedures to assess the CEMS's performance. The source owner or operator, however, is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly. The Administrator may require, under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, the operator to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial performance evaluation test. <E T="03">See</E> §§ 60.13(c) and 63.8(e)(1).</P>
            <P>1.2.3 Mercury monitoring approaches not entirely suited to these specifications may be approvable under the alternative monitoring or alternative test method provisions of § 60.13(i) and § 63.8(f) or § 60.8(b)(3) and § 63.7(f), respectively.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Performance Specification</HD>
            <P>Procedures for determining CEMS relative accuracy, linearity, and calibration drift are outlined. CEMS installation and measurement location specifications, data reduction procedures, and performance criteria are included.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions</HD>
            <P>3.1 <E T="03">Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS)</E> means the total equipment required to measure a pollutant concentration. The system generally consists of the following three major subsystems:</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Sample Interface</E> means that portion of the CEMS used for one or more of the following: sample acquisition, sample transport, sample conditioning, and protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack effluent.<PRTPAGE P="736"/>
            </P>
            <P>3.3 <E T="03">Hg Analyzer</E> means that portion of the Hg CEMS that measures the total vapor phase Hg mass concentration and generates a proportional output.</P>
            <P>3.4 <E T="03">Data Recorder</E> means that portion of the CEMS that provides a permanent electronic record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may provide automatic data reduction and CEMS control capabilities.</P>
            <P>3.5 <E T="03">Span Value</E> means the measurement range as specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement. If the span is not specified in the applicable regulation or other requirement, then it must be a value approximately equivalent to two times the emission standard. Unless otherwise specified, the span value may be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.</P>
            <P>3.6 <E T="03">Measurement Error Test</E> means a test procedure in which the accuracy of the concentrations measured by a CEMS at three or more points over its measurement range is evaluated using reference gases. For Hg CEMS, elemental and oxidized Hg (Hg<SU>0</SU> and mercuric chloride, HgCl<E T="52">2</E>) gas standards of known concentration are used for this procedure.</P>
            <P>3.7 <E T="03">Measurement Error (ME)</E> means the absolute value of the difference between the concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration of a reference gas, expressed as a percentage of the span value, when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface, is challenged.</P>
            <P>3.8 <E T="03">Calibration Drift (CD)</E> means the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS output response and either an upscale Hg reference gas or a zero-level Hg reference gas, expressed as a percentage of the span value, when the entire CEMS, including the sampling interface, is challenged after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance or repair took place.</P>
            <P>3.9 <E T="03">Relative Accuracy Test Procedure</E> means a test procedure consisting of at least nine test runs, in which the accuracy of the concentrations measured by a CEMS is evaluated by comparison against concurrent measurements made with a reference method (RM). Relative accuracy tests repeated on a regular, on-going basis are referred to as relative accuracy test audits or RATAs.</P>
            <P>3.10 <E T="03">Relative Accuracy (RA)</E> means the absolute mean difference between the pollutant concentrations determined by the CEMS and the values determined by the RM plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests. Alternatively, for sources with an average RM concentration less than 5.0 micrograms per standard cubic meter (µg/scm), the RA may be expressed as the absolute value of the difference between the mean CEMS and RM values.</P>

            <P>The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS user's manual and materials recommended by the RM should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>6.1 CEMS Equipment Specifications.</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Data Recorder Scale. The Hg CEMS data recorder output range must include the full range of expected Hg concentration values in the gas stream to be sampled including zero and the span value.</P>

            <P>6.1.2 The Hg CEMS design should also provide for the determination of CD and ME at a zero value (zero to 20 percent of the span value) and at upscale values (between 50 and 100 percent of the span value). The Hg CEMS must be constructed to permit the introduction of known concentrations of Hg and HgCl<E T="52">2</E> separately into the sampling system of the CEMS immediately preceding the sample extraction filtration system such that the entire CEMS can be challenged.</P>
            <P>6.2 Reference Gas Delivery System. The reference gas delivery system must be designed so that the flowrate exceeds the sampling system flow requirements of the CEMS and that the gas is delivered to the CEMS at atmospheric pressure.</P>

            <P>6.3 Other equipment and supplies, as needed by the reference method used for the Relative Accuracy Test Procedure. <E T="03">See</E> section 8.6.2.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>

            <P>7.1 Reference Gases. Reference gas standards are required for both elemental and oxidized Hg (Hg and mercuric chloride, HgCl<E T="52">2</E>). The use of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable standards and reagents is required. The following gas concentrations are required.</P>
            <P>7.1.1 Zero-level. 0 to 20 percent of the span value.</P>
            <P>7.1.2 Mid-level. 50 to 60 percent of the span value.</P>
            <P>7.1.3 High-level. 80 to 100 percent of the span value.</P>

            <P>7.2 Reference gas standards may also be required for the reference methods. <E T="03">See</E> section 8.6.2.<PRTPAGE P="737"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Performance Specification Test Procedure</HD>
            <P>8.1 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 CEMS Installation. Install the CEMS at an accessible location downstream of all pollution control equipment. Place the probe outlet or other sampling interface at a point or location in the stack (or vent) representative of the stack gas concentration of Hg. Since the Hg CEMS sample system normally extracts gas from a single point in the stack, a location that has been shown to be free of stratification for Hg or, alternatively, SO<E T="52">2</E> is recommended. If the cause of failure to meet the RA test requirement is determined to be the measurement location and a satisfactory correction technique cannot be established, the Administrator may require the CEMS to be relocated. Measurement locations and points or paths that are most likely to provide data that will meet the RA requirements are described in sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 below.</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Measurement Location. The measurement location should be (1) at least two equivalent diameters downstream of the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation or other point at which a change of pollutant concentration may occur, and (2) at least half an equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated according to Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Hg CEMS Sample Extraction Point. Use a sample extraction point either (1) no less than 1.0 meter from the stack or duct wall, or (2) within the centroidal velocity traverse area of the stack or duct cross section. This does not apply to cross-stack, in-situ measurement systems.</P>

            <P>8.2 Measurement Error (ME) Test Procedure. Sequentially inject each of at least three elemental Hg reference gases (zero, mid-level, and high level, as defined in section 7.1), three times each for a total of nine injections. Inject the gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession. At each reference gas concentration, determine the average of the three CEMS responses and subtract the average response from the reference gas value. Calculate the measurement error (ME) using Equation 12-1 by expressing the absolute value of the difference between the average CEMS response (A) and the reference gas value (R) as a percentage of the span (<E T="03">see</E> example data sheet in Figure 12A-1). For each elemental Hg reference gas, the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS response and the reference value must not exceed 5 percent of the span value. If this specification is not met, identify and correct the problem before proceeding. Repeat the measurement error test procedure using oxidized Hg reference gases. For each oxidized Hg reference gas, the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS response and the reference value shall not exceed 10 percent of the span value. If this specification is not met, identify and correct the problem before proceeding.</P>

            <P>8.3 Seven-Day Calibration Drift (CD) Test Procedure.</P>

            <P>8.3.1 CD Test Period. While the affected facility is operating normally, or as specified in an applicable regulation, determine the magnitude of the CD once each day (at 24-hour intervals, to the extent practicable) for 7 consecutive unit operating days according to the procedures in sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3. The 7 consecutive unit operating days need not be 7 consecutive calendar days. Use either Hg° or HgCl<E T="52">2</E> standards for this test.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 The purpose of the CD measurement is to verify the ability of the CEMS to conform to the established CEMS response used for determining emission concentrations or emission rates. Therefore, if periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and upscale response settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined.</P>

            <P>8.3.3 Conduct the CD test using the zero gas specified and either the mid-level or high-level gas as specified in section 7.1. Sequentially introduce the reference gases to the CEMS at the sampling system of the CEMS immediately preceding the sample extraction filtration system. Record the CEMS response (A) for each reference gas and, using Equation 12A-2, subtract the corresponding reference value (R) from the CEMS value, and express the absolute value of the difference as a percentage of the span value (<E T="03">see also</E> example data sheet in Figure 12A-2). For each reference gas, the absolute value of the difference between the CEMS response and the reference value must not exceed 5 percent of the span value. If these specifications are not met, identify and correct the problem before proceeding.</P>

            <P>8.4 Relative Accuracy (RA) Test Procedure.</P>
            <P>8.4.1 RA Test Period. Conduct the RA test according to the procedure given in sections 8.4.2 through 8.4.6 while the affected facility is operating normally, or as specified in an applicable subpart. The RA test may be conducted during the CD test period.</P>

            <P>8.4.2 Reference Methods (RM). Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations, use Method 29, Method 30A, or Method 30B in appendix A-8 to this part or American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Method D6784-02 (incorporated by reference, <E T="03">see</E> § 60.17) as the RM for Hg concentration. For Method 29 and ASTM Method D6784-02 only, the filterable portion of the sample need not be included when making comparisons to the CEMS results. When Method 29, Method 30B, or ASTM D6784-02 is used, conduct the RM test runs with paired or duplicate sampling systems and use the average of the vapor phase Hg concentrations measured by the two trains. When Method 30A is used, paired sampling systems are not required. If the RM and CEMS measure on a different moisture basis, data derived with Method 4 in appendix A-3 to this part must also be obtained during the RA test.</P>
            <P>8.4.3 Sampling Strategy for RM Tests. Conduct the RM tests in such a way that they will yield results representative of the emissions from the source and can be compared to the CEMS data. The RM and CEMS locations need not be immediately adjacent. Locate the RM measurement points in accordance with section 8.1.3 of Performance Specification 2 (PS 2) in this appendix. It is preferable to conduct moisture measurements (if needed) and Hg measurements simultaneously, although moisture measurements that are taken within an hour of the Hg measurements may be used to adjust the Hg concentrations to a consistent moisture basis. In order to correlate the CEMS and RM data properly, note the beginning and end of each RM test period for each paired RM run (including the exact time of day) on the CEMS chart recordings or other permanent record of output.</P>
            <P>8.4.4 Number and Length of RM Test Runs. Conduct a minimum of nine RM test runs. When Method 29, Method 30B, or ASTM D6784-02 is used, only test runs for which the paired RM trains meet the relative deviation criteria (RD) of this PS must be used in the RA calculations. In addition, for Method 29 and ASTM D6784-02, use a minimum sample time of 2 hours and for Methods 30A and 30B use a minimum sample time of 30 minutes.</P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>More than nine sets of RM test runs may be performed. If this option is chosen, RM test run results may be excluded so long as the total number of RM test run results used to determine the CEMS RA is greater than or equal to nine. However, all data must be reported including the excluded test run data.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <P>8.4.5 Correlation of RM and CEMS Data. Correlate the CEMS and the RM test data as to the time and duration by first determining from the CEMS final output (the one used for reporting) the integrated average pollutant concentration for each RM test period. Consider system response time, if important, and confirm that the results are on a consistent moisture basis with the RM test. Then, compare each integrated CEMS value against the corresponding RM value. When Method 29, Method 30B, or ASTM D6784-02 is used, compare each CEMS value against the corresponding average of the paired RM values.</P>
            <P>8.4.6 Paired RM Outliers.</P>
            <P>8.4.6.1 When Method 29, Method 30B, or ASTM D6784-02 is used, outliers are identified through the determination of relative deviation (RD) of the paired RM tests. Data that do not meet the RD criteria must be flagged as a data quality problem and may not be used in the calculation of RA. The primary reason for performing paired RM sampling is to ensure the quality of the RM data. The percent RD of paired data is the parameter used to quantify data quality. Determine RD for paired data points as follows:</P>

            <PRTPAGE P="739"/>
            <P>8.4.6.2 The minimum performance criteria for RM Hg data is that RD for any data pair must be ≤10 percent as long as the mean Hg concentration is greater than 1.0 µg/m<SU>3</SU>. If the mean Hg concentration is less than or equal to 1.0 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, the RD must be ≤20 percent or ≤0.2 µg/m<SU>3</SU> absolute difference. Pairs of RM data exceeding these RD criteria should be eliminated from the data set used to develop a Hg CEMS correlation or to assess CEMS RA.</P>
            <P>8.4.7 Calculate the mean difference between the RM and CEMS values in the units of micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<SU>3</SU>), the standard deviation, the confidence coefficient, and the RA according to the procedures in section 12.0.</P>
            <P>8.5 Reporting. At a minimum (check with the appropriate EPA Regional Office, State or local Agency for additional requirements, if any), summarize in tabular form the results of the CD tests, the linearity tests, and the RA test or alternative RA procedure, as appropriate. Include all data sheets, calculations, charts (records of CEMS responses), reference gas concentration certifications, and any other information necessary to confirm that the CEMS meets the performance criteria.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Performance Specification 12B—Specifications and Test Procedures for Monitoring Total Vapor Phase Mercury Emissions From Stationary Sources Using a Sorbent Trap Monitoring System</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <P>The purpose of Performance Specification 12B (PS 12B) is to establish performance benchmarks for, and to evaluate the acceptability of, sorbent trap monitoring systems used to monitor total vapor-phase mercury (Hg) emissions in stationary source flue gas streams. These monitoring systems involve continuous repetitive in-stack sampling using paired sorbent media traps with periodic analysis of the time-integrated samples. Persons using PS 12B should have a thorough working knowledge of Methods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 30B in appendices A-1 through A-3 and A-8 to this part.</P>

            <P>1.1 Analyte. The analyte measured by these procedures and specifications is total vapor phase Hg in the flue gas, which represents the sum of elemental Hg (Hg<SU>0</SU>, CAS Number 7439-97-6) and gaseous forms of oxidized Hg (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Hg<E T="51">+2</E>) in mass concentration units of micrograms per dry standard cubic meter (µg/dscm).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.2 Applicability</HD>
            <P>1.2.1 These procedures are only intended for use under relatively low particulate conditions (e.g., monitoring after all pollution control devices). This specification is for evaluating the acceptability of total vapor phase Hg sorbent trap monitoring systems installed at stationary sources at the time of, or soon after, installation and whenever specified in the regulations. The Hg monitoring system must be capable of measuring the total concentration of vapor phase Hg (regardless of speciation), in units of µg/dscm.</P>

            <P>1.2.2 This specification contains routine procedures and specifications designed to evaluate an installed sorbent trap monitoring system's performance over time; Procedure 5 of appendix F to this part contains additional procedures and specifications which may be required for long term operation. In addition, the source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the monitoring system properly. The Administrator may require the owner or operator, under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, to conduct performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate the CEMS performance. <E T="03">See</E> § 60.13(c) and 63.8(e)(1).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Principle</HD>
            <P>Known volumes of flue gas are continuously extracted from a stack or duct through paired, in-stack, pre-spiked sorbent media traps at appropriate nominal flow rates. The sorbent traps in the sampling system are periodically exchanged with new ones, prepared for analysis as needed, and analyzed by any technique that can meet the performance criteria. For quality-assurance purposes, a section of each sorbent trap is spiked with Hg<SU>0</SU> prior to sampling. Following sampling, this section is analyzed separately and a specified minimum percentage of the spike must be recovered. Paired train sampling is required to determine method precision.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions</HD>
            <P>3.1 <E T="03">Sorbent Trap Monitoring System</E> means the total equipment required for the collection of gaseous Hg samples using paired three-partition sorbent traps.</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Relative Accuracy Test Procedure</E> means a test procedure consisting of at least nine runs, in which the accuracy of the total vapor phase Hg concentrations measured by the sorbent trap monitoring system is evaluated by comparison against concurrent measurements made with a reference method (RM). Relative accuracy tests repeated on a regular, on-going basis are referred to as relative accuracy test audits or RATAs.</P>
            <P>3.3 <E T="03">Relative Accuracy (RA)</E> means the absolute mean difference between the pollutant (Hg) concentrations determined by the sorbent trap monitoring system and the values determined by the reference method (RM) plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests. Alternatively, for low concentration sources, the RA may be expressed as the absolute value of the difference between the mean sorbent trap monitoring system and RM values.</P>
            <P>3.4 <E T="03">Relative Deviation (RD)</E> means the absolute difference of the Hg concentration values obtained with a pair of sorbent traps divided by the sum of those concentrations, expressed as a percentage. RD is used to assess the precision of the sorbent trap monitoring system.</P>
            <P>3.5 <E T="03">Spike Recovery</E> means the mass of Hg recovered from the spiked trap section, expressed as a percentage of the amount spiked. Spike recovery is used to assess sample matrix interference.</P>

            <P>The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures.<PRTPAGE P="745"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>6.1 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System Equipment Specifications.</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Monitoring System. The equipment described in Method 30B in appendix A-8 to this part must be used to continuously sample for Hg emissions, with the substitution of three-section traps in place of two-section traps, as described below. A typical sorbent trap monitoring system is shown in Figure 12B-1.</P>
            <P>6.1.2 Three-Section Sorbent Traps. The sorbent media used to collect Hg must be configured in traps with three distinct and identical segments or sections, connected in series, to be separately analyzed. section 1 is designated for primary capture of gaseous Hg. section 2 is designated as a backup section for determination of vapor-phase Hg breakthrough. section 3 is designated for quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) purposes. section 3 must be spiked with a known amount of gaseous Hg<SU>0</SU> prior to sampling and later analyzed to determine the spike (and hence sample) recovery efficiency.</P>

            </GPH>

            <P>6.1.3 Gaseous Hg<SU>0</SU> Sorbent Trap Spiking System. A known mass of gaseous Hg<SU>0</SU> must be spiked onto section 3 of each sorbent trap prior to sampling. Any approach capable of quantitatively delivering known masses of Hg<SU>0</SU> onto sorbent traps is acceptable. Several technologies or devices are available to meet this objective. Their practicality is a function of Hg mass spike levels. For low levels, NIST-certified or NIST-traceable gas generators or tanks may be suitable, but will likely require long preparation times. A more practical, alternative system, capable of delivering almost any mass required, employs NIST-certified or NIST-traceable Hg salt solutions (e.g., Hg(NO<E T="52">3</E>)<E T="52">2</E>). With this system, an aliquot of known volume and concentration is added to a reaction vessel containing a reducing agent (e.g., stannous chloride); the Hg salt solution is reduced to Hg<SU>0</SU> and purged onto section 3 of the sorbent trap by using an impinger sparging system.<PRTPAGE P="746"/>
            </P>
            <P>6.1.4 Sample Analysis Equipment. Any analytical system capable of quantitatively recovering and quantifying total gaseous Hg from sorbent media is acceptable provided that the analysis can meet the performance criteria in Table 12B-1 in section 9 of this performance specification. Candidate recovery techniques include leaching, digestion, and thermal desorption. Candidate analytical techniques include ultraviolet atomic fluorescence (UV AF); ultraviolet atomic absorption (UV AA), with and without gold trapping; and in-situ X-ray fluorescence (XRF).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>

            <P>Only NIST-certified or NIST-traceable calibration gas standards and reagents must be used for the tests and procedures required under this performance specification. The sorbent media may be any collection material (e.g., carbon, chemically treated filter, <E T="03">etc.</E>) capable of quantitatively capturing and recovering for subsequent analysis, all gaseous forms of Hg in the emissions from the intended application. Selection of the sorbent media must be based on the material's ability to achieve the performance criteria contained in this method as well as the sorbent's vapor phase Hg capture efficiency for the emissions matrix and the expected sampling duration at the test site.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.0 Performance Specification Test Procedure</HD>
            <P>8.1 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 Selection of Monitoring Site. Sampling site information should be obtained in accordance with Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. Place the probe inlet at a point or location in the stack (or vent) downstream of all pollution control equipment and representative of the stack gas concentration of Hg. A location that has been shown to be free of stratification for Hg or, alternatively, SO<E T="52">2</E> is recommended. An estimation of the expected stack Hg concentration is required to establish a target sample flow rate, total gas sample volume, and the mass of Hg<SU>0</SU> to be spiked onto section 3 of each sorbent trap.</P>

            <P>8.1.2 Pre-sampling Spiking of Sorbent Traps. Based on the estimated Hg concentration in the stack, the target sample rate and the target sampling duration, calculate the expected mass loading for section 1 of each sorbent trap (<E T="03">see</E> section 12.1 of this performance specification). The pre-sampling spike to be added to section 3 of each sorbent trap must be within ±50 percent of the expected section 1 mass loading. Spike section 3 of each sorbent trap at this level, as described in section 6.1.3 of this performance specification. For each sorbent trap, keep a record of the mass of Hg<SU>0</SU> added to section 3. This record must include, at a minimum, the identification number of the trap, the date and time of the spike, the name of the analyst performing the procedure, the method of spiking, the mass of Hg <SU>0</SU> added to section 3 of the trap (µg), and the supporting calculations.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Pre-monitoring Leak Check. Perform a leak check with the sorbent traps in place in the sampling system. Draw a vacuum in each sample train. Adjust the vacuum in each sample train to ~15″ Hg. Use the gas flow meter to determine leak rate. The leakage rate must not exceed 4 percent of the target sampling rate. Once the leak check passes this criterion, carefully release the vacuum in the sample train, then seal the sorbent trap inlet until the probe is ready for insertion into the stack or duct.</P>

            <P>8.1.4 Determination of Flue Gas Characteristics. Determine or measure the flue gas measurement environment characteristics (gas temperature, static pressure, gas velocity, stack moisture, <E T="03">etc.</E>) in order to determine ancillary requirements such as probe heating requirements (if any), sampling rate, proportional sampling conditions, moisture management, <E T="03">etc.</E>
            </P>
            <P>8.2 Monitoring.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 System Preparation and Initial Data Recording. Remove the plug from the end of each sorbent trap and store each plug in a clean sorbent trap storage container. Remove the stack or duct port cap and insert the probe(s) with the inlet(s) aligned perpendicular to the stack gas flow. Secure the probe(s) and ensure that no leakage occurs between the duct and environment. Record initial data including the sorbent trap ID, start time, starting gas flow meter readings, initial temperatures, set points, and any other appropriate information.</P>

            <P>8.2.2 Flow Rate Control. Set the initial sample flow rate at the target value from section 8.1.1 of this performance specification. Then, for every operating hour during the sampling period, record the date and time, the sample flow rate, the gas flow meter reading, the stack temperature (if needed), the flow meter temperatures (if needed), temperatures of heated equipment such as the vacuum lines and the probes (if heated), and the sampling system vacuum readings. Also, record the stack gas flow rate and the ratio of the stack gas flow rate to the sample flow rate. Adjust the sampling flow rate to maintain proportional sampling, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> keep the ratio of the stack gas flow rate to sample flow rate within ±25 percent of the reference ratio from the first hour of the data collection period (<E T="03">see</E> section 12.2 of this performance specification). The sample flow rate through a sorbent trap monitoring system during any hour (or portion of an hour) that the unit is not operating must be zero.<PRTPAGE P="747"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.2.3 Stack Gas Moisture Determination. If data from the sorbent trap monitoring system will be used to calculate Hg mass emissions, determine the stack gas moisture content using a continuous moisture monitoring system or other means acceptable to the Administrator, such as the ones described in § 75.11(b) of this chapter. Alternatively, for combustion of coal, wood, or natural gas in boilers only, a default moisture percentage from § 75.11(b) of this chapter may be used.</P>
            <P>8.2.4 Essential Operating Data. Obtain and record any essential operating data for the facility during the test period, e.g., the barometric pressure for correcting the sample volume measured by a dry gas meter to standard conditions. At the end of the data collection period, record the final gas flow meter reading and the final values of all other essential parameters.</P>
            <P>8.2.5 Post-monitoring Leak Check. When the monitoring period is completed, turn off the sample pump, remove the probe/sorbent trap from the port and carefully re-plug the end of each sorbent trap. Perform a leak check with the sorbent traps in place, at the maximum vacuum reached during the monitoring period. Use the same general approach described in section 8.1.3 of this performance specification. Record the leakage rate and vacuum. The leakage rate must not exceed 4 percent of the average sampling rate for the monitoring period. Following the leak check, carefully release the vacuum in the sample train.</P>
            <P>8.2.6 Sample Recovery. Recover each sampled sorbent trap by removing it from the probe and seal both ends. Wipe any deposited material from the outside of the sorbent trap. Place the sorbent trap into an appropriate sample storage container and store/preserve it in an appropriate manner.</P>
            <P>8.2.7 Sample Preservation, Storage, and Transport. While the performance criteria of this approach provide for verification of appropriate sample handling, it is still important that the user consider, determine, and plan for suitable sample preservation, storage, transport, and holding times for these measurements. Therefore, procedures in recognized voluntary consensus standards such as those in ASTM D6911-03 “Standard Guide for Packaging and Shipping Environmental Samples for Laboratory Analysis” should be followed for all samples.</P>
            <P>8.2.8 Sample Custody. Proper procedures and documentation for sample chain of custody are critical to ensuring data integrity. Chain of custody procedures in recognized voluntary consensus standards such as those in ASTM D4840-99 “Standard Guide for Sample Chain-of-Custody Procedures” should be followed for all samples (including field samples and blanks).</P>
            <P>8.3 Relative Accuracy (RA) Test Procedure</P>
            <P>8.3.1 For the initial certification of a sorbent trap monitoring system, a RA Test is required. Follow the basic RA test procedures and calculation methodology described in sections 8.4.1 through 8.4.7 and 12.4 of PS 12A in this appendix, replacing the term “CEMS” with “sorbent trap monitoring system”.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Special Considerations. The type of sorbent material used in the traps must be the same as that used for daily operation of the monitoring system; however, the size of the traps used for the RA test may be smaller than the traps used for daily operation of the system. Spike the third section of each sorbent trap with elemental Hg, as described in section 8.1.2 of this performance specification. Install a new pair of sorbent traps prior to each test run. For each run, the sorbent trap data must be validated according to the quality assurance criteria in Table 12B-1 in section 9.0, below.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 Acceptance Criteria. The RA of the sorbent trap monitoring system must be no greater than 20 percent of the mean value of the RM test data in terms of units of µg/scm. Alternatively, if the RM concentration is less than or equal to 5.0 µg/scm, then the RA results are acceptable if the absolute difference between the means of the RM and sorbent trap monitoring system values does not exceed 1.0 µg/scm.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 Calibration and Standardization</HD>

            <P>10.1 Gaseous and Liquid Standards. Only NIST certified or NIST-traceable calibration standards (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> calibration gases, solutions, <E T="03">etc.</E>) must be used for the spiking and analytical procedures in this performance specification.</P>

            <P>10.2 Gas Flow Meter Calibration. The manufacturer or supplier of the gas flow meter should perform all necessary set-up, testing, programming, <E T="03">etc.,</E> and should provide the end user with any necessary instructions, to ensure that the meter will give an accurate readout of dry gas volume in standard cubic meters for the particular field application.</P>

            <P>10.2.1 Initial Calibration. Prior to its initial use, a calibration of the flow meter must be performed. The initial calibration may be done by the manufacturer, by the equipment supplier, or by the end user. If the flow meter is volumetric in nature (e.g., a dry gas meter), the manufacturer, equipment supplier, or end user may perform a direct volumetric calibration using any gas. For a mass flow meter, the manufacturer, equipment supplier, or end user may calibrate the meter using a bottled gas mixture containing 12 ±0.5% CO<E T="52">2</E>, 7 ±0.5% O<E T="52">2</E>, and balance N<E T="52">2</E>, or these same gases in proportions more representative of the expected stack gas composition. Mass flow meters may also be initially calibrated on-site, using actual stack gas.</P>
            <P>10.2.1.1 Initial Calibration Procedures. Determine an average calibration factor (Y) for the gas flow meter, by calibrating it at three sample flow rate settings covering the range of sample flow rates at which the sorbent trap monitoring system typically operates. Either the procedures in section 10.3.1 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part or the procedures in section 16 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part may be followed. If a dry gas meter is being calibrated, use at least five revolutions of the meter at each flow rate.</P>
            <P>10.2.1.2 Alternative Initial Calibration Procedures. Alternatively, the initial calibration of the gas flow meter may be performed using a reference gas flow meter (RGFM). The RGFM may be either: (1) A wet test meter calibrated according to section 10.3.1 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part; (2) A gas flow metering device calibrated at multiple flow rates using the procedures in section 16 of Method 5 in appendix A-3 to this part; or (3) A NIST-traceable calibration device capable of measuring volumetric flow to an accuracy of 1 percent. To calibrate the gas flow meter using the RGFM, proceed as follows: While the sorbent trap monitoring system is sampling the actual stack gas or a compressed gas mixture that simulates the stack gas composition (as applicable), connect the RGFM to the discharge of the system. Care should be taken to minimize the dead volume between the sample flow meter being tested and the RGFM. Concurrently measure dry gas volume with the RGFM and the flow meter being calibrated for a minimum of 10 minutes at each of three flow rates covering the typical range of operation of the sorbent trap monitoring system. For each 10-minute (or longer) data collection period, record the total sample volume, in units of dry standard cubic meters (dscm), measured by the RGFM and the gas flow meter being tested.</P>
            <P>10.2.1.3 Initial Calibration Factor. Calculate an individual calibration factor Yi at each tested flow rate from section 10.2.1.1 or 10.2.1.2 of this performance specification (as applicable), by taking the ratio of the reference sample volume to the sample volume recorded by the gas flow meter. Average the three Yi values, to determine Y, the calibration factor for the flow meter. Each of the three individual values of Yi must be within ±0.02 of Y. Except as otherwise provided in sections 10.2.1.4 and 10.2.1.5 of this performance specification, use the average Y value from the three level calibration to adjust all subsequent gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter.</P>
            <P>10.2.2 Initial On-Site Calibration Check. For a mass flow meter that was initially calibrated using a compressed gas mixture, an on-site calibration check must be performed before using the flow meter to provide data. While sampling stack gas, check the calibration of the flow meter at one intermediate flow rate typical of normal operation of the monitoring system. Follow the basic procedures in section 10.2.1.1 or 10.2.1.2 of this performance specification. If the onsite calibration check shows that the value of Yi, the calibration factor at the tested flow rate, differs by more than 5 percent from the value of Y obtained in the initial calibration of the meter, repeat the full 3-level calibration of the meter using stack gas to determine a new value of Y, and apply the new Y value to all subsequent gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter.</P>
            <P>10.2.3 Ongoing Quality Control. Recalibrate the gas flow meter quarterly at one intermediate flow rate setting representative of normal operation of the monitoring system. Follow the basic procedures in section 10.2.1.1 or 10.2.1.2 of this performance specification. If a quarterly recalibration shows that the value of Yi, the calibration factor at the tested flow rate, differs from the current value of Y by more than 5 percent, repeat the full 3-level calibration of the meter to determine a new value of Y, and apply the new Y value to all subsequent gas volume measurements made with the gas flow meter.</P>

            <P>10.3 Calibration of Thermocouples and Other Temperature Sensors. Use the procedures and criteria in section 10.3 of Method 2 in appendix A-1 to this part to calibrate in-<PRTPAGE P="750"/>stack temperature sensors and thermocouples. Calibrations must be performed prior to initial use and at least quarterly thereafter. At each calibration point, the absolute temperature measured by the temperature sensor must agree to within ±1.5 percent of the temperature measured with the reference sensor, otherwise the sensor may not continue to be used.</P>
            <P>10.4 Barometer Calibration. Calibrate the barometer against another barometer that has a NIST-traceable calibration. This calibration must be performed prior to initial use and at least quarterly thereafter. At each calibration point, the absolute pressure measured by the barometer must agree to within ±10 mm Hg of the pressure measured by the NIST-traceable barometer, otherwise the barometer may not continue to be used.</P>
            <P>10.5 Calibration of Other Sensors and Gauges. Calibrate all other sensors and gauges according to the procedures specified by the instrument manufacturer(s).</P>
            <P>10.6 Analytical System Calibration. <E T="03">See</E> section 11.1 of this performance specification.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedures</HD>
            <P>The analysis of the Hg samples may be conducted using any instrument or technology capable of quantifying total Hg from the sorbent media and meeting the performance criteria in section 9 of this performance specification.</P>

            <P>11.1 Analyzer System Calibration. Perform a multipoint calibration of the analyzer at three or more upscale points over the desired quantitative range (multiple calibration ranges must be calibrated, if necessary). The field samples analyzed must fall within a calibrated, quantitative range and meet the necessary performance criteria. For samples that are suitable for aliquotting, a series of dilutions may be needed to ensure that the samples fall within a calibrated range. However, for sorbent media samples that are consumed during analysis (e.g., thermal desorption techniques), extra care must be taken to ensure that the analytical system is appropriately calibrated prior to sample analysis. The calibration curve range(s) should be determined based on the anticipated level of Hg mass on the sorbent media. Knowledge of estimated stack Hg concentrations and total sample volume may be required prior to analysis. The calibration curve for use with the various analytical techniques (e.g., UV AA, UV AF, and XRF) can be generated by directly introducing standard solutions into the analyzer or by spiking the standards onto the sorbent media and then introducing into the analyzer after preparing the sorbent/standard according to the particular analytical technique. For each calibration curve, the value of the square of the linear correlation coefficient, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> r<SU>2</SU>, must be ≥0.99, and the analyzer response must be within ±10 percent of reference value at each upscale calibration point. Calibrations must be performed on the day of the analysis, before analyzing any of the samples. Following calibration, an independently prepared standard (not from same calibration stock solution) must be analyzed. The measured value of the independently prepared standard must be within ±10 percent of the expected value.</P>

            <P>11.2 Sample Preparation. Carefully separate the three sections of each sorbent trap. Combine for analysis all materials associated with each section, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> any supporting substrate that the sample gas passes through prior to entering a media section (e.g., glass wool, polyurethane foam, <E T="03">etc.</E>) must be analyzed with that segment.</P>

            <P>11.3 Spike Recovery Study. Before analyzing any field samples, the laboratory must demonstrate the ability to recover and quantify Hg from the sorbent media by performing the following spike recovery study for sorbent media traps spiked with elemental mercury. Using the procedures described in sections 6.2 and 12.1 of this performance specification, spike the third section of nine sorbent traps with gaseous Hg<SU>0</SU>, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> three traps at each of three different mass loadings, representing the range of masses anticipated in the field samples. This will yield a 3 × 3 sample matrix. Prepare and analyze the third section of each spiked trap, using the techniques that will be used to prepare and analyze the field samples. The average recovery for each spike concentration must be between 85 and 115 percent. If multiple types of sorbent media are to be analyzed, a separate spike recovery study is required for each sorbent material. If multiple ranges are calibrated, a separate spike recovery study is required for each range.</P>

            <P>11.4 Field Sample Analyses. Analyze the sorbent trap samples following the same procedures that were used for conducting the spike recovery study. The three sections of each sorbent trap must be analyzed separately (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> section 1, then section 2, then section 3). Quantify the total mass of Hg for each section based on analytical system response and the calibration curve from section 11.1 of this performance specification. Determine the spike recovery from sorbent trap section 3. The spike recovery must be no less than 75 percent and no greater than 125 percent. To report the final Hg mass for each trap, add together the Hg masses collected in trap sections 1 and 2.</P>

Calculate M<E T="52">exp</E>, the expected Hg mass that will <PRTPAGE P="751"/>be collected in section 1 of the trap, using Equation 12B-1.

            <P>12.8 Data Reduction. Typical monitoring periods for normal, day-to-day operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system range from about 24 hours to 168 hours. For the required RA tests of the system, smaller sorbent traps are often used, and the “monitoring period” or time per run is considerably shorter (e.g., 1 hour or less). Generally speaking, to validate sorbent trap monitoring system data, the acceptance criteria for the following five QC specifications in Table 12B-1 above must be met for both traps: (a) the post-monitoring leak check; (b) the ratio of stack gas flow rate to sample flow rate; (c) section 2 breakthrough; (d) paired trap agreement; and (e) section 3 spike recovery.</P>
            <P>12.8.1 For routine day-to-day operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system, when both traps meet the acceptance criteria for all five QC specifications, the two measured Hg concentrations must be averaged arithmetically and the average value must be applied to each hour of the data collection period.</P>

            <P>12.8.2 To validate a RA test run, both traps must meet the acceptance criteria for all five QC specifications. However, as specified <PRTPAGE P="753"/>in section 12.8.3 below, for routine day-to-day operation of the monitoring system, a monitoring period may, in certain instances, be validated based on the results from one trap.</P>
            <P>12.8.3 For the routine, day-to-day operation of the monitoring system, when one of the two sorbent trap samples or sampling systems either: (a) Fails the post-monitoring leak check; or (b) has excessive section 2 breakthrough; or (c) fails to maintain the proper stack flow-to-sample flow ratio; or (d) fails to achieve the required section 3 spike recovery; or (e) is lost, broken, or damaged, provided that the other trap meets the acceptance criteria for all four of these QC specifications, the Hg concentration measured by the valid trap may be multiplied by a factor of 1.111 and then used for reporting purposes. Further, if both traps meet the acceptance criteria for all four of these QC specifications, but the acceptance criterion for paired trap agreement is not met, the owner or operator may report the higher of the two Hg concentrations measured by the traps, in lieu of invalidating the data from the paired traps.</P>

            <P>12.8.4 Whenever the data from a pair of sorbent traps must be invalidated and no quality-assured data from a certified backup Hg monitoring system or Hg reference method are available to cover the hours in the data collection period, treat those hours in the manner specified in the applicable regulation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> use missing data substitution procedures or count the hours as monitoring system down time, as appropriate).</P>

            <P>1.1 Analytes. This performance specification is applicable for measuring all hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) which absorb in the infrared region and can be quantified using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), as long as the performance criteria of this performance specification are met. This specification is to be used for evaluating FTIR continuous emission monitoring systems for measuring HAPs regulated under Title III of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. This specification also applies to the use of FTIR CEMs for measuring other volatile organic or inorganic species.</P>
            <P>1.2 Applicability. A source which can demonstrate that the extractive FTIR system meets the criteria of this performance specification for each regulated pollutant may use the FTIR system to continuously monitor for the regulated pollutants.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Performance Specification</HD>

            <P>For compound-specific sampling requirements refer to FTIR sampling methods (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> reference 1). For data reduction procedures and requirements refer to the EPA FTIR Protocol (reference 2), hereafter referred to as the “FTIR Protocol.” This specification describes sampling and analytical procedures for quality assurance. The infrared spectrum of any absorbing compound provides a distinct signature. The infrared spectrum of a mixture contains the superimposed spectra of each mixture component. Thus, an FTIR CEM provides the capability to continuously measure multiple components in a sample using a single analyzer. The number of compounds that can be speciated in a single spectrum depends, in practice, on the specific compounds present and the test conditions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions</HD>
            <P>For a list of definitions related to FTIR spectroscopy refer to Appendix A of the FTIR Protocol. Unless otherwise specified, spectroscopic terms, symbols and equations in this performance specification are taken from the FTIR Protocol or from documents cited in the Protocol. Additional definitions are given below.</P>
            <P>3.1 FTIR Continuous Emission Monitoring System (FTIR CEM).</P>
            <P>3.1.1 <E T="03">FTIR System.</E> Instrument to measure spectra in the mid-infrared spectral region (500 to 4000 cm<E T="51">−1</E>). It contains an infrared source, interferometer, sample gas containment cell, infrared detector, and computer. The interferometer consists of a beam splitter that divides the beam into two paths, one <PRTPAGE P="754"/>path a fixed distance and the other a variable distance. The computer is equipped with software to run the interferometer and store the raw digitized signal from the detector (interferogram). The software performs the mathematical conversion (the Fourier transform) of the interferogram into a spectrum showing the frequency dependent sample absorbance. All spectral data can be stored on computer media.</P>
            <P>3.1.2 <E T="03">Gas Cell.</E> A gas containment cell that can be evacuated. It contains the sample as the infrared beam passes from the interferometer, through the sample, and to the detector. The gas cell may have multi-pass mirrors depending on the required detection limit(s) for the application.</P>
            <P>3.1.3 <E T="03">Sampling System.</E> Equipment used to extract sample from the test location and transport the gas to the FTIR analyzer. Sampling system components include probe, heated line, heated non-reactive pump, gas distribution manifold and valves, flow measurement devices and any sample conditioning systems.</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Reference CEM.</E> An FTIR CEM, with sampling system, that can be used for comparison measurements.</P>
            <P>3.3 <E T="03">Infrared Band (also Absorbance Band or Band).</E> Collection of lines arising from rotational transitions superimposed on a vibrational transition. An infrared absorbance band is analyzed to determine the analyte concentration.</P>
            <P>3.4 <E T="03">Sample Analysis.</E> Interpreting infrared band shapes, frequencies, and intensities to obtain sample component concentrations. This is usually performed by a software routine using a classical least squares (cls), partial least squares (pls), or K- or P- matrix method.</P>
            <P>3.5 <E T="03">(Target) Analyte.</E> A compound whose measurement is required, usually to some established limit of detection and analytical uncertainty.</P>
            <P>3.6 <E T="03">Interferant.</E> A compound in the sample matrix whose infrared spectrum overlaps at least part of an analyte spectrum complicating the analyte measurement. The interferant may not prevent the analyte measurement, but could increase the analytical uncertainty in the measured concentration. Reference spectra of interferants are used to distinguish the interferant bands from the analyte bands. An interferant for one analyte may not be an interferant for other analytes.</P>
            <P>3.7 <E T="03">Reference Spectrum.</E> Infrared spectra of an analyte, or interferant, prepared under controlled, documented, and reproducible laboratory conditions (see section 4.6 of the FTIR Protocol). A suitable library of reference spectra can be used to measure target analytes in gas samples.</P>
            <P>3.8 <E T="03">Calibration Spectrum.</E> Infrared spectrum of a compound suitable for characterizing the FTIR instrument configuration (Section 4.5 in the FTIR Protocol).</P>
            <P>3.9 <E T="03">One hundred percent line.</E> A double beam transmittance spectrum obtained by combining two successive background single beam spectra. Ideally, this line is equal to 100 percent transmittance (or zero absorbance) at every point in the spectrum. The zero absorbance line is used to measure the RMS noise of the system.</P>
            <P>3.10 <E T="03">Background Deviation.</E> Any deviation (from 100 percent) in the one hundred percent line (or from zero absorbance). Deviations greater than ±5 percent in any analytical region are unacceptable. Such deviations indicate a change in the instrument throughput relative to the single-beam background.</P>
            <P>3.11 <E T="03">Batch Sampling.</E> A gas cell is alternately filled and evacuated. A Spectrum of each filled cell (one discreet sample) is collected and saved.</P>
            <P>3.12 <E T="03">Continuous Sampling.</E> Sample is continuously flowing through a gas cell. Spectra of the flowing sample are collected at regular intervals.</P>
            <P>3.13 <E T="03">Continuous Operation.</E> In continuous operation an FTIR CEM system, without user intervention, samples flue gas, records spectra of samples, saves the spectra to a disk, analyzes the spectra for the target analytes, and prints concentrations of target analytes to a computer file. User intervention is permitted for initial set-up of sampling system, initial calibrations, and periodic maintenance.</P>
            <P>3.14 <E T="03">Sampling Time.</E> In batch sampling—the time required to fill the cell with flue gas. In continuous sampling—the time required to collect the infrared spectrum of the sample gas.</P>
            <P>3.15 PPM-Meters. Sample concentration expressed as the concentration-path length product, ppm (molar) concentration multiplied by the path length of the FTIR gas cell. Expressing concentration in these units provides a way to directly compare measurements made using systems with different optical configurations. Another useful expression is (ppm-meters)/K, where K is the absolute temperature of the sample in the gas cell.</P>
            <P>3.16 <E T="03">CEM Measurement Time Constant.</E> The Time Constant (TC, minutes for one cell volume to flow through the cell) determines the minimum interval for complete removal of an analyte from the FTIR cell. It depends on the sampling rate (R<E T="52">s</E> in Lpm), the FTIR cell volume (V<E T="52">cell</E> in L) and the chemical and physical properties of an analyte.</P>
            <MATH DEEP="27" SPAN="1">
              <MID>ER17OC00.464</MID>
            </MATH>

            <FP>For example, if the sample flow rate (through the FTIR cell) is 5 Lpm and the cell volume is 7 liters, then TC is equal to 1.4 <PRTPAGE P="755"/>minutes (0.71 cell volumes per minute). This performance specification defines 5 * TC as the minimum interval between independent samples.</FP>
            <P>3.17 <E T="03">Independent Measurement.</E> Two independent measurements are spectra of two independent samples. Two independent samples are separated by, at least 5 cell volumes. The interval between independent measurements depends on the cell volume and the sample flow rate (through the cell). There is no mixing of gas between two independent samples. Alternatively, estimate the analyte residence time empirically: (1) Fill cell to ambient pressure with a (known analyte concentration) gas standard, (2) measure the spectrum of the gas standard, (3) purge the cell with zero gas at the sampling rate and collect a spectrum every minute until the analyte standard is no longer detected spectroscopically. If the measured time corresponds to less than 5 cell volumes, use 5 * TC as the minimum interval between independent measurements. If the measured time is greater than 5 * TC, then use this time as the minimum interval between independent measurements.</P>
            <P>3.18 <E T="03">Test Condition.</E> A period of sampling where all process, and sampling conditions, and emissions remain constant and during which a single sampling technique and a single analytical program are used. One Run may include results for more than one test condition. Constant emissions means that the composition of the emissions remains approximately stable so that a single analytical program is suitable for analyzing all of the sample spectra. A greater than two-fold change in analyte or interferant concentrations or the appearance of additional compounds in the emissions, may constitute a new test condition and may require modification of the analytical program.</P>
            <P>3.19 <E T="03">Run.</E> A single Run consists of spectra (one spectrum each) of at least 10 independent samples over a minimum of one hour. The concentration results from the spectra can be averaged together to give a run average for each analyte measured in the test run.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>
            <P>Several compounds, including water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, are known interferences in the infrared region in which the FTIR instrument operates. Follow the procedures in the FTIR protocol for subtracting or otherwise dealing with these and other interferences.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 Safety</HD>
            <P>The procedures required under this performance specification may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This performance specification may not address all of the safety problems associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS users manual and materials recommended by this performance specification should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>6.1 Installation of sampling equipment should follow requirements of FTIR test Methods such as references 1 and 3 and the EPA FTIR Protocol (reference 2). Select test points where the gas stream composition is representative of the process emissions. If comparing to a reference method, the probe tips for the FTIR CEM and the RM should be positioned close together using the same sample port if possible.</P>

            <P>6.2 FTIR Specifications. The FTIR CEM must be equipped with reference spectra bracketing the range of path length-concentrations (absorbance intensities) to be measured for each analyte. The effective concentration range of the analyzer can be adjusted by changing the path length of the gas cell or by diluting the sample. The optical configuration of the FTIR system must be such that maximum absorbance of any target analyte is no greater than 1.0 and the minimum absorbance of any target analyte is at least 10 times the RMSD noise in the analytical region. For example, if the measured RMSD in an analytical region is equal to 10<E T="51">−3</E>, then the peak analyte absorbance is required to be at least 0.01. Adequate measurement of all of the target analytes may require changing path lengths during a run, conducting separate runs for different analytes, diluting the sample, or using more than one gas cell.</P>
            <P>6.3 Data Storage Requirements. The system must have sufficient capacity to store all data collected in one week of routine sampling. Data must be stored to a write-protected medium, such as write-once-read-many (WORM) optical storage medium or to a password protected remote storage location. A back-up copy of all data can be temporarily saved to the computer hard drive. The following items must be stored during testing.</P>
            <P>• At least one sample interferogram per sampling Run or one interferogram per hour, whichever is greater. This assumes that no sampling or analytical conditions have changed during the run.</P>
            <P>• All sample absorbance spectra (about 12 per hr, 288 per day).</P>
            <P>• All background spectra and interferograms (variable, but about 5 per day).</P>
            <P>• All CTS spectra and interferograms (at least 2 each 24 hour period).</P>

            <P>• Documentation showing a record of resolution, path length, apodization, sampling <PRTPAGE P="756"/>time, sampling conditions, and test conditions for all sample, CTS, calibration, and background spectra.</P>
            <P>Using a resolution of 0.5 cm<E T="51">−1</E>, with analytical range of 3500 cm<E T="51">−1</E>, assuming about 65 Kbytes per spectrum and 130 Kb per interferogram, the storage requirement is about 164 Mb for one week of continuous sampling. Lower spectral resolution requires less storage capacity. All of the above data must be stored for at least two weeks. After two weeks, storage requirements include: (1) all analytical results (calculated concentrations), (2) at least 1 sample spectrum with corresponding background and sample interferograms for each test condition, (3) CTS and calibration spectra with at least one interferogram for CTS and all interferograms for calibrations, (4) a record of analytical input used to produce results, and (5) all other documentation. These data must be stored according to the requirements of the applicable regulation.</P>

            <P>These procedures shall be used for periodic quarterly or semiannual QA/QC checks on the operation of the FTIR CEM. Some procedures test only the analytical program and are not intended as a test of the sampling system.</P>
            <P>9.1 Audit Sample. This can serve as a check on both the sampling system and the analytical program.</P>
            <P>9.1.1 Sample Requirements. The audit sample can be a mixture or a single component. It must contain target analyte(s) at approximately the expected flue gas concentration(s). If possible, each mixture component concentration should be NIST traceable (±2 percent accuracy). If a cylinder mixture standard(s) cannot be obtained, then, alternatively, a gas phase standard can be generated from a condensed phase analyte sample. Audit sample contents and concentrations are not revealed to the FTIR CEM operator until after successful completion of procedures in 5.3.2.</P>

            <P>9.1.2 Test Procedure. Spike the audit sample using the analyte spike procedure in section 11. The audit sample is measured directly by the FTIR system (undiluted) and then spiked into the effluent at a known dilution ratio. Measure a series of spiked and unspiked samples using the same procedures as those used to analyze the stack gas. Analyze the results using sections 12.1 and 12.2. The measured concentration of each analyte must be within ±5 percent of the expected concentration (plus the uncertainty), <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the calculated correction factor must be within 0.93 and 1.07 for an audit with an analyte uncertainty of ±2 percent.</P>
            <P>9.2 Audit Spectra. Audit spectra can be used to test the analytical program of the FTIR CEM, but provide no test of the sampling system.</P>
            <P>9.2.1 Definition and Requirements. Audit spectra are absorbance spectra that; (1) have been well characterized, and (2) contain absorbance bands of target analyte(s) and potential interferants at intensities equivalent to what is expected in the source effluent. Audit spectra are provided by the administrator without identifying information. Methods of preparing Audit spectra include; (1) mathematically adding sample spectra or adding reference and interferant spectra, (2) obtaining sample spectra of mixtures prepared in the laboratory, or (3) they may be sample spectra collected previously at a similar source. In the last case it must be demonstrated that the analytical results are correct and reproducible. A record associated with each Audit spectrum documents its method of preparation. The documentation must be sufficient to enable an independent analyst to reproduce the Audit spectra.</P>
            <P>9.2.2 Test Procedure. Audit spectra concentrations are measured using the FTIR CEM analytical program. Analytical results must be within ±5 percent of the certified audit concentration for each analyte (plus the uncertainty in the audit concentration). If the condition is not met, demonstrate how the audit spectra are unrepresentative of the sample spectra. If the audit spectra are representative, modify the FTIR CEM analytical program until the test requirement is met. Use the new analytical program in subsequent FTIR CEM analyses of effluent samples.</P>

            <P>9.3 Submit Spectra For Independent Analysis. This procedure tests only the analytical program and not the FTIR CEM sampling system. The analyst can submit FTIR CEM spectra for independent analysis by EPA. Requirements for submission include; (1) three representative absorbance spectra (and stored interferograms) for each test period to be reviewed, (2) corresponding CTS spectra, (3) corresponding background spectra and interferograms, (4) spectra of associated spiked samples if applicable, and (5) analytical results for these sample spectra. The analyst will also submit documentation of process times and conditions, sampling conditions associated with each spectrum, file names and sampling times, method of analysis and reference spectra used, optical configuration of FTIR CEM including cell path length and temperature, spectral resolution and apodization used for every spectrum. Independent analysis can also be performed on site in conjunction with the FTIR CEM sampling and analysis. Sample spectra are stored on the independent analytical system <PRTPAGE P="757"/>as they are collected by the FTIR CEM system. The FTIR CEM and the independent analyses are then performed separately. The two analyses will agree to within ±120 percent for each analyte using the procedure in section 12.3. This assumes both analytical routines have properly accounted for differences in optical path length, resolution, and temperature between the sample spectra and the reference spectra.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 Calibration and Standardization</HD>
            <P>10.1 Calibration Transfer Standards. For CTS requirements see section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol. A well characterized absorbance band in the CTS gas is used to measure the path length and line resolution of the instrument. The CTS measurements made at the beginning of every 24 hour period must agree to within ±5 percent after correction for differences in pressure.</P>
            <P>Verify that the frequency response of the instrument and CTS absorbance intensity are correct by comparing to other CTS spectra or by referring to the literature.</P>
            <P>10.2 Analyte Calibration. If EPA library reference spectra are not available, use calibration standards to prepare reference spectra according to section 6 of the FTIR Protocol. A suitable set of analyte reference data includes spectra of at least 2 independent samples at each of at least 2 different concentrations. The concentrations bracket a range that includes the expected analyte absorbance intensities. The linear fit of the reference analyte band areas must have a fractional calibration uncertainty (FCU in Appendix F of the FTIR Protocol) of no greater than 10 percent. For requirements of analyte standards refer to section 4.6 of the FTIR Protocol.</P>
            <P>10.3 System Calibration. The calibration standard is introduced at a point on the sampling probe. The sampling system is purged with the calibration standard to verify that the absorbance measured in this way is equal to the absorbance in the analyte calibration. Note that the system calibration gives no indication of the ability of the sampling system to transport the target analyte(s) under the test conditions.</P>
            <P>10.4 Analyte Spike. The target analyte(s) is spiked at the outlet of the sampling probe, upstream of the particulate filter, and combined with effluent at a ratio of about 1 part spike to 9 parts effluent. The measured absorbance of the spike is compared to the expected absorbance of the spike plus the analyte concentration already in the effluent. This measures sampling system bias, if any, as distinguished from analyzer bias. It is important that spiked sample pass through all of the sampling system components before analysis.</P>

            <P>10.5 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N). The measure of S/N in this performance specification is the root-mean-square (RMS) noise level as given in Appendix C of the FTIR Protocol. The RMS noise level of a contiguous segment of a spectrum is defined as the RMS difference (RMSD) between the n contiguous absorbance values (A<E T="52">i</E>) which form the segment and the mean value (A<E T="52">M</E>) of that segment.</P>

              <MID>ER17OC00.465</MID>
            </MATH>
            <FP>A decrease in the S/N may indicate a loss in optical throughput, or detector or interferometer malfunction.</FP>
            <P>10.6 Background Deviation. The 100 percent baseline must be between 95 and 105 percent transmittance (absorbance of 0.02 to −0.02) in every analytical region. When background deviation exceeds this range, a new background spectrum must be collected using nitrogen or other zero gas.</P>
            <P>10.7 Detector Linearity. Measure the background and CTS at three instrument aperture settings; one at the aperture setting to be used in the testing, and one each at settings one half and twice the test aperture setting. Compare the three CTS spectra. CTS band areas should agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard. If test aperture is the maximum aperture, collect CTS spectrum at maximum aperture, then close the aperture to reduce the IR through-put by half. Collect a second background and CTS at the smaller aperture setting and compare the spectra as above. Instead of changing the aperture neutral density filters can be used to attenuate the infrared beam. Set up the FTIR system as it will be used in the test measurements. Collect a CTS spectrum. Use a neutral density filter to attenuate the infrared beam (either immediately after the source or the interferometer) to approximately <FR>1/2</FR> its original intensity. Collect a second CTS spectrum. Use another filter to attenuate the infrared beam to approximately <FR>1/4</FR> its original intensity. Collect a third background and CTS spectrum. Compare the CTS spectra as above. Another check on linearity is to observe the single beam background in frequency regions where the optical configuration is known to have a zero response. Verify that the detector response is “flat” and equal to zero in these regions. If detector response is not linear, decrease aperture, or attenuate the infrared beam. Repeat the linearity check until system passes the requirement.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.0 Analytical Procedure</HD>

            <P>11.1 Initial Certification. First, perform the evaluation procedures in section 6.0 of the FTIR Protocol. The performance of an FTIR CEM can be certified upon installation using EPA Method 301 type validation (40 CFR, Part 63, Appendix A), or by comparison to a <PRTPAGE P="758"/>reference Method if one exists for the target analyte(s). Details of each procedure are given below. Validation testing is used for initial certification upon installation of a new system. Subsequent performance checks can be performed with more limited analyte spiking. Performance of the analytical program is checked initially, and periodically as required by EPA, by analyzing audit spectra or audit gases.</P>
            <P>11.1.1 Validation. Use EPA Method 301 type sampling (reference 4, section 5.3 of Method 301) to validate the FTIR CEM for measuring the target analytes. The analyte spike procedure is as follows: (1) a known concentration of analyte is mixed with a known concentration of a non-reactive tracer gas, (2) the undiluted spike gas is sent directly to the FTIR cell and a spectrum of this sample is collected, (3) pre-heat the spiked gas to at least the sample line temperature, (4) introduce spike gas at the back of the sample probe upstream of the particulate filter, (5) spiked effluent is carried through all sampling components downstream of the probe, (6) spike at a ratio of roughly 1 part spike to 9 parts flue gas (or more dilute), (7) the spike-to-flue gas ratio is estimated by comparing the spike flow to the total sample flow, and (8) the spike ratio is verified by comparing the tracer concentration in spiked flue gas to the tracer concentration in undiluted spike gas. The analyte flue gas concentration is unimportant as long as the spiked component can be measured and the sample matrix (including interferences) is similar to its composition under test conditions. Validation can be performed using a single FTIR CEM analyzing sample spectra collected sequentially. Since flue gas analyte (unspiked) concentrations can vary, it is recommended that two separate sampling lines (and pumps) are used; one line to carry unspiked flue gas and the other line to carry spiked flue gas. Even with two sampling lines the variation in unspiked concentration may be fast compared to the interval between consecutive measurements. Alternatively, two FTIR CEMs can be operated side-by-side, one measuring spiked sample, the other unspiked sample. In this arrangement spiked and unspiked measurements can be synchronized to minimize the affect of temporal variation in the unspiked analyte concentration. In either sampling arrangement, the interval between measured concentrations used in the statistical analysis should be, at least, 5 cell volumes (5 * TC in equation 1). A validation run consists of, at least, 24 independent analytical results, 12 spiked and 12 unspiked samples. See section 3.17 for definition of an “independent” analytical result. The results are analyzed using sections 12.1 and 12.2 to determine if the measurements passed the validation requirements. Several analytes can be spiked and measured in the same sampling run, but a separate statistical analysis is performed for each analyte. In lieu of 24 independent measurements, averaged results can be used in the statistical analysis. In this procedure, a series of consecutive spiked measurements are combined over a sampling period to give a single average result. The related unspiked measurements are averaged in the same way. The minimum 12 spiked and 12 unspiked result averages are obtained by averaging measurements over subsequent sampling periods of equal duration. The averaged results are grouped together and statistically analyzed using section 12.2.</P>
            <P>11.1.1.1 Validation with a Single Analyzer and Sampling Line. If one sampling line is used, connect the sampling system components and purge the entire sampling system and cell with at least 10 cell volumes of sample gas. Begin sampling by collecting spectra of 2 independent unspiked samples. Introduce the spike gas into the back of the probe, upstream of the particulate filter. Allow 10 cell volumes of spiked flue gas to purge the cell and sampling system. Collect spectra of 2 independent spiked samples. Turn off the spike flow and allow 10 cell volumes of unspiked flue gas to purge the FTIR cell and sampling system. Repeat this procedure 6 times until the 24 samples are collected. Spiked and unspiked samples can also be measured in groups of 4 instead of in pairs. Analyze the results using sections 12.1 and 12.2. If the statistical analysis passes the validation criteria, then the validation is completed. If the results do not pass the validation, the cause may be that temporal variations in the analyte sample gas concentration are fast relative to the interval between measurements. The difficulty may be avoided by: (1) Averaging the measurements over long sampling periods and using the averaged results in the statistical analysis, (2) modifying the sampling system to reduce TC by, for example, using a smaller volume cell or increasing the sample flow rate, (3) using two sample lines (4) use two analyzers to perform synchronized measurements. This performance specification permits modifications in the sampling system to minimize TC if the other requirements of the validation sampling procedure are met.</P>

            <P>11.1.1.2 Validation With a Single Analyzer and Two Sampling Lines. An alternative sampling procedure uses two separate sample lines, one carrying spiked flue gas, the other carrying unspiked gas. A valve in the gas distribution manifold allows the operator to choose either sample. A short heated line connects the FTIR cell to the 3-way valve in the manifold. Both sampling lines are continuously purged. Each sample line has a rotameter and a bypass vent line after the rotameter, immediately upstream of the valve, so that the spike and unspiked sample flows can each be continuously monitored. Begin <PRTPAGE P="759"/>sampling by collecting spectra of 2 independent unspiked samples. Turn the sampling valve to close off the unspiked gas flow and allow the spiked flue gas to enter the FTIR cell. Isolate and evacuate the cell and fill with the spiked sample to ambient pressure. (While the evacuated cell is filling, prevent air leaks into the cell by making sure that the spike sample rotameter always indicates that a portion of the flow is directed out the by-pass vent.) Open the cell outlet valve to allow spiked sample to continuously flow through the cell. Measure spectra of 2 independent spiked samples. Repeat this procedure until at least 24 samples are collected.</P>

            <P>11.1.1.3 Synchronized Measurements With Two Analyzers. Use two FTIR analyzers, each with its own cell, to perform synchronized spiked and unspiked measurements. If possible, use a similar optical configuration for both systems. The optical configurations are compared by measuring the same CTS gas with both analyzers. Each FTIR system uses its own sampling system including a separate sampling probe and sampling line. A common gas distribution manifold can be used if the samples are never mixed. One sampling system and analyzer measures spiked effluent. The other sampling system and analyzer measures unspiked flue gas. The two systems are synchronized so that each measures spectra at approximately the same times. The sample flow rates are also synchronized so that both sampling rates are approximately the same (TC<E T="52">1</E> ~ TC<E T="52">2</E> in equation 1). Start both systems at the same time. Collect spectra of at least 12 independent samples with each (spiked and unspiked) system to obtain the minimum 24 measurements. Analyze the analytical results using sections 12.1 and 12.2. Run averages can be used in the statistical analysis instead of individual measurements.</P>
            <P>11.1.1.4 Compare to a Reference Method (RM). Obtain EPA approval that the method qualifies as an RM for the analyte(s) and the source to be tested. Follow the published procedures for the RM in preparing and setting up equipment and sampling system, performing measurements, and reporting results. Since FTIR CEMS have multicomponent capability, it is possible to perform more than one RM simultaneously, one for each target analyte. Conduct at least 9 runs where the FTIR CEM and the RM are sampling simultaneously. Each Run is at least 30 minutes long and consists of spectra of at least 5 independent FTIR CEM samples and the corresponding RM measurements. If more than 9 runs are conducted, the analyst may eliminate up to 3 runs from the analysis if at least 9 runs are used.</P>

            <P>11.1.1.4.1 RMs Using Integrated Sampling. Perform the RM and FTIR CEM sampling simultaneously. The FTIR CEM can measure spectra as frequently as the analyst chooses (and should obtain measurements as frequently as possible) provided that the measurements include spectra of at least 5 independent measurements every 30 minutes. Concentration results from all of the FTIR CEM spectra within a run may be averaged for use in the statistical comparison even if all of the measurements are not independent. When averaging the FTIR CEM concentrations within a run, it is permitted to exclude some measurements from the average provided the minimum of 5 independent measurements every 30 minutes are included: The Run average of the FTIR CEM measurements depends on both the sample flow rate and the measurement frequency (MF). The run average of the RM using the integrated sampling method depends primarily on its sampling rate. If the target analyte concentration fluctuates significantly, the contribution to the run average of a large fluctuation depends on the sampling rate and measurement frequency, and on the duration and magnitude of the fluctuation. It is, therefore, important to carefully select the sampling rate for both the FTIR CEM and the RM and the measurement frequency for the FTIR CEM. The minimum of 9 run averages can be compared according to the relative accuracy test procedure in Performance Specification 2 for SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMs (40 CFR, Part 60, App. B).</P>
            <P>11.1.1.4.2 RMs Using a Grab Sampling Technique. Synchronize the RM and FTIR CEM measurements as closely as possible. For a grab sampling RM, record the volume collected and the exact sampling period for each sample. Synchronize the FTIR CEM so that the FTIR measures a spectrum of a similar cell volume at the same time as the RM grab sample was collected. Measure at least five independent samples with both the FTIR CEM and the RM for each of the minimum nine runs. Compare the run concentration averages by using the relative accuracy analysis procedure in Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60.</P>

            <P>11.1.1.4.3 Continuous Emission Monitors as RMs. If the RM is a CEM, synchronize the sampling flow rates of the RM and the FTIR CEM. Each run is at least 1 hour long and consists of at least 10 FTIR CEM measurements and the corresponding 10 RM measurements (or averages). For the statistical comparison, use the relative accuracy analysis procedure in Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. If the RM time constant is &lt; <FR>1/2</FR> the FTIR CEM time constant, brief fluctuations in analyte concentrations that are not adequately measured with the slower FTIR CEM time constant can be excluded from the run average along with the corresponding RM measurements. However, the FTIR CEM run average must still include at least 10 measurements over a 1-hour period.<PRTPAGE P="760"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Performance Specification 16—Specifications and Test Procedures for Predictive Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <P>1.1 <E T="03">Does this performance specification apply to me?</E> If you, the source owner or operator, intend to use (with any necessary approvals) a predictive emission monitoring system (PEMS) to show compliance with your emission limitation under 40 CFR 60, 61, or 63, you must use the procedures in this performance specification (PS) to determine whether your PEMS is acceptable for use in demonstrating compliance with applicable requirements. Use these procedures to certify your PEMS after initial installation and periodically thereafter to ensure the PEMS is operating properly. If your PEMS contains a diluent (O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E>) measuring component and your emissions limitation is in units that require a diluent measurement (<E T="03">e.g.</E> lbs/mm Btu), the diluent component must be tested as well. These specifications apply to PEMS that are installed under 40 CFR 60, 61, and 63 after the effective date of this performance specification. These specifications do not apply to parametric monitoring systems, these are covered under PS-17.</P>
            <P>1.1.1 <E T="03">How do I certify my PEMS after it is installed?</E> PEMS must pass a relative accuracy (RA) test and accompanying statistical tests in the initial certification test to be acceptable for use in demonstrating compliance with applicable requirements. Ongoing quality assurance tests also must be conducted to ensure the PEMS is operating properly. An ongoing sensor evaluation procedure must be in place before the PEMS certification is complete. The amount of testing and data validation that is required depends upon the regulatory needs, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, whether precise quantification of emissions will be needed or whether indication of exceedances of some regulatory threshold will suffice. Performance criteria are more rigorous for PEMS used in determining continual compliance with an emission limit than those used to measure excess emissions. You must perform the initial certification test on your PEMS before reporting any PEMS data as quality-assured.</P>
            <P>1.1.2 <E T="03">Is other testing required after certification?</E> After you initially certify your PEMS, you must pass additional periodic performance checks to ensure the long-term quality of data. These periodic checks are listed in the table in section 9. You are always responsible for properly maintaining and operating your PEMS.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Performance Specification</HD>
            <P>The following performance tests are required in addition to other equipment and measurement location requirements.</P>
            <P>2.1 Initial PEMS Certification.</P>
            <P>2.1.1 Excess Emissions PEMS. For a PEMS that is used for excess emission reporting, the owner or operator must perform a minimum 9-run, 3-level (3 runs at each level) RA test (see section 8.2).</P>
            <P>2.1.2 Compliance PEMS. For a PEMS that is used for continual compliance standards, the owner or operator must perform a minimum 27-run, 3-level (9 runs at each level) RA test (see section 8.2). Additionally, the data must be evaluated for bias and by F-test and correlation analysis.</P>

            <P>2.2 Periodic Quality Assurance (QA) Assessments. Owners and operators of all PEMS are required to conduct quarterly relative accuracy audits (RAA) and yearly relative accuracy test audits (RATA) to assess ongoing PEMS operation. The frequency of <PRTPAGE P="763"/>these periodic assessments may be shortened by successful operation during a prior year.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 Definitions</HD>
            <P>The following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>3.1 <E T="03">Centroidal Area</E> means that area in the center of the stack (or duct) comprising no more than 1 percent of the stack cross-sectional area and having the same geometric shape as the stack.</P>
            <P>3.2 <E T="03">Data Recorder</E> means the equipment that provides a permanent record of the PEMS output. The data recorder may include automatic data reduction capabilities and may include electronic data records, paper records, or a combination of electronic data and paper records.</P>
            <P>3.3 <E T="03">Defective sensor</E> means a sensor that is responsible for PEMS malfunction or that operates outside the approved operating envelope. A defective sensor may be functioning properly, but because it is operating outside the approved operating envelope, the resulting predicted emission is not validated.</P>
            <P>3.4 <E T="03">Diluent PEMS</E> means the total equipment required to predict a diluent gas concentration or emission rate.</P>
            <P>3.5 <E T="03">Operating envelope</E> means the defined range of a parameter input that is established during PEMS development. Emission data generated from parameter inputs that are beyond the operating envelope are not considered quality assured and are therefore unacceptable.</P>
            <P>3.6 <E T="03">PEMS</E> means all of the equipment required to predict an emission concentration or emission rate. The system may consist of any of the following major subsystems: sensors and sensor interfaces, emission model, algorithm, or equation that uses process data to generate an output that is proportional to the emission concentration or emission rate, diluent emission model, data recorder, and sensor evaluation system. Systems that use fewer than 3 variables do not qualify as PEMS unless the system has been specifically approved by the Administrator for use as a PEMS. A PEMS may predict emissions data that are corrected for diluent if the relative accuracy and relevant QA tests are passed in the emission units corrected for diluent. Parametric monitoring systems that serve as indicators of compliance and have <E T="03">parametric</E> limits but do not predict emissions to comply with an <E T="03">emissions</E> limit are not included in this definition.</P>
            <P>3.7 <E T="03">PEMS training</E> means the process of developing or confirming the operation of the PEMS against a reference method under specified conditions.</P>
            <P>3.8 <E T="03">Quarter</E> means a quarter of a calendar year in which there are at least 168 unit operating hours.</P>
            <P>3.9 <E T="03">Reconciled Process Data</E> means substitute data that are generated by a sensor evaluation system to replace that of a failed sensor. Reconciled process data may not be used without approval from the Administrator.</P>
            <P>3.10 <E T="03">Relative Accuracy</E> means the accuracy of the PEMS when compared to a reference method (RM) at the source. The RA is the average difference between the pollutant PEMS and RM data for a specified number of comparison runs plus a 2.5 percent confidence coefficient, divided by the average of the RM tests. For a diluent PEMS, the RA may be expressed as a percentage of absolute difference between the PEMS and RM. Alternative specifications are given for units that have very low emissions.</P>
            <P>3.11 <E T="03">Relative Accuracy Audit</E> means a quarterly audit of the PEMS against a portable analyzer meeting the requirements of ASTM D6522-00 or a RM for a specified number of runs. A RM may be used in place of the portable analyzer for the RAA.</P>
            <P>3.12 <E T="03">Relative Accuracy Test Audit</E> means a RA test that is performed at least once every four calendar quarters after the initial certification test while the PEMS is operating at the normal operating level.</P>
            <P>3.13 <E T="03">Reference Value</E> means a PEMS baseline value that may be established by RM testing under conditions when all sensors are functioning properly. This reference value may then be used in the sensor evaluation system or in adjusting new sensors.</P>
            <P>3.14 <E T="03">Sensor Evaluation System</E> means the equipment or procedure used to periodically assess the quality of sensor input data. This system may be a sub-model that periodically cross-checks sensor inputs among themselves or any other procedure that checks sensor integrity at least daily (when operated for more than one hour in any calendar day).</P>
            <P>3.15 <E T="03">Sensors and Sensor Interface</E> means the equipment that measures the process input signals and transports them to the emission prediction system.</P>

            <P>6.1 PEMS Design. You must detail the design of your PEMS and make this available in reports and for on-site inspection. You must also establish the following, as applicable:</P>
            <P>6.1.1 Number of Input Parameters. An acceptable PEMS will normally use three or more input parameters. You must obtain the Administrator's permission on a case-by-case basis if you desire to use a PEMS having fewer than three input parameters.</P>

            <P>6.1.2 Parameter Operating Envelopes. Before you evaluate your PEMS through the certification test, you must specify the input parameters your PEMS uses, define their <PRTPAGE P="764"/>range of minimum and maximum values (operating envelope), and demonstrate the integrity of the parameter operating envelope using graphs and data from the PEMS development process, vendor information, or engineering calculations, as appropriate. If you operate the PEMS beyond these envelopes at any time after the certification test, the data generated during this condition will not be acceptable for use in demonstrating compliance with applicable requirements. If these parameter operating envelopes are not clearly defined and supported by development data, the PEMS operation will be limited to the range of parameter inputs encountered during the certification test until the PEMS has a new operating envelope established.</P>
            <P>6.1.3 Source-Specific Operating Conditions. Identify any source-specific operating conditions, such as fuel type, that affect the output of your PEMS. You may only use the PEMS under the source-specific operating conditions it was certified for.</P>
            <P>6.1.4 Ambient Conditions. You must explain whether and how ambient conditions and seasonal changes affect your PEMS. Some parameters such as absolute ambient humidity cannot be manipulated during a test. The effect of ambient conditions such as humidity on the pollutant concentration must be determined and this effect extrapolated to include future anticipated conditions. Seasonal changes and their effects on the PEMS must be evaluated unless you can show that such effects are negligible.</P>
            <P>6.1.5 PEMS Principle of Operation. If your PEMS is developed on the basis of known physical principles, you must identify the specific physical assumptions or mathematical manipulations that support its operation. If your PEMS is developed on the basis of linear or nonlinear regression analysis, you must make available the paired data (preferably in graphic form) used to develop or train the model.</P>
            <P>6.1.6 Data Recorder Scale. If you are not using a digital recorder, you must choose a recorder scale that accurately captures the desired range of potential emissions. The lower limit of your data recorder's range must be no greater than 20 percent of the applicable emission standard (if subject to an emission standard). The upper limit of your data recorder's range must be determined using the following table. If you obtain approval first, you may use other lower and upper recorder limits.</P>

            <P>6.1.7 Sensor Location and Repair. We recommend you install sensors in an accessible location in order to perform repairs and replacements. Permanently-installed platforms or ladders may not be needed. If you install sensors in an area that is not accessible, you may be required to shut down the emissions unit to repair or replace a sensor. Conduct a new RATA after replacing a sensor that supplies a critical PEMS parameter if the new sensor provides a different output or scaling or changes the historical training dataset of the PEMS. Replacement of a non-critical sensor that does not cause an impact in the accuracy of the PEMS does not trigger a RATA. All sensors must be calibrated as often as needed but at least as often as recommended by the manufacturers.</P>
            <P>6.1.8 Sensor Evaluation System. Your PEMS must be designed to perform automatic or manual determination of defective sensors on at least a daily basis. This sensor evaluation system may consist of a sensor validation sub-model, a comparison of redundant sensors, a spot check of sensor input readings at a reference value, operation, or emission level, or other procedure that detects faulty or failed sensors. Some sensor evaluation systems generate substitute values (reconciled data) that are used when a sensor is perceived to have failed. You must obtain prior approval before using reconciled data.</P>
            <P>6.1.9 Parameter Envelope Exceedances. Your PEMS must include a plan to detect and notify the operator of parameter envelope exceedances. Emission data collected outside the ranges of the sensor envelopes will not be considered quality assured.</P>

            <P>6.2 Recordkeeping. All valid data recorded by the PEMS must be used to calculate the emission value.<PRTPAGE P="765"/>

            <P>8.1 Initial Certification. Use the following procedure to certify your PEMS. Complete all PEMS training before the certification begins.</P>
            <P>8.2 Relative Accuracy Test.</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Reference Methods. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable regulations, you must use the test methods in appendix A of this part for the RM test. Conduct the RM tests at three operating levels. The RM tests shall be performed at a low-load (or production) level between the minimum safe, stable load and 50 percent of the maximum level load, at the mid-load level (an intermediary level between the low and high levels), and at a high-load level between 80 percent and the maximum load. Alternatively, if practicable, you may test at three levels of the key operating parameter (e.g. selected based on a covariance analysis between each parameter and the PEMS output) equally spaced within the normal range of the parameter.</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Number of RM Tests for Excess Emission PEMS. For PEMS used for excess emission reporting, conduct at least the following number of RM tests at the following key parameter operating levels:</P>
            <P>(1) Three at a low level.</P>
            <P>(2) Three at a mid level.</P>
            <P>(3) Three at a high level.</P>
            <P>You may choose to perform more than nine total RM tests. If you perform more than nine tests, you may reject a maximum of three tests as long as the total number of test results used to determine the RA is nine or greater and each operating level has at least three tests. You must report all data, including the rejected data.</P>
            <P>8.2.3 Number of RM Tests for Continual Compliance PEMS. For PEMS used to determine compliance, conduct at least the following number of RM tests at the following key parameter operating levels:</P>
            <P>(1) Nine at a low level.</P>
            <P>(2) Nine at a mid level.</P>
            <P>(3) Nine at a high level.</P>
            <P>You may choose to perform more than 9 RM runs at each operating level. If you perform more than 9 runs, you may reject a maximum of three runs per level as long as the total number of runs used to determine the RA at each operating level is 9 or greater.</P>
            <P>8.2.4 Reference Method Measurement Location. Select an accessible measurement point for the RM that will ensure you measure emissions representatively. Ensure the location is at least two equivalent stack diameters downstream and half an equivalent diameter upstream from the nearest flow disturbance such as the control device, point of pollutant generation, or other place where the pollutant concentration or emission rate can change. You may use a half diameter downstream instead of the two diameters if you meet both of the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) Changes in the pollutant concentration are caused solely by diluent leakage, such as leaks from air heaters.</P>
            <P>(2) You measure pollutants and diluents simultaneously at the same locations.</P>
            <P>8.2.5 Traverse Points. Select traverse points that ensure representative samples. Conduct all RM tests within 3 cm of each selected traverse point but no closer than 3 cm to the stack or duct wall. The minimum requirement for traverse points are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Establish a measurement line across the stack that passes through the center and in the direction of any expected stratification.</P>
            <P>(2) Locate a minimum of three traverse points on the line at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the stack inside diameter.</P>
            <P>(3) Alternatively, if the stack inside diameter is greater than 2.4 meters, you may locate the three traverse points on the line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. You may not use this alternative option after wet scrubbers or at points where two streams with different pollutant concentrations are combined. You may select different traverse points if you demonstrate and provide verification that it provides a representative sample. You may also use the traverse point specifications given the RM.</P>

            <P>8.2.6 Relative Accuracy Procedure. Perform the number of RA tests at the levels required in sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3. For integrated samples (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, Method 3A or 7E), make a sample traverse of at least 21 minutes, sampling for 7 minutes at each traverse point. For grab samples (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, Method 3 or 7), take one sample at each traverse point, scheduling the grab samples so that they are taken simultaneously (within a 3-minute period) or at an equal interval of time apart over a 21-minute period. A test run for grab samples must be made up of at least three separate measurements. Where multiple fuels are used in the monitored unit and the fuel type affects the predicted emissions, determine a RA for each fuel unless the effects of the alternative fuel on predicted emissions or diluent were addressed in the model training process. The unit may only use fuels that have been evaluated this way.</P>
            <P>8.2.7 Correlation of RM and PEMS Data. Mark the beginning and end of each RM test run (including the exact time of day) on the permanent record of PEMS output. Correlate the PEMS and the RM test data by the time and duration using the following steps:</P>
            <P>A. Determine the integrated pollutant concentration for the PEMS for each corresponding RM test period.</P>

            <P>B. Consider system response time, if important, and confirm that the pair of results <PRTPAGE P="766"/>is on a consistent moisture, temperature, and diluent concentration basis.</P>
            <P>C. Compare each average PEMS value to the corresponding average RM value. Use the following guidelines to make these comparisons.</P>

            <P>8.3 Statistical Tests for PEMS that are Used for Continual Compliance. In addition to the RA determination, evaluate the paired RA and PEMS data using the following statistical tests.</P>
            <P>8.3.1 Bias Test. From the RA data taken at the mid-level, determine if a bias exists between the RM and PEMS. Use the equations in section 12.3.1.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 F-test. Perform a separate F-test for the RA paired data from each operating level to determine if the RM and PEMS variances differ by more than might be expected from chance. Use the equations in section 12.3.2.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 Correlation Analysis. Perform a correlation analysis using the RA paired data from all operating levels combined to determine how well the RM and PEMS correlate. Use the equations in section 12.3.3. The correlation is waived if the process cannot be varied to produce a concentration change sufficient for a successful correlation test because of its technical design. In such cases, should a subsequent RATA identify a variation in the RM measured values by more than 30 percent, the waiver will not apply, and a correlation analysis test must be performed at the next RATA.</P>
            <P>8.4 Reporting. Summarize in tabular form the results of the RA and statistical tests. Include all data sheets, calculations, and charts (records of PEMS responses) necessary to verify that your PEMS meets the performance specifications. Include in the report the documentation used to establish your PEMS parameter envelopes.</P>

            <P>8.5 Reevaluating Your PEMS After a Failed Test, Change in Operations, or Change in Critical PEMS Parameter. After initial certification, if your PEMS fails to pass a quarterly RAA or yearly RATA, or if changes occur or are made that could result in a significant change in the emission rate (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, turbine aging, process modification, new process operating modes, or changes to emission controls), your PEMS must be recertified using the tests and procedures in section 8.1. For example, if you initially developed your PEMS for the emissions unit operating at 80-100 percent of its range, you would have performed the initial test under these conditions. Later, if you wanted to operate the emission unit at 50-100 percent of its range, you must conduct another RA test and statistical tests, as applicable, to verify that the new conditions of 50-100 percent of range are functional. These tests must demonstrate that your PEMS provides acceptable data when operating in the new range or with the new critical PEMS parameter(s). The requirements of section 8.1 must be completed by the earlier of 60 unit operating days or 180 calendar days after the failed RATA or after the change that caused a significant change in emission rate.</P>

            <P>9.3 Quarterly Relative Accuracy Audits. In the first year of operation after the initial certification, perform a RAA consisting of at least three 30-minute portable analyzer or RM determinations each quarter a RATA is not performed. To conduct a RAA, follow the procedures in Section 8.2 for the relative accuracy test, except that only three sets of measurement data are required, and the statistical tests are not required. The average of the three or more portable analyzer or RM determinations must not exceed the limits given in Section 13.5. Report the data from all sets of measurement data. If a PEMS passes all quarterly RAAs in the first year and also passes the subsequent yearly RATA in the second year, you may elect to perform a single mid-year RAA in the second year in place of the quarterly RAAs. This option may be repeated, but only until the PEMS fails either a mid-year RAA or a yearly RATA. When such a failure occurs, you must resume quarterly RAAs in the quarter following the failure and continue conducting quarterly RAAs until the PEMS successfully passes both a year of quarterly RAAs and a subsequent RATA.</P>
            <P>9.4 Yearly Relative Accuracy Test. Perform a minimum 9-run RATA at the normal operating level on a yearly basis in the quarter that the RAA is not performed. The statistical tests in Section 8.3 are not required for the yearly RATA.</P>

            <P>13.3 PEMS Variance. Your calculated F-value must not be greater than the critical F-value at the 95-percent confidence level for your PEMS to be acceptable.</P>
            <P>13.4 PEMS Correlation. Your calculated r-value must be greater than or equal to 0.8 for your PEMS to be acceptable.</P>
            <P>13.5 Relative Accuracy Audits. The average of the three portable analyzer or RM determinations must not differ from the simultaneous PEMS average value by more than 10 percent of the analyzer or RM for concentrations greater than 100 ppm or 20 percent for concentrations between 100 and 20 ppm, or the test is failed. For measurements at 20 ppm or less, this difference must not exceed 2 ppm for a pollutant PEMS and 1 percent absolute for a diluents PEMS.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Performance Specification 18—Performance Specifications and Test Procedures for Gaseous Hydrogen Chloride (HCI) Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Scope and Application</HD>
            <P>1.1 Analyte. This performance specification (PS) is applicable for measuring gaseous concentrations of hydrogen chloride (HCl), CAS: 7647-01-0, on a continuous basis in the units of the applicable standard or in units that can be converted to units of the applicable standard(s).</P>
            <P>1.2 Applicability.</P>

            <P>1.2.1 This specification is used to evaluate the acceptability of HCl continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) at the time of <PRTPAGE P="771"/>installation or soon after and whenever specified in the regulations. The specification includes requirements for initial acceptance including instrument accuracy and stability assessments and use of audit samples if they are available.</P>
            <P>1.2.2 The Administrator may require the operator, under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, to conduct CEMS performance evaluations at other times besides the initial test to evaluate the CEMS performance. See 40 CFR part 60, §§ 60.13(c) and 63.8(e)(1).</P>

            <P>1.2.3 A source that demonstrates their CEMS meets the criteria of this PS may use the system to continuously monitor gaseous HCl under any regulation or permit that requires compliance with this PS. If your CEMS is capable of reporting the HCl concentration in the units of the applicable standard, no additional CEMS components are necessary. If your CEMS does not report concentrations in the units of the existing standard, then other CEMS components (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>), temperature, stack gas flow, moisture and pressure) may be necessary to convert the units reported by your CEMS to the units of the standard.</P>
            <P>1.2.4 These specification test results are intended to be valid for the life of the system. As a result, the HCl measurement system must be tested and operated in a configuration consistent with the configuration that will be used for ongoing continuous emissions monitoring.</P>
            <P>1.2.5 Substantive changes to the system configuration require retesting according to this PS. Examples of such conditions include, but are not limited to: major changes in dilution ratio (for dilution based systems); changes in sample conditioning and transport, if used, such as filtering device design or materials; changes in probe design or configuration and changes in materials of construction. Changes consistent with instrument manufacturer upgrade that fall under manufacturer's certification do not require additional field verification. Manufacturer's upgrades require recertification by the manufacturer for those requirements allowed by this PS, including interference, level of detection (LOD), and light intensity qualification.</P>
            <P>1.2.6 This specification is not designed to evaluate the ongoing CEMS performance nor does it identify specific calibration techniques and auxiliary procedures to assess CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The requirements in appendix F, Procedure 6 are designed to provide a way to assess CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible to calibrate, maintain, and operate the CEMS properly.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Summary of Performance Specification</HD>
            <P>2.1 This specification covers the procedures that each CEMS must meet during the performance evaluation test. Installation and measurement location specifications, data reduction procedures, and performance criteria are included.</P>
            <P>2.2 The technology used to measure gaseous HCl must provide a distinct response and address any appropriate interference correction(s). It must accurately measure gaseous HCl in a representative sample (path or point sampling) of stack effluent.</P>

            <P>2.3 The relative accuracy (RA) must be established against a reference method (RM) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Method 26A, Method 320, ASTM International (ASTM) D6348-12, including mandatory annexes, or Method 321, as appropriate for the source concentration and category). Method 26 may be approved as a RM by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis if not otherwise allowed or denied in an applicable subpart of the regulations.</P>
            <P>2.4 A standard addition (SA) procedure using a reference standard is included in appendix A to this performance specification for use in verifying LOD. For extractive CEMS, where the SA is done by dynamic spiking (DS), the appendix A procedure is allowed as an option for assessing calibration drift and is also referenced by Procedure 6 of appendix F to this part for ongoing quality control tests.</P>

            <P>3.11 <E T="03">Interference</E> means a compound or material in the sample matrix other than HCl whose characteristics may bias the CEMS measurement (positively or negatively). The interference may not prevent the sample measurement, but could increase the analytical uncertainty in the measured HCl concentration through reaction with HCl or by changing the electronic signal generated during HCl measurement.</P>

There may be several RTs for an instrument related to different functions or procedures (e.g., DS, LOD, and ME).</P>
            <P>3.23 <E T="03">Span value</E> means an HCl concentration approximately equal to two times the concentration equivalent to the emission standard unless otherwise specified in the <PRTPAGE P="773"/>applicable regulation, permit or other requirement. Unless otherwise specified, the span may be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Interferences</HD>

            <P>Sample gas interferences will vary depending on the instrument or technology used to make the measurement. Interferences must be evaluated through the interference test in this PS. Several compounds including carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH<E T="52">2</E>O), methane (CH<E T="52">4</E>), and water (H<E T="52">2</E>O) are potential optical interferences with certain types of HCl monitoring technology. Ammonia is a potential chemical interference with HCl.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 Safety</HD>
            <P>The procedures required under this PS may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This PS may not address all of the safety issues associated with these procedures. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations prior to performing these procedures. The CEMS user's manual and materials recommended by the RM should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</HD>
            <P>Equipment and supplies for CEMS will vary depending on the measurement technology and equipment vendors. This section provides a description of the equipment and supplies typically found in one or more types of CEMS.</P>
            <P>6.1 Sample Extraction System. The portion of an extractive CEMS that collects and transports the sample to the pressure regulation and sample conditioning module. The extraction system must deliver a representative sample to the measurement instrument. The sample extraction system typically consists of a sample probe and a heated umbilical line.</P>
            <P>6.2 Sample Conditioning Module. The portion of an extractive CEMS that removes particulate matter and moisture from the gas stream and provides a sample gas stream to the CEMS analysis module or analyzer. You must keep the particle-free gas sample above the dew point temperature of its components.</P>
            <P>6.3 HClAnalyzer. The portion of the CEMS that detects, quantifies and generates an output proportional to the sample gas HCl concentration.</P>

            <P>6.4 System Controller. The portion of the CEMS that provides control of the analyzer and other sub-systems (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sample extraction, sample conditioning, reference gas) as necessary for continuous operation and periodic maintenance/QC activities.</P>
            <P>6.5 Data Recorder. The portion of the CEMS that provides a record of analyzer output. The data recorder may record other pertinent data such as effluent flow rates, various instrument temperatures or abnormal CEMS operation. The data recorder output range must include the full range of expected HCl concentration values in the gas stream to be sampled including zero and span value.</P>
            <P>6.6 Reference Gas System(s). Gas handling system(s) needed to introduce reference and other gases into the measurement system. For extractive CEMS, the system must be able to introduce gas flow sufficient to flood the sampling probe and prevent entry of gas from the effluent stream. For IP-CEMS, the system must be able to introduce a known concentration of HCl, at known cell length, pressure and temperature, into the optical path used to measure HCl gas concentration.</P>

            <P>6.7 Moisture Measurement System. If correction of the measured HCl emissions for moisture is required, you must install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system for measuring and recording the moisture content of the flue gases. The following continuous moisture monitoring systems are acceptable: An FTIR system validated according to Method 301 or section 13.0 of Method 320 in appendix A to part 63 of this chapter; a continuous moisture sensor; an oxygen analyzer (or analyzers) capable of measuring O<E T="52">2</E> both on a wet basis and on a dry basis; a stack temperature sensor and a moisture look-up table, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> a psychrometric chart (for saturated gas streams following wet scrubbers or other demonstrably saturated gas streams, only); or other continuous moisture measurement methods approved by the Administrator. Alternatively, for any type of fuel, you may determine an appropriate site-specific default moisture value (or values), using measurements made with Method 4—Determination of Moisture Content In Stack Gases, in appendix A-3 to of this part. If this option is selected, the site-specific moisture default value(s) must represent the fuel(s) or fuel blends that are combusted in the unit during normal, stable operation, and must account for any distinct difference(s) in the stack gas moisture content associated with different process operating conditions. At least nine Method 4 runs are required for determining each site-specific default moisture percentage. Calculate each site-specific default moisture value by taking the arithmetic average of the Method 4 runs. Each site-specific moisture default value shall be <PRTPAGE P="774"/>updated whenever the current value is non-representative, due to changes in unit or process operation, but in any event no less frequently than annually.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 Reagents and Standards</HD>
            <P>7.1 Reference Gases. Reference gases (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> cylinder gases or liquid evaporative standards) used to meet the requirements of this PS must be NIST certified or NIST-traceable and vendor certified to ±5.0 percent accuracy. HCl cylinder gases must be certified according to Reference 5 in section 16 of this PS through a documented unbroken chain of comparisons each contributing to the reported uncertainty. Liquid evaporative standards must be certified using the gravimetrically-based procedures of the latest version of the EPA Traceability Protocol for Qualification and Certification of Evaporative HCl Gas Standards and Humidification of HCl Gas Standards from Cylinders (<E T="03">see</E> EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0696-0026.pdf).</P>

Install the CEMS at an accessible location where the pollutant concentration or emission rate measurements are directly representative of the HCl emissions or can be corrected so as to be representative of the total emissions from the affected facility. The CEMS need not be installed at the same location as the relative accuracy test location. If you fail the RA requirements in this specification due to the CEMS measurement location and a satisfactory correction technique cannot be established, the Administrator may require the CEMS to be relocated.</P>

            <P>11.5.3.1 You may not use an effective reference HCl gas concentration greater than five times the estimated instrument LOD.</P>
            <P>11.5.3.2 For extractive CEMS, inject the HCl and interferents described in section 11.1.5 directly into the inlet to the analyzer.</P>
            <P>11.5.3.3 For IP-CEMS, the HCl and interference test gases may be added to a calibration cell or separately in a temperature-controlled cell that is part of the measurement path. The effective concentration of the gas in the cell must meet the requirements in Table 1 corrected for absolute pressure, temperature and the nominal stack sampling path length of the CEMS.</P>
            <P>11.5.4 Collect seven or more consecutive measurements separated by twice the RT (described in section 11.6) to determine the LOD.</P>
            <P>11.5.5 Calculate the standard deviation of the measured values and define the LOD as three times the standard deviation of these measurements.</P>
            <P>11.5.5.1 The LOD for extractive units must be determined and reported in ppmv.</P>
            <P>11.5.5.2 The LOD for IP units must be determined and reported on a ppm-meter basis and the site- or installation-specific LOD must be calculated based on the actual measurement path length and gas density of the emissions at the specific site installation in ppmv.</P>
            <P>11.5.6 You must verify the controlled environment LOD of section 11.5.2 of this PS for your CEMS during initial setup and field certification testing. You must use the SA procedure in appendix A of this PS with the following exceptions:</P>
            <P>11.5.6.1 For the LOD verification in the field, you must make three independent SA measurements spiking the native source concentration by no more than three times the controlled environment LOD concentration determined in section 11.5.5.</P>

            <P>11.5.6.2 For extractive CEMS, you must perform the SA as a dynamic spike by passing the spiked source gas sample through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other monitoring system components used during normal sampling, and as much of the sampling probe as practical. For IP-CEMS, you must perform the SA procedure by adding or passing a known concentration reference gas into a calibration cell in the optical path of the CEMS; you must also include the source <PRTPAGE P="777"/>measurement optical path while performing the SA measurement.</P>

            <P>11.5.6.3 The amount detected, or standard addition response (SAR), is based on the average difference of the native HCl concentration in the stack or duct relative to the native stack concentration plus the SA. You must be able to detect the effective spike addition (ESA) above the native HCl present in the stack gas matrix. For extractive CEMS, the ESA is calculated using Equation A7 in appendix A of this PS. For IP-CEMS, the ESA is calculated as C<E T="52">i,eff</E> using Equation 4 of this PS.</P>
            <P>11.5.6.4 For extractive CEMS, calculate the SAR using Equation A4 in appendix A of this PS. For IP-CEMS, calculate the SAR using Equation A8.</P>
            <P>11.5.6.5 If your system LOD field verification does not demonstrate a SAR greater than or equal to your initial controlled environment LOD, you must increase the SA concentration incrementally and repeat the field verification procedure until the SAR is equal to or greater than LOD. The site-specific standard addition detection level (SADL) is equal to the standard addition needed to achieve the acceptable SAR, and SADL replaces the controlled environment LOD. For extractive CEMS, the SADL is calculated as the ESA using Equation A7 in appendix A of this PS. For IP-CEMS, the SADL is the SA calculated using Equation A8 in appendix A of this PS. As described in section 13.1 of this PS, the LOD or the SADL that replaces an LOD must be less than 20 percent of the applicable emission limit.</P>

For SA RT, introduce zero gas to the IP-CEMS cell or stop the spike gas flow to the extractive CEMS as required by the specified procedure and record the time required to reach 95 percent of the change to the stable instrument response of the native gas reading. This time is the downscale RT.</P>

            <P>11.8.8.2 You must perform the dynamic spike procedure by passing the spiked source gas sample through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners and other monitoring system <PRTPAGE P="779"/>components used during normal sampling, and as much of the sampling probe as practical.</P>
            <P>11.8.8.3 Calculate the mid-level CD as a percent of span using Equation A6 of appendix A to this PS and calculate the zero drift using Equation 3B in section 12.3. Record and report the results as described in sections 11.8.6 and 11.8.7.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.9 Relative Accuracy Test</HD>

            <P>11.9.1 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation, use Method 26A in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, Method 320 or Method 321, both found in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, or ASTM D6348-12 including all annexes, as applicable, as the RMs for HCl measurement. Obtain and analyze RM audit samples, if they are available, concurrently with RM test samples according to the same procedure specified for performance tests in the general provisions of the applicable part. If Method 26 is not specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations, you may request approval to use Method 26 in appendix A-8 to this part as the RM on a site-specific basis under §§ 63.7(f) or 60.8(b). Other RMs for moisture, O<E T="52">2</E>, etc., may be necessary. Conduct the RM tests in such a way that they will yield results representative of the emissions from the source and can be compared to the CEMS data.</P>
            <P>11.9.1.1 When Method 26A is used as the RM, you must sample sufficient gas to reach three times your method detection limit for Method 26A in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8, or for a minimum of one hour, whichever is greater.</P>
            <P>11.9.1.2 When Method 320 or Method 321, both found in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, or ASTM D6348-12, are used as the RM, you must collect gas samples that are at stack conditions (hot and wet) and you must traverse as required in section 11.9.3.</P>
            <P>11.9.2 Conduct the diluent (if applicable), moisture (if needed), and pollutant measurements simultaneously. However, diluent and moisture measurements that are taken within an hour of the pollutant measurements may be used to calculate dry pollutant concentration and emission rates.</P>
            <P>11.9.3 Reference Method Measurement Location and Traverse Point(s) Selection.</P>

            <P>11.9.3.1 Measurement Location. Select, as appropriate, an accessible RM measurement location at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate may occur, and at least one half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or a control device. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> air heater leakages) and pollutants and diluents are simultaneously measured at the same location, a half diameter may be used in lieu of two equivalent diameters. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated according to Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part. The CEMS and RM sampling locations need not be the same.</P>
            <P>11.9.3.2 Traverse Point Selection. Select traverse points that assure acquisition of representative RM samples over the stack or duct cross section according to one of the following options: (a) sample at twelve traverse points located according to section 11.3 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to this part, (b) sample at 6 Method 1 traverse points according to section 6.5.6(b)(1) of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, or (c) sample at three points on a measurement line (“3-point long line”) that passes through the centroidal area of the duct in the direction of any potential stratification. If this line interferes with the CEMS measurements, you may displace the line up to 20 cm (12 in.) or 5.0 percent of the equivalent diameter of the cross section, whichever is less, from the centroidal area. Locate the three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the measurement line. Alternatively, you may conduct a stratification test following the procedures in sections 11.9.3.2.1 through 11.9.3.2.4 to justify sampling at a single point or three points located on the measurement line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 m from the stack wall (“3-point short line”). Stratification testing must be conducted at the sampling location to be used for the RM measurements during the RA test and must be made during normal facility operating conditions. You must evaluate the stratification by measuring the gas on the same moisture basis as the HCl CEMS (wet or dry). Stratification testing must be repeated for each RA test program to justify single point or “3-point short line” sampling.</P>
            <P>11.9.3.2.1 Use a probe of appropriate length to measure the HCl concentration or an alternative analyte, as described in this section, using 12 traverse points located according to section 11.3 of Method 1 in appendix A-1 to 40 CFR part 60 for a circular stack or nine points at the centroids of similarly-shaped, equal area divisions of the cross section of a rectangular stack.</P>

            <P>11.9.3.2.2 You may substitute a stratification test for SO<E T="52">2</E> for the HCl stratification test. If you select this option, you must follow the test procedures in Method 6C of appendix A-4 to 40 CFR part 60 or Method 320 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63.</P>

            <P>11.9.3.2.3 Calculate the mean measured concentration for all sampling points (MN<E T="52">avg</E>).</P>
            <P>11.9.3.2.4 Calculate the percent stratification (S<E T="52">t</E>) of each traverse point using Equation 8 in section 12.5.</P>

            <P>11.9.3.2.5 The gas stream is considered to be unstratified and you may perform the RA testing at a single point that most closely matches the mean if the concentration at <PRTPAGE P="780"/>each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by: (a) No more than 5.0 percent of the mean concentration; or (b) 0.2 ppm (for HCl) or 3 ppm (for SO<E T="52">2</E>) absolute, whichever is less restrictive.</P>

            <P>11.9.3.2.6 If the criterion for single point sampling (5.0 percent, 0.2 ppm for HCl or 3 ppm for SO<E T="52">2</E> are not met, but the concentration at each traverse point differs from the mean concentration for all traverse points by no more than 10.0 percent of the mean, the gas stream is considered to be minimally stratified, and you may take RA samples using the “3-point short line”. Alternatively, you may use the 3-point short line if each traverse point differs from the mean value by no more than 0.4 ppm (for HCl) or 5 ppm (for SO<E T="52">2</E>).</P>
            <P>11.9.3.2.7 If the concentration at any traverse point differs from the mean concentration by more than 10 percent, the gas stream is considered stratified and you must sample using one of the options in section 11.9.3.2 above.</P>
            <P>11.9.3.3 Conduct all necessary RM tests within 3 cm (1.2 in.) of the traverse points, but no closer than 3 cm (1.2 in.) to the stack or duct wall.</P>
            <P>11.9.4 In order to correlate the CEMS and RM data properly, record the beginning and end of each RM run (including the time of day in hours, minutes, and seconds) using a clock synchronized with the CEM clock used to create a permanent time record with the CEMS output.</P>
            <P>11.9.5 You must conduct the RATA during representative process and control operating conditions or as specified in an applicable regulation, permit or subpart.</P>
            <P>11.9.6 Conduct a minimum of nine RM test runs. <E T="03">NOTE:</E> More than nine RM test runs may be performed. If this option is chosen, up to three test run results may be excluded so long as the total number of test run results used to determine the CEMS RA is greater than or equal to nine. However, all data must be reported including the excluded test runs.</P>
            <P>11.9.7 Analyze the results from the RM test runs using Equations 9-14 in section 12.6. Calculate the RA between the CEMS results and the RM.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11.10 Record Keeping and Reporting</HD>
            <P>11.10.1 For systems that use a liquid evaporative standard generator to deliver HCl reference gas standards, record supporting data for these devices, including liquid feed calibrations, liquid standard concentration(s) and NIST-traceability, feed rate and gas flow calibrations for all diluent and HCl gas flows. All calibrations must include a stated uncertainty, and the combined uncertainty of the delivered HCl reference gas concentration must be calculated and reported.</P>
            <P>11.10.2 Record the results of the CD test, the RT test, the ME test, the RA test, and for IP-CEMS, the results of the beam intensity, temperature and pressure verification procedures.

            <P>As used here, SA is a gas phase method of standard additions (either static or dynamic) used to verify the accuracy of CEMS measurements in the presence of the sample matrix. For extractive CEMS, it consists of spiking a known quantity of HCl dynamically into the measurement system as an addition to the native HCl and the native source gas matrix. For IP-CEMS, this procedure consists of introducing a known quantity of HCl into the optical path that also includes the native source gas.</P>

            </P>
            <P>7.0 <E T="03">Reagents and Standards.</E> SA materials must meet the requirements defined for reference gases in section 7 of PS-18 to perform this procedure with the following exception. You may use gases certified by the gas vendor to ±5 percent to perform the daily calibration drift assessment in section 4.1 of Procedure 6 in appendix F of this part.</P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>For extractive CEMS the concentrations of reference gases required for SA are likely to be significantly higher than the concentration of reference gases associated with PS-18 requirements.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <P>8.0 <E T="03">Standard Addition and Dynamic Spiking Procedure.</E> The standard addition procedure consists of measuring the native source gas concentration, addition of reference gas, and measurement of the resulting SA elevated source gas concentration. For extractive CEMS, HCl is spiked dynamically and thus, one must account for the dilution of sample gas from the addition of the HCl reference gas. For IP-CEMS, standard addition of an HCl reference gas is made by either adding an HCl reference gas to a flow through cell or inserting a sealed reference gas cell into the measurement path of the CEMS. The enclosed cell or a fixed cell must contain an HCl concentration that accounts for the difference in path length of the cell used for SA relative to the measurement path.</P>
            <P>8.1 SA Concentration and Measurement Replicates.</P>

            <P>8.1.1 You must inject HCl gas to create a measured concentration based on the requirements of the particular performance test (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> LOD verification, CD, DSA).</P>
            <P>8.1.2 Each dynamic spike (DS) or standard addition (SA) replicate consists of a measurement of the source emissions concentration of HCl (native stack concentration) with and without the addition of HCl. With a single CEMS, you must alternate the measurement of the native and SA-elevated source gas so that each measurement of SA-elevated source gas is immediately preceded and followed by a measurement of native stack gas. Introduce the SA gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Alternatively, you may use an independent continuous HCl monitor to measure the native source concentration before and after each standard addition as described in section 8.1.4.</P>
            <P>8.1.3 Unless specified otherwise by an applicable rule, your SA-elevated concentration may not exceed 100 percent of span when the SA and native HCl concentration are combined.</P>
            <P>8.1.4 As an alternative to making background measurements pre- and post-SA, you may use an independent continuous HCl monitor as a temporary unit to measure native stack HCl concentration while simultaneously using the CEMS to measure the SA-elevated source concentration. If you use an independent continuous HCl monitor you must make one concurrent background or native HCl measurement using both the installed CEMS and the independent continuous HCl monitor, immediately before the SA procedure in section 8.2 or 8.3 begins, to confirm that the independent monitoring system measures the same background concentration as the CEMS being qualified with this PS.</P>
            <P>8.2 SA Procedure for Extractive CEMS (Dynamic Spiking)</P>
            <P>8.2.1 Your HCl spike addition must not alter the total volumetric sample system flow rate or basic dilution ratio of your CEMS (if applicable).</P>
            <P>8.2.2 Your spike gas flow rate must not contribute more than 10 percent of the total volumetric flow rate through the CEMS.</P>

            <P>8.2.3 You must determine a dilution factor (DF) or relative concentration of HCl for each dynamic spike. Calibrated, NIST-traceable flow meters accurate to within 2.0 percent or highly accurate tracer gas measurements are required to make the necessary DF determinations at the accuracy required for this PS. Calibrated, NIST-traceable flow meters (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> venturi, orifice) accurate to within 2.0 percent should be recertified against an NIST-traceable flow meter annually. <E T="04">Note:</E> Since the spiking mass balance calculation is directly dependent on the accuracy of the DF determination, the accuracy of measurements required to determine the total volumetric gas flow rate, spike gas flow rate, or tracer gas standard addition concentration is critical to your ability to accurately perform the DS procedure and calculate the results.</P>
            <P>8.2.4 You must monitor and record the total sampling system flow rate and sample dilution factor (DF) for the spiking and stack gas sampling systems to ensure they are known and do not change during the spiking procedure. Record all data on a data sheet similar to Table A1 in section 13 of this appendix.</P>
            <P>8.2.4.1 You may either measure the spike gas flow and the total flow with calibrated flow meters capable of NIST traceable accuracy to ±2.0 percent or calculate the flow using a stable tracer gas included in your spike gas standard.</P>

            <P>8.2.4.2 If you use flow measurements to determine the spike dilution, then use Equation A1 in section 11.2.1 of this appendix to calculate the DF. Determination of the spike dilution requires measurement of HCl spike flow (Q<E T="52">spike</E>) and total flow through the CEM sampling system (Q<E T="52">probe</E>).</P>

            <P>8.2.4.3 If your CEMS is capable of measuring an independent stable tracer gas, you may use a spike gas that includes the tracer to determine the DF using Equation A2 or A3 (sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3 of this appendix) depending on whether the tracer gas is also present in the native source emissions.<PRTPAGE P="789"/>
            </P>
            <P>8.2.4.4 For extractive CEMS, you must correct the background measurements of HCl for the dilution caused by the addition of the spike gas standard. For spiking systems that alternate between addition of HCl and zero gas at a constant DF, the background measurements between spikes will not be equal to the native source concentration.</P>

            <P>8.2.5 Begin by collecting unspiked sample measurements of HCl. You must use the average of two unspiked sample measurements as your pre-spike background.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Measurements should agree within 5.0 percent or three times the level of detection to avoid biasing the spike results.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>8.2.5.1 Introduce the HCl gas spike into the permanent CEMS probe, upstream of the particulate filter or sample conditioning system and as close to the sampling inlet as practical.</P>
            <P>8.2.5.2 Maintain the HCl gas spike for at least twice the DS response time of your CEMS or until the consecutive measurements agree within 5.0 percent. Collect two independent measurements of the native plus spiked HCl concentration.</P>
            <P>8.2.5.3 Stop the flow of spike gas for at least twice the DS response time of your CEMS or until the consecutive measurements agree within 5.0 percent. Collect two independent measurements of the native HCl concentration.</P>
            <P>8.2.6 Repeat the collection of sample measurements in section 8.2.5 until you have data for each spike concentration including a final set of unspiked sample measurements according to section 8.2.5.3.</P>
            <P>8.2.7 Verify that the CEMS responded as expected for each spike gas injection, and that the data quality is not impacted by large shifts in the native source concentration. Discard and repeat any spike injections as necessary to generate a complete set of the required replicate spike measurements.</P>
            <P>8.2.8 Calculate the standard addition response (SAR) for extractive CEMS, using Equation A4 in section 11.2, of this appendix.</P>
            <P>8.2.9 If the DS results do not meet the specifications for the appropriate performance test in PS-18 or Procedure 6 of appendix F of this part, you must take corrective action and repeat the DS procedure.</P>
            <P>8.3 SA Procedure for IP-CEMS (Static Spiking).</P>
            <P>8.3.1 For IP-CEMS, you must make measurements of native source gas HCl concentration and an HCl standard addition using a calibration cell added to the optical measurement path.</P>
            <P>8.3.2 Introduce zero gas into a calibration cell located in the optical measurement path of the instrument. Continue to flush the zero gas into the cell for at least the SA response time of your CEMS or until two consecutive measurements taken are within 5.0 percent, then collect two independent measurements. Alternatively you may measure native concentrations without the calibration cell in the optical path.</P>
            <P>8.3.3 Introduce the HCl spike gas into the calibration cell. Continue to flush the spike gas into the cell for at least the SA response time of your CEMS or until two consecutive measurements taken are within 5.0 percent of one another. Then collect two independent measurements of the SA addition to the native concentration. Alternatively you may insert a sealed calibration cell, containing HCl at the appropriate concentration, into the optical path to measure the SA addition to the native concentration.</P>
            <P>8.3.4 Repeat the collection of SA-elevated and native HCl measurements in sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3 until you have data for each SA concentration. Then, make a final native HCl measurement. The measured concentrations must be corrected for calibration cell and stack temperature, pressure and stack measurement path length.</P>
            <P>8.3.5 Calculate the standard addition response (SAR) for an IP-CEMS, using Equation A8 in section 11.3 of this appendix.</P>
            <P>8.3.6 If the SA results do not meet the specifications for the appropriate performance test in PS-18 or Procedure 6 of appendix F of this part, you must take corrective action and repeat the SA procedure.</P>

            <P>1.1 The following method shall be used to determine whether a physical or operational change to an existing facility resulted in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere.

            <P>2.1 Each emission test shall consist of <E T="03">n</E> runs (usually three) which produce <E T="03">n</E> emission rates. Thus two sets of emission rates are generated, one before and one after the change, the two sets being of equal size.</P>
            <P>2.2 When using manual emission tests, except as provided in § 60.8(b) of this part, the reference methods of appendix A to this part shall be used in accordance with the procedures specified in the applicable subpart both before and after the change to obtain the data.</P>
            <P>2.3 When using continuous monitors, the facility shall be operated as if a manual emission test were being performed. Valid data using the averaging time which would be required if a manual emission test were being conducted shall be used.</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 60, App. F, Proc. 1</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Procedure 1. Quality Assurance Requirements for Gas Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Applicability and Principle</HD>

            <P>1.1 Applicability. Procedure 1 is used to evaluate the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures and the quality of data produced by any continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) that is used for determining compliance with the emission standards on a continuous basis as specified in the applicable regulation. The CEMS may include pollutant (e.g., S0<E T="52">2</E> and N0<E T="52">x</E>) and diluent (e.g., 0<E T="52">2</E> or C0<E T="52">2</E>) monitors.</P>
            <P>This procedure specifies the minimum QA requirements necessary for the control and assessment of the quality of CEMS data submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Source owners and operators responsible for one or more CEMS's used for compliance monitoring must meet these minimum requirements and are encouraged to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.</P>
            <P>Data collected as a result of QA and QC measures required in this procedure are to be submitted to the Agency. These data are to be used by both the Agency and the CEMS operator in assessing the effectiveness of the CEMS QC and QA procedures in the maintenance of acceptable CEMS operation and valid emission data.</P>
            <P>Appendix F, Procedure 1 is applicable December 4, 1987. The first CEMS accuracy assessment shall be a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) (see section 5) and shall be completed by March 4, 1988 or the date of the initial performance test required by the applicable regulation, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>1.2 Principle. The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the quality of the CEMS data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS data by implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions form a control loop: When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is inadequate, the control effort must be increased until the data quality is acceptable. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of data quality, this procedure explicitly specifies the assessment methods for response drift and accuracy. The methods are based on procedures included in the applicable performance specifications (PS's) in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. Procedure 1 also requires the analysis of the EPA audit samples concurrent with certain reference method (RM) analyses as specified in the applicable RM's.</P>
            <P>Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a variety of policies, specifications, standards, and corrective measures, this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow each source owner or operator to develop a QC system that is most effective and efficient for the circumstances.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Definitions</HD>
            <P>2.1 Continuous Emission Monitoring System. The total equipment required for the determination of a gas concentration or emission rate.</P>

            <P>2.2 Diluent Gas. A major gaseous constituent in a gaseous pollutant mixture. For combustion sources, CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> are the major gaseous constituents of interest.</P>
            <P>2.3 Span Value. The upper limit of a gas concentration measurement range that is specified for affected source categories in the applicable subpart of the regulation.</P>
            <P>2.4 Zero, Low-Level, and High-Level Values. The CEMS response values related to the source specific span value. Determination of zero, low-level, and high-level values is defined in the appropriate PS in appendix B of this part.</P>

            <P>2.5 Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the CEMS output reading from a reference value after a period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair or adjustment took place. The reference value may be supplied by a cylinder gas, gas cell, or optical filter and need not be certified.<PRTPAGE P="795"/>
            </P>
            <P>2.6 Relative Accuracy (RA). The absolute mean difference between the gas concentration or emission rate determined by the CEMS and the value determined by the RM's plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of tests divided by the mean of the RM tests or the applicable emission limit.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. QC Requirements</HD>
            <P>Each source owner or operator must develop and implement a QC program. As a minimum, each QC program must include written procedures which should describe in detail, complete, step-by-step procedures and operations for each of the following activities:</P>
            <P>1. Calibration of CEMS.</P>
            <P>2. CD determination and adjustment of CEMS.</P>
            <P>3. Preventive maintenance of CEMS (including spare parts inventory).</P>
            <P>4. Data recording, calculations, and reporting.</P>
            <P>5. Accuracy audit procedures including sampling and analysis methods.</P>
            <P>6. Program of corrective action for malfunctioning CEMS.</P>
            <P>As described in section 5.2, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, the source owner or operator must revise the current written procedures or modify or replace the CEMS to correct the deficiency causing the excessive inaccuracies.</P>
            <P>These written procedures must be kept on record and available for inspection by the enforcement agency.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. CD Assessment</HD>
            <P>4.1 CD Requirement. As described in 40 CFR 60.13(d), source owners and operators of CEMS must check, record, and quantify the CD at two concentration values at least once daily (approximately 24 hours) in accordance with the method prescribed by the manufacturer. The CEMS calibration must, as minimum, be adjusted whenever the daily zero (or low-level) CD or the daily high-level CD exceeds two times the limits of the applicable PS's in appendix B of this regulation.</P>
            <P>4.2 Recording Requirement for Automatic CD Adjusting Monitors. Monitors that automatically adjust the data to the corrected calibration values (e.g., microprocessor control) must be programmed to record the unadjusted concentration measured in the CD prior to resetting the calibration, if performed, or record the amount of adjustment.</P>
            <P>4.3 Criteria for Excessive CD. If either the zero (or low-level) or high-level CD result exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in appendix B for five, consecutive, daily periods, the CEMS is out-of-control. If either the zero (or low-level) or high-level CD result exceeds four times the applicable drift specification in appendix B during any CD check, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action. Following corrective action, repeat the CD checks.</P>
            <P>4.3.1 Out-Of-Control Period Definition. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the fifth, consecutive, daily CD check with a CD in excess of two times the allowable limit, or the time corresponding to the completion of the daily CD check preceding the daily CD check that results in a CD in excess of four times the allowable limit. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the CD check following corrective action that results in the CD's at both the zero (or low-level) and high-level measurement points being within the corresponding allowable CD limit (i.e., either two times or four times the allowable limit in appendix B).</P>
            <P>4.3.2 CEMS Data Status During Out-of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating emission compliance nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availability as required and described in the applicable subpart [e.g., § 60.47a(f)].</P>
            <P>4.4 Data Recording and Reporting. As required in § 60.7(d) of this regulation (40 CFR part 60), all measurements from the CEMS must be retained on file by the source owner for at least 2 years. However, emission data obtained on each successive day while the CEMS is out-of-control may not be included as part of the minimum daily data requirement of the applicable subpart [e.g., § 60.47a(f)] nor be used in the calculation of reported emissions for that period.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Data Accuracy Assessment</HD>
            <P>5.1 Auditing Requirements. Each CEMS must be audited at least once each calendar quarter. Successive quarterly audits shall occur no closer than 2 months. The audits shall be conducted as follows:</P>

            <P>5.1.1 Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). The RATA must be conducted at least once every four calendar quarters, except as otherwise noted in section 5.1.4 of this appendix. Conduct the RATA as described for the RA test procedure in the applicable PS in appendix B (e.g., PS 2 for SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E>). In addition, analyze the appropriate performance audit samples received from EPA as described in the applicable sampling methods (e.g., Methods 6 and 7).</P>
            <P>5.1.2 Cylinder Gas Audit (CGA). If applicable, a CGA may be conducted in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession.</P>

            <P>To conduct a CGA: (1) Challenge the CEMS (both pollutant and diluent portions of the CEMS, if applicable) with an audit gas of known concentration at two points within the following ranges:<PRTPAGE P="796"/>

            <P>Introduce each of the audit gases, three times each for a total of six challenges. Introduce the gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Do not introduce the same gas concentration twice in succession.</P>
            <P>Use of separate audit gas cylinder for audit points 1 and 2. Do not dilute gas from audit cylinder when challenging the CEMS.</P>
            <P>The monitor should be challenged at each audit point for a sufficient period of time to assure adsorption-desorption of the CEMS sample transport surfaces has stabilized.</P>
            <P>(2) Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode, i.e., pass the audit gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling, and as much of the sampling probe as is practical. At a minimum, the audit gas should be introduced at the connection between the probe and the sample line.</P>
            <P>(3) Use Certified Reference Materials (CRM's) (See Citation 1) audit gases that have been certified by comparison to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Materials (SRM's) or EPA Protocol Gases following the most recent edition of the EPA Traceability Protocol for Assay and Certification of Gaseous Calibration Standards (See Citation 2). Procedures for preparation of CRM's are described in Citation 1. Procedures for preparation of EPA Protocol Gases are described in Citation 2. In the case that a suitable audit gas level is not commercially available, Method 205 (See Citation 3) may be used to dilute CRM's or EPA Protocol Gases to the needed level. The difference between the actual concentration of the audit gas and the concentration indicated by the monitor is used to assess the accuracy of the CEMS.</P>
            <P>5.1.3 Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA). The RAA may be conducted three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession. To conduct a RAA, follow the procedure described in the applicable PS in appendix B for the relative accuracy test, except that only three sets of measurement data are required. Analyses of EPA performance audit samples are also required.</P>
            <P>The relative difference between the mean of the RM values and the mean of the CEMS responses will be used to assess the accuracy of the CEMS.</P>
            <P>5.1.4 Other Alternative Audits. Other alternative audit procedures may be used as approved by the Administrator for three of four calendar quarters. One RATA is required at least every four calendar quarters, except in the case where the affected facility is off-line (does not operate) in the fourth calendar quarter since the quarter of the previous RATA. In that case, the RATA shall be performed in the quarter in which the unit recommences operation. Also, cylinder gas audits are not be required for calendar quarters in which the affected facility does not operate.</P>
            <P>5.2 Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the RA, using the RATA, CGA, or RAA exceeds the criteria in section 5.2.3, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, the source owner or operator must audit the CEMS with a RATA, CGA, or RAA to determine if the CEMS is operating within the specifications. A RATA must always be used following an out-of-control period resulting from a RATA. The audit following corrective action does not require analysis of EPA performance audit samples. If audit results show the CEMS to be out-of-control, the CEMS operator shall report both the audit showing the CEMS to be out-of-control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing the CEMS to be operating within specifications.</P>
            <P>5.2.1 Out-Of-Control Period Definition. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling for the RATA, RAA, or CGA. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling of the subsequent successful audit.</P>
            <P>5.2.2 CEMS Data Status During Out-Of-Control Period. During the period the monitor is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating emission compliance nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availabilty as required and described in the applicable subpart [e.g., § 60.47a(f)].</P>
            <P>5.2.3 Criteria for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. Unless specified otherwise in the applicable subpart, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are:</P>
            <P>(1) For the RATA, the allowable RA in the applicable PS in appendix B.</P>
            <P>(2) For the CGA, ±15 percent of the average audit value or ±5 ppm, whichever is greater.</P>
            <P>(3) For the RAA, ±15 percent of the three run average or ±7.5 percent of the applicable standard, whichever is greater.</P>

            <P>5.3 Criteria for Acceptable QC Procedure. Repeated excessive inaccuracies (i.e., out-of-control conditions resulting from the quarterly audits) indicates the QC procedures are inadequate or that the CEMS is incapable of providing quality data. Therefore, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two <PRTPAGE P="797"/>consective quarters, the source owner or operator must revise the QC procedures (see section 3) or modify or replace the CEMS.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. Calculations for CEMS Data Accuracy</HD>
            <P>6.1 RATA RA Calculation. Follow the equations described in section 8 of appendix B, PS 2 to calculate the RA for the RATA. The RATA must be calculated in units of the applicable emission standard (e.g., ng/J).</P>
            <P>6.2 RAA Accuracy Calculation. Use the calculation procedure in the relevant performance specification to calculate the accuracy for the RAA. The RAA must be calculated in the units of the applicable emission standard.</P>

            <P>6.3 CGA Accuracy Calculation. Use Equation 1-1 to calculate the accuracy for the CGA, which is calculated in units of the appropriate concentration (e.g., ppm SO<E T="52">2</E> or percent O<E T="52">2</E>). Each component of the CEMS must meet the acceptable accuracy requirement.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Procedure 2—Quality Assurance Requirements for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 What Are the Purpose and Applicability of Procedure 2?</HD>

            <P>The purpose of Procedure 2 is to establish the minimum requirements for evaluating the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures and the quality of data produced by your particulate matter (PM) continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS). Procedure 2 applies to PM CEMS used for continuously determining compliance with emission standards or operating permit limits as specified in an applicable regulation or permit. Other QC procedures may apply to diluent (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> O<E T="52">2</E>) monitors and other auxiliary monitoring equipment included with your CEMS to facilitate PM measurement or determination of PM concentration in units specified in an applicable regulation.</P>
            <P>1.1 What measurement parameter does Procedure 2 address? Procedure 2 covers the instrumental measurement of PM as defined by your source's applicable reference method (no Chemical Abstract Service number assigned).</P>
            <P>1.2 For what types of devices must I comply with Procedure 2? You must comply with Procedure 2 for the total equipment that:</P>
            <P>(1) We require you to install and operate on a continuous basis under the applicable regulation, and</P>
            <P>(2) You use to monitor the PM mass concentration associated with the operation of a process or emission control device.</P>
            <P>1.3 What are the data quality objectives (DQOs) of Procedure 2? The overall DQO of Procedure 2 is the generation of valid, representative data that can be transferred into useful information for determining PM CEMS concentrations averaged over a prescribed interval. Procedure 2 is also closely associated with Performance Specification 11 (PS-11).</P>
            <P>(1) Procedure 2 specifies the minimum requirements for controlling and assessing the quality of PM CEMS data submitted to us or the delegated permitting authority.</P>
            <P>(2) You must meet these minimum requirements if you are responsible for one or more PM CEMS used for compliance monitoring. We encourage you to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.</P>

            <P>1.4 What is the intent of the QA/QC procedures specified in Procedure 2? Procedure 2 is intended to establish the minimum QA/QC requirements for PM CEMS and is presented in general terms to allow you to develop a <PRTPAGE P="799"/>program that is most effective for your circumstances. You may adopt QA/QC procedures that go beyond these minimum requirements to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.</P>
            <P>1.5 When must I comply with Procedure 2? You must comply with the basic requirements of Procedure 2 immediately following successful completion of the initial correlation test of PS-11.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 What Are the Basic Requirements of Procedure 2?</HD>
            <P>Procedure 2 requires you to perform periodic evaluations of PM CEMS performance and to develop and implement QA/QC programs to ensure that PM CEMS data quality is maintained.</P>
            <P>2.1 What are the basic functions of Procedure 2?</P>
            <P>(1) Assessment of the quality of your PM CEMS data by estimating measurement accuracy;</P>
            <P>(2) Control and improvement of the quality of your PM CEMS data by implementing QC requirements and corrective actions until the data quality is acceptable; and</P>
            <P>(3) Specification of requirements for daily instrument zero and upscale drift checks and daily sample volume checks, as well as routine response correlation audits, absolute correlation audits, sample volume audits, and relative response audits.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 What Special Definitions Apply to Procedure 2?</HD>
            <P>The definitions in Procedure 2 include those provided in PS-11 of Appendix B, with the following additions:</P>

            <P>3.1 “Absolute Correlation Audit (ACA)” means an evaluation of your PM CEMS response to a series of reference standards covering the full measurement range of the instrument (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 4 mA to 20 mA).</P>
            <P>3.2 “Correlation Range” means the range of PM CEMS responses used in the complete set of correlation test data.</P>

            <P>3.3 “PM CEMS Correlation” means the site-specific relationship (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a regression equation) between the output from your PM CEMS (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mA) and the particulate concentration, as determined by the reference method. The PM CEMS correlation is expressed in the same units as the PM concentration measured by your PM CEMS (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mg/acm). You must derive this relation from PM CEMS response data and manual reference method data that were gathered simultaneously. These data must be representative of the full range of source and control device operating conditions that you expect to occur. You must develop the correlation by performing the steps presented in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of PS-11.</P>
            <P>3.4 “Reference Method Sampling Location” means the location in your source's exhaust duct from which you collect manual reference method data for developing your PM CEMS correlation and for performing relative response audits (RRAs) and response correlation audits (RCAs).</P>
            <P>3.5 “Response Correlation Audit (RCA)” means the series of tests specified in section 10.3(8) of this procedure that you conduct to ensure the continued validity of your PM CEMS correlation.</P>
            <P>3.6 “Relative Response Audit (RRA)” means the brief series of tests specified in section 10.3(6) of this procedure that you conduct between consecutive RCAs to ensure the continued validity of your PM CEMS correlation.</P>
            <P>3.7 “Sample Volume Audit (SVA)” means an evaluation of your PM CEMS measurement of sample volume if your PM CEMS determines PM concentration based on a measure of PM mass in an extracted sample volume and an independent determination of sample volume.</P>

            </HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 What Do I Need To Know To Ensure the Safety of Persons Using Procedure 2?</HD>
            <P>People using Procedure 2 may be exposed to hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. Procedure 2 does not purport to address all of the safety issues associated with its use. It is your responsibility to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations before performing this procedure. You must consult your CEMS user's manual for specific precautions to be taken with regard to your PM CEMS procedures.</P>

            <P>You will need reference standards or procedures to perform the zero drift check, the upscale drift check, and the sample volume check.</P>
            <P>7.1 What is the reference standard value for the zero drift check? You must use a zero check value that is no greater than 20 percent of the PM CEMS's response range. You must obtain documentation on the zero check value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.</P>

            <P>7.2 What is the reference standard value for the upscale drift check? You must use an upscale check value that produces a response between 50 and 100 percent of the PM CEMS's response range. For a PM CEMS that produces output over a range of 4 mA to 20 mA, the upscale check value must produce a response in the range of 12 mA to 20 mA. You must obtain documentation on the upscale check value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.<PRTPAGE P="800"/>
            </P>
            <P>7.3 What is the reference standard value for the sample volume check? You must use a reference standard value or procedure that produces a sample volume value equivalent to the normal sampling rate. You must obtain documentation on the sample volume value from your PM CEMS manufacturer.</P>

            </HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.0 What Quality Control Measures Are Required by This Procedure for My PM CEMS?</HD>
            <P>You must develop and implement a QC program for your PM CEMS. Your QC program must, at a minimum, include written procedures that describe, in detail, complete step-by-step procedures and operations for the activities in paragraphs (1) through (8) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) Procedures for performing drift checks, including both zero drift and upscale drift and the sample volume check (see sections 10.2(1), (2), and (5)).</P>
            <P>(2) Methods for adjustment of PM CEMS based on the results of drift checks, sample volume checks (if applicable), and the periodic audits specified in this procedure.</P>
            <P>(3) Preventative maintenance of PM CEMS (including spare parts inventory and sampling probe integrity).</P>
            <P>(4) Data recording, calculations, and reporting.</P>
            <P>(5) RCA and RRA procedures, including sampling and analysis methods, sampling strategy, and structuring test conditions over the prescribed range of PM concentrations.</P>
            <P>(6) Procedures for performing ACAs and SVAs and methods for adjusting your PM CEMS response based on ACA and SVA results.</P>
            <P>(7) Program of corrective action for malfunctioning PM CEMS, including flagged data periods.</P>
            <P>(8) For extractive PM CEMS, procedures for checking extractive system ducts for material accumulation.</P>
            <P>9.1 What QA/QC documentation must I have? You are required to keep the written QA/QC procedures on record and available for inspection by us, the State, and/or local enforcement agency for the life of your CEMS or until you are no longer subject to the requirements of this procedure.</P>

            <P>9.2 How do I know if I have acceptable QC procedures for my PM CEMS? Your QC procedures are inadequate or your PM CEMS is incapable of providing quality data if you fail two consecutive QC audits (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> out-of-control conditions resulting from the annual audits, quarterly audits, or daily checks). Therefore, if you fail the same two consecutive audits, you must revise your QC procedures or modify or replace your PM CEMS to correct the deficiencies causing the excessive inaccuracies (see section 10.4 for limits for excessive audit inaccuracy).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 What Calibration/Correlation and Standardization Procedures Must I Perform for My PM CEMS?</HD>
            <P>You must generate a site-specific correlation for each of your PM CEMS installation(s) relating response from your PM CEMS to results from simultaneous PM reference method testing. The PS-11 defines procedures for developing the correlation and defines a series of statistical parameters for assessing acceptability of the correlation. However, a critical component of your PM CEMS correlation process is ensuring the accuracy and precision of reference method data. The activities listed in sections 10.1 through 10.10 assure the quality of the correlation.</P>
            <P>10.1 When should I use paired trains for reference method testing? Although not required, we recommend that you should use paired-train reference method testing to generate data used to develop your PM CEMS correlation and for RCA testing. Guidance on the use of paired sampling trains can be found in the PM CEMS Knowledge Document (see section 16.5 of PS-11).</P>
            <P>10.2 What routine system checks must I perform on my PM CEMS? You must perform routine checks to ensure proper operation of system electronics and optics, light and radiation sources and detectors, and electric or electro-mechanical systems. Necessary components of the routine system checks will depend on design details of your PM CEMS. As a minimum, you must verify the system operating parameters listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section on a daily basis. Some PM CEMS may perform one or more of these functions automatically or as an integral portion of unit operations; for other PM CEMS, you must initiate or perform one or more of these functions manually.</P>
            <P>(1) You must check the zero drift to ensure stability of your PM CEMS response to the zero check value. You must determine system output on the most sensitive measurement range when the PM CEMS is challenged with a zero reference standard or procedure. You must, at a minimum, adjust your PM CEMS whenever the daily zero drift exceeds 4 percent.</P>
            <P>(2) You must check the upscale drift to ensure stability of your PM CEMS response to the upscale check value. You must determine system output when the PM CEMS is challenged with a reference standard or procedure corresponding to the upscale check value. You must, at a minimum, adjust your PM CEMS whenever the daily upscale drift check exceeds 4 percent.</P>

            <P>(3) For light-scattering and extinction-type PM CEMS, you must check the system optics to ensure that system response has not <PRTPAGE P="801"/>been altered by the condition of optical components, such as fogging of lens and performance of light monitoring devices.</P>

            <P>(4) You must record data from your automatic drift-adjusting PM CEMS before any adjustment is made. If your PM CEMS automatically adjusts its response to the corrected calibration values (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> microprocessor control), you must program your PM CEMS to record the unadjusted concentration measured in the drift check before resetting the calibration. Alternately, you may program your PM CEMS to record the amount of adjustment.</P>
            <P>(5) For extractive PM CEMS that measure the sample volume and use the measured sample volume as part of calculating the output value, you must check the sample volume on a daily basis to verify the accuracy of the sample volume measuring equipment. This sample volume check must be done at the normal sampling rate of your PM CEMS. You must adjust your PM CEMS sample volume measurement whenever the daily sample volume check error exceeds 10 percent.</P>
            <P>10.3 What are the auditing requirements for my PM CEMS? You must subject your PM CEMS to an ACA and an SVA, as applicable, at least once each calendar quarter. Successive quarterly audits must occur no closer than 2 months apart. You must conduct an RCA and an RRA at the frequencies specified in the applicable regulation or facility operating permit. An RRA or RCA conducted during any calendar quarter can take the place of the ACA required for that calendar quarter. An RCA conducted during the period in which an RRA is required can take the place of the RRA for that period.</P>
            <P>(1) When must I perform an ACA? You must perform an ACA each quarter unless you conduct an RRA or RCA during that same quarter.</P>
            <P>(2) How do I perform an ACA? You perform an ACA according to the procedure specified in paragraphs (2)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) You must challenge your PM CEMS with an audit standard or an equivalent audit reference to reproduce the PM CEMS's measurement at three points within the following ranges:</P>

            <P>(v) Use the difference between the actual known value of the audit standard and the response of your PM CEMS to assess the accuracy of your PM CEMS.</P>

            <P>(3) When must I perform an SVA? You must perform an audit of the measured sample volume (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the sampling flow rate for a known time) once per quarter for applicable PM CEMS with an extractive sampling system. Also, you must perform and pass an SVA prior to initiation of any of the reference method data collection runs for an RCA or RRA.</P>
            <P>(4) How do I perform an SVA? You perform an SVA according to the procedure specified in paragraphs (4)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) You perform an SVA by independently measuring the volume of sample gas extracted from the stack or duct over each batch cycle or time period with a calibrated device. You may make this measurement either at the inlet or outlet of your PM CEMS, so long as it measures the sample gas volume without including any dilution or recycle air. Compare the measured volume with the volume reported by your PM CEMS for the same cycle or time period to calculate sample volume accuracy.</P>

            <P>(ii) You must make measurements during three sampling cycles for batch extractive monitors (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Beta-gauge) or during three periods of at least 20 minutes for continuous extractive PM CEMS.</P>

            <P>(iii) You may need to condense, collect, and measure moisture from the sample gas prior to the calibrated measurement device (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> dry gas meter) and correct the results for moisture content. In any case, the volumes measured by the calibrated device and your PM CEMS must be on a consistent temperature, pressure, and moisture basis.</P>
            <P>(5) How often must I perform an RRA? You must perform an RRA at the frequency specified in the applicable regulation or facility operating permit. You may conduct an RCA instead of an RRA during the period when the RRA is required.</P>
            <P>(6) How do I perform an RRA? You must perform the RRA according to the procedure specified in paragraphs (6)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>

            <P>(i) You perform an RRA by collecting three simultaneous reference method PM concentration measurements and PM CEMS measurements at the as-found source operating conditions and PM concentration.<PRTPAGE P="802"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) We recommend that you use paired trains for reference method sampling. Guidance on the use of paired sampling trains can be found in the PM CEMS Knowledge Document (see section 16.5 of PS-11).</P>
            <P>(7) How often must I perform an RCA? You must perform an RCA at the frequency specified in the applicable regulation or facility operating permit.</P>
            <P>(8) How do I perform an RCA? You must perform the RCA according to the procedures for the PM CEMS correlation test described in PS-11, section 8.6, except that the minimum number of runs required is 12 in the RCA instead of 15 as specified in PS-11.</P>
            <P>(9) What other alternative audits can I use? You can use other alternative audit procedures as approved by us, the State, or local agency for the quarters when you would conduct ACAs.</P>
            <P>10.4 What are my limits for excessive audit inaccuracy? Unless specified otherwise in the applicable subpart, the criteria for excessive audit inaccuracy are listed in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) What are the criteria for excessive zero or upscale drift? Your PM CEMS is out of control if the zero drift check or upscale drift check either exceeds 4 percent for five consecutive daily periods or exceeds 8 percent for any one day.</P>
            <P>(2) What are the criteria for excessive sample volume measurement error? Your PM CEMS is out of control if sample volume check error exceeds 10 percent for five consecutive daily periods or exceeds 20 percent for any one day.</P>
            <P>(3) What are the criteria for excessive ACA error? Your PM CEMS is out of control if the results of any ACA exceed ±10 percent of the average audit value, as calculated using Equation 2-1a, or 7.5 percent of the applicable standard, as calculated using Equation 2-1b, whichever is greater.</P>
            <P>(4) What is the criterion for excessive SVA error? Your PM CEMS is out of control if results exceed ±5 percent of the average sample volume audit value.</P>
            <P>(5) What are the criteria for passing a RCA? To pass a RCA, you must meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (5)(i) and (ii) of this section. If your PM CEMS fails to meet these RCA criteria, it is out of control.</P>
            <P>(i) For all 12 data points, the PM CEMS response value can be no greater than the greatest PM CEMS response value used to develop your correlation curve.</P>
            <P>(ii) At least 75 percent of a minimum number of 12 sets of PM CEMS and reference method measurements must fall within a specified area on a graph of the correlation regression line. The specified area on the graph of the correlation regression line is defined by two lines parallel to the correlation regression line, offset at a distance of ±25 percent of the numerical emission limit value from the correlation regression line. If any of the PM CEMS response values resulting from your RCA are lower than the lowest PM CEMS response value of your existing correlation curve, you may extend your correlation regression line to the point corresponding to the lowest PM CEMS response value obtained during the RCA. This extended correlation regression line must then be used to determine if the RCA data meets this criterion.</P>
            <P>(6) What are the criteria to pass a RRA? To pass a RRA, you must meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (6)(i) and (ii) of this section. If your PM CEMS fails to meet these RRA criteria, it is out of control.</P>
            <P>(i) For all three data points, the PM CEMS response value can be no greater than the greatest PM CEMS response value used to develop your correlation curve.</P>
            <P>(ii) At least two of the three sets of PM CEMS and reference method measurements must fall within the same specified area on a graph of the correlation regression line as required for the RCA and described in paragraph (5)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>10.5 What do I do if my PM CEMS is out of control? If your PM CEMS is out of control, you must take the actions listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) You must take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem and perform tests, as appropriate, to ensure that the corrective action was successful.</P>
            <P>(i) Following corrective action, you must repeat the previously failed audit to confirm that your PM CEMS is operating within the specifications.</P>
            <P>(ii) If your PM CEMS failed an RRA, you must take corrective action until your PM CEMS passes the RRA criteria. If the RRA criteria cannot be achieved, you must perform an RCA.</P>
            <P>(iii) If your PM CEMS failed an RCA, you must follow procedures specified in section 10.6 of this procedure.</P>
            <P>(2) You must report both the audit showing your PM CEMS to be out of control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing your PM CEMS to be operating within specifications.</P>
            <P>10.6 What do I do if my PM CEMS fails an RCA? After an RCA failure, you must take all applicable actions listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section.</P>

            <P>(1) Combine RCA data with data from the active PM CEMS correlation and perform the mathematical evaluations defined in PS-11 for development of a PM CEMS correlation, including examination of alternate correlation models (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> linear, polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, and power). If the expanded data base and revised correlation meet PS-11 statistical criteria, use the revised correlation.</P>

            <P>(2) If the criteria specified in paragraph (1) of this section are not achieved, you must develop a new PM CEMS correlation based <PRTPAGE P="803"/>on revised data. The revised data set must consist of the test results from only the RCA. The new data must meet all requirements of PS-11 to develop a revised PM CEMS correlation, except that the minimum number of sets of PM CEMS and reference method measurements is 12 instead of the minimum of 15 sets required by PS-11. Your PM CEMS is considered to be back in controlled status when the revised correlation meets all of the performance criteria specified in section 13.2 of PS-11.</P>
            <P>(3) If the actions in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section do not result in an acceptable correlation, you must evaluate the cause(s) and comply with the actions listed in paragraphs (3)(i) through (iv) of this section within 90 days after the completion of the failed RCA.</P>
            <P>(i) Completely inspect your PM CEMS for mechanical or operational problems. If you find a mechanical or operational problem, repair your PM CEMS and repeat the RCA.</P>
            <P>(ii) You may need to relocate your PM CEMS to a more appropriate measurement location. If you relocate your PM CEMS, you must perform a new correlation test according to the procedures specified in PS-11.</P>
            <P>(iii) The characteristics of the PM or gas in your source's flue gas stream may have changed such that your PM CEMS measurement technology is no longer appropriate. If this is the case, you must install a PM CEMS with measurement technology that is appropriate for your source's flue gas characteristics. You must perform a new correlation test according to the procedures specified in PS-11.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the corrective actions in paragraphs (3)(i) through (iii) of this section were not successful, you must petition us, the State, or local agency for approval of alternative criteria or an alternative for continuous PM monitoring.</P>
            <P>10.7 When does the out-of-control period begin and end? The out-of-control period begins immediately after the last test run or check of an unsuccessful RCA, RRA, ACA, SVA, drift check, or sample volume check. The out-of-control period ends immediately after the last test run or check of the subsequent successful audit or drift check.</P>
            <P>10.8 Can I use the data recorded by my PM CEMS during out-of-control periods? During any period when your PM CEMS is out of control, you may not use your PM CEMS data to calculate emission compliance or to meet minimum data availability requirements described in the applicable regulation.</P>
            <P>10.9 What are the QA/QC reporting requirements for my PM CEMS? You must report the accuracy results for your PM CEMS, specified in section 10.4 of this procedure, at the interval specified in the applicable regulation. Report the drift and accuracy information as a Data Assessment Report (DAR), and include one copy of this DAR for each quarterly audit with the report of emissions required under the applicable regulation. An example DAR is provided in Procedure 1, Appendix F of this part.</P>
            <P>10.10 What minimum information must I include in my DAR? As a minimum, you must include the information listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section in the DAR:</P>
            <P>(1) Your name and address.</P>
            <P>(2) Identification and location of monitors in your CEMS.</P>
            <P>(3) Manufacturer and model number of each monitor in your CEMS.</P>
            <P>(4) Assessment of PM CEMS data accuracy/acceptability, and date of assessment, as determined by an RCA, RRA, ACA, or SVA described in section 10, including the acceptability determination for the RCA or RRA, the accuracy for the ACA or SVA, the reference method results, the audit standards, your PM CEMS responses, and the calculation results as defined in section 12. If the accuracy audit results show your PM CEMS to be out of control, you must report both the audit results showing your PM CEMS to be out of control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing your PM CEMS to be operating within specifications.</P>
            <P>(5) Summary of all corrective actions you took when you determined your PM CEMS to be out of control, as described in section 10.5, or after failing on RCA, as described in section 10.6.</P>
            <P>10.7 Where and how long must I retain the QA data that this procedure requires me to record for my PM CEMS? You must keep the records required by this procedure for your PM CEMS onsite and available for inspection by us, the State, and/or local enforcement agency for a period of 5 years.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Procedure 3—Quality Assurance Requirements for Continuous Opacity Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 What are the purpose and applicability of Procedure 3?</HD>
            <P>The purpose of Procedure 3 is to establish quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures for continuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS). Procedure 3 applies to COMS used to demonstrate continuous compliance with opacity standards specified in new source performance standards (NSPS) promulgated by EPA pursuant to section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7411(b)—Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources.</P>
            <P>1.1 <E T="03">What are the data quality objectives of Procedure 3?</E> The overall data quality objective (DQO) of Procedure 3 is the generation of valid and representative opacity data. Procedure 3 specifies the minimum requirements for controlling and assessing the quality of COMS data submitted to us or the delegated regulatory agency. Procedure 3 requires you to perform periodic evaluations of a COMS performance and to develop and implement QA/QC programs to ensure that COMS data quality is maintained.</P>
            <P>1.2 <E T="03">What is the intent of the QA/QC procedures specified in Procedure 3?</E> Procedure 3 is intended to establish the minimum QA/QC requirements to verify and maintain an acceptable level of quality of the data produced by COMS. It is presented in general terms to allow you to develop a program that is most effective for your circumstances.</P>
            <P>1.3 <E T="03">When must I comply with Procedure 3?</E> You must comply with Procedure 3 no later than November 12, 2014.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 What are the basic functions of Procedure 3?</HD>
            <P>The basic functions of Procedure 3 are assessment of the quality of your COMS data and control and improvement of the quality of the data by implementing QC requirements and corrective actions. Procedure 3 provides requirements for:</P>
            <P>(1) Daily instrument zero and upscale drift checks and status indicators checks;</P>
            <P>(2) Quarterly performance audits which include the following assessments:</P>
            <P>(i) Optical alignment,</P>
            <P>(ii) Calibration error, and</P>
            <P>(iii) Zero compensation.
            </P>
            <FP>Sources that achieve quality assured data for four consecutive quarters may reduce their auditing frequency to semi-annual. If a performance audit is failed, the source must resume quarterly testing for that audit requirement until it again demonstrates successful performance over four consecutive quarters.</FP>
            <P>(3) Annual zero alignment.
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 What special definitions apply to Procedure 3?</HD>
            <P>The definitions in Procedure 3 include those provided in Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) of Appendix B of this part and ASTM D6216-12 and the following additional definitions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">3.1 Out-of-control periods.</E> Out-of-control periods mean that one or more COMS parameters falls outside of the acceptable limits established by this rule.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Daily Assessments.</E> Whenever the calibration drift (CD) exceeds twice the specification of PS-1, the COMS is out-of-control. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the daily calibration drift check. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of appropriate adjustment and subsequent successful CD assessment.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Quarterly and Annual Assessments.</E> Whenever an annual zero alignment or quarterly performance audit fails to meet the criteria established in paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 10.4, the COMS is out-of-control. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the performance audit indicating the failure to meet these established criteria. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of appropriate corrective actions and the subsequent successful audit (or, if applicable, partial audit).<PRTPAGE P="806"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 What interferences must I avoid?</HD>
            <P>Opacity cannot be measured accurately in the presence of condensed water vapor. Thus, COMS opacity compliance determinations cannot be made when condensed water vapor is present, such as downstream of a wet scrubber without a reheater or at other saturated flue gas locations. Therefore, COMS must be located where condensed water vapor is not present.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 What do I need to know to ensure the safety of persons using Procedure 3?</HD>
            <P>Those implementing Procedure 3 may be exposed to hazardous materials, operations and equipment. Procedure 3 does not purport to address all of the safety issues associated with its use. It is your responsibility to establish appropriate health and safety practices and determine the applicable regulatory limitations before performing this procedure. You should consult the COMS user's manual for specific precautions to take.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 What equipment and supplies do I need?</HD>
            <P>The equipment and supplies that you need are specified in PS-1. You are not required to purchase a new COMS if your existing COMS meets the requirements specified in Procedure 3.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.0 What reagents and standards do I need?</HD>
            <P>The reagents and standards that you need are specified in PS-1. You are not required to purchase a new COMS if your existing COMS meets the requirements specified in Procedure 3.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.0 What quality control measures are required by this procedure for my COMS?</HD>
            <P>You must develop and implement a QC program for your COMS. Your QC program must, at a minimum, include written procedures which describe in detail complete step-by-step procedures and operations for the activities in paragraphs (1) through (4):</P>
            <P>(1) Procedures for performing drift checks, including both zero and upscale drift and the status indicators check,</P>
            <P>(2) Procedures for performing quarterly performance audits,</P>
            <P>(3) A means of checking the zero alignment of the COMS, and</P>
            <P>(4) A program of corrective action for a malfunctioning COMS. The corrective action must include, at a minimum, the requirements specified in section 10.5.</P>
            <P>9.1 <E T="03">What QA/QC documentation must I have?</E> You are required to keep the QA/QC written procedures required in section 9.0 on site and available for inspection by us, the state, and/or local enforcement agencies.</P>
            <P>9.2 <E T="03">What actions must I take if I fail QC audits?</E> If you fail two consecutive annual audits, two consecutive quarterly audits, or five consecutive daily checks, you must either revise your QC procedures or determine if your COMS is malfunctioning. If you determine that your COMS is malfunctioning, you must take the necessary corrective action as specified in section 10.5. If you determine that your COMS requires extensive repairs, you may use a substitute COMS provided the substitute meets the requirements in section 10.6.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.0 What calibration and standardization procedures must I perform for my COMS?</HD>
            <P>(1) You must perform daily system checks to ensure proper operation of system electronics and optics, light and radiation sources and detectors, electric or electro-mechanical systems, and general stability of the system calibration. Daily is defined as any portion of a calendar day in which a unit operates.</P>
            <P>(2) You must subject your COMS to a performance audit to include checks of the individual COMS components and factors affecting the accuracy of the monitoring data at least once per QA operating quarter. A QA operating quarter is a calendar quarter in which a unit operates at least 168 hours.</P>
            <P>(3) At least annually, you must perform a zero alignment by comparing the COMS simulated zero to the actual clear path zero. Annually is defined as a period wherein the unit is operating at least 28 days in a calendar year. The simulated zero device produces a simulated clear path condition or low-level opacity condition, where the energy reaching the detector is between 90 and 110 percent of the energy reaching the detector under actual clear path conditions.</P>
            <P>10.1 <E T="03">What daily system checks must I perform on my COMS?</E> The specific components required to undergo daily system checks will depend on the design details of your COMS. At a minimum, you must verify the system operating parameters listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section. Some COMS may perform one or more of these functions automatically or as an integral portion of unit operations; other COMS may perform one or more of these functions manually.</P>

            <P>(1) You must check the zero drift to ensure stability of your COMS response to the simulated zero device. The simulated zero device, an automated mechanism within the transmissometer that produces a simulated clear path condition or low-level opacity condition, is used to check the zero drift. You must, at a minimum, take corrective action on your COMS whenever the daily zero drift exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in section 13.3(6) of PS-1.<PRTPAGE P="807"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) You must check the upscale drift to ensure stability of your COMS response to the upscale drift value. The upscale calibration device, an automated mechanism (employing an attenuator or reduced reflectance device) within the transmissometer that produces an upscale opacity value is used to check the upscale drift. You must, at a minimum, take corrective action on your COMS whenever the daily upscale drift check exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in section 13.3(6) of PS-1.</P>
            <P>(3) You must, at a minimum, check the status indicators, data acquisition system error messages, and other system self-diagnostic indicators. You must take appropriate corrective action based on the manufacturer's recommendations when the COMS is operating outside preset limits.</P>
            <P>10.2 <E T="03">What are the quarterly auditing requirements for my COMS?</E> At a minimum, the parameters listed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section must be included in the performance audit conducted on a quarterly basis as defined in section 10.0(2).</P>
            <P>(1) For units with automatic zero compensation, you must determine the zero compensation for the COMS. The value of the zero compensation applied at the time of the audit must be calculated as equivalent opacity and corrected to stack exit conditions according to the procedures specified by the manufacturer. The compensation applied to the effluent by the monitor system must be recorded.</P>
            <P>(2) You must conduct a three-point calibration error test of the COMS. Three calibration attenuators, either primary or secondary must meet the requirements of PS-1, with one exception. Instead of recalibrating the attenuators semi-annually, they must be recalibrated annually. If two annual calibrations agree within 0.5 percent opacity, the attenuators may then be calibrated once every five years. The three attenuators must be placed in the COMS light beam path for at least three nonconsecutive readings. All monitor responses must then be independently recorded from the COMS permanent data recorder. Additional guidance for conducting this test is included in section 8.1(3)(ii) of PS-1. The low-, mid-, and high-range calibration error results must be computed as the mean difference and 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the expected and actual responses of the monitor as corrected to stack exit conditions. The equations necessary to perform the calculations are found in section 12.0 of PS-1. For the calibration error test method, you must use the external audit device. When the external audit device is installed, with no calibration attenuator inserted, the COMS measurement reading must be less than or equal to one percent opacity. You must also document procedures for properly handling and storing the external audit device and calibration attenuators within your written QC program.</P>
            <P>(3) You must check the optical alignment of the COMS in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's recommendations. If the optical alignment varies with stack temperature, perform the optical alignment test when the unit is operating.</P>
            <P>10.3 <E T="03">What are the annual auditing requirements for my COMS?</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) You must perform the primary zero alignment method under clear path conditions. The COMS must be removed from its installation and set up under clear path conditions. There must be no adjustments to the monitor other than the establishment of the proper monitor path length and correct optical alignment of the COMS components. You must record the COMS response to a clear condition and to the COMS's simulated zero condition as percent opacity corrected to stack exit conditions. For a COMS with automatic zero compensation, you must disconnect or disable the zero compensation mechanism or record the amount of correction applied to the COMS's simulated zero condition. The response difference in percent opacity to the clear path and simulated zero conditions must be recorded as the zero alignment error. You must adjust the COMS's simulated zero device to provide the same response as the clear path condition as specified in paragraph (3) of section 10.0.</P>

            <P>(2) As an alternative, monitors capable of allowing the installation of an external zero device may use the device for the zero alignment provided that: (1) The external zero device setting has been established for the monitor path length and recorded for the specific COMS by comparison of the COMS responses to the installed external zero device and to the clear path condition, and (2) the external zero device is demonstrated to be capable of producing a consistent zero response when it is repeatedly (i.e., three consecutive installations and removals prior to conducting the final zero alignment check) installed on the COMS. This can be demonstrated by either the manufacturer's certificate of conformance (MCOC) or actual on-site performance. The external zero device setting must be permanently set at the time of initial zeroing to the clear path zero value and protected when not in use to ensure that the setting equivalent to zero opacity does not change. The external zero device response must be checked and recorded prior to initiating the zero alignment. If the external zero device setting has changed, you must remove the COMS from the stack in order to reset the external zero device. If you employ an external zero device, you must perform the zero alignment audits with the COMS off the stack at least every three years. If the external zero device is adjusted within the three-year period, you must perform the zero alignment with the COMS off <PRTPAGE P="808"/>the stack no later than three years from the date of adjustment.</P>

            <P>10.4 <E T="03">What are my limits for excessive audit inaccuracy?</E> Unless specified otherwise in the applicable subpart, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are listed in paragraphs (1) through (4).</P>
            <P>(1) What is the criterion for excessive zero or upscale drift? Your COMS is out-of-control if either the zero drift check or upscale drift check exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in PS-1 for any one day.</P>
            <P>(2) What is the criterion for excessive zero alignment? Your COMS is out-of-control if the zero alignment error exceeds 2 percent opacity.</P>
            <P>(3) What is the criterion to pass the quarterly performance audit? Your COMS is out-of-control if the results of a quarterly performance audit indicate noncompliance with the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) The optical alignment indicator does not show proper alignment (i.e., does not fall within a specific reference mark or condition).</P>
            <P>(ii) The zero compensation exceeds 4 percent opacity, or</P>
            <P>(iii) The calibration error exceeds 3 percent opacity.</P>
            <P>(4) What is the criterion for data capture? You must adhere to the data capture criterion specified in the applicable subpart.</P>
            <P>10.5 <E T="03">What corrective action must I take if my COMS is malfunctioning?</E> You must have a corrective action program in place to address the repair and/or maintenance of your COMS. The corrective action program must address routine/preventative maintenance and various types of analyzer repairs. The corrective action program must establish what diagnostic testing must be performed after each type of activity to ensure that the COMS is collecting valid, quality-assured data. Recommended maintenance and repair procedures and diagnostic testing after repairs may be found in an associated guidance document.</P>
            <P>10.6 <E T="03">What requirements must I meet if I use a temporary opacity monitor?</E>
            </P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Procedure 5. Quality Assurance Requirements for Vapor Phase Mercury Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems and Sorbent Trap Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination at Stationary Sources</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Applicability and Principle</HD>
            <P>1.1 Applicability. The purpose of Procedure 5 is to establish the minimum requirements for evaluating the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures as well as the quality of data produced by vapor phase mercury (Hg) continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) and sorbent trap monitoring systems. Procedure 5 applies to Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems used for continuously determining compliance with emission standards or operating permit limits as specified in an applicable regulation or permit. Other QA/QC procedures may apply to other auxiliary monitoring equipment that may be needed to determine Hg emissions in the units of measure specified in an applicable permit or regulation.</P>

            <P>Procedure 5 covers the measurement of Hg emissions as defined in Performance Specification 12A (PS 12A) and Performance Specification 12B (PS 12B) in appendix B to this part, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> total vapor phase Hg representing the sum of the elemental (Hg°, CAS Number 7439-97-6) and oxidized (Hg<E T="51">+2</E>) forms of gaseous Hg.</P>
            <P>Procedure 5 specifies the minimum requirements for controlling and assessing the quality of Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring system data submitted to EPA or a delegated permitting authority. You must meet these minimum requirements if you are responsible for one or more Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring systems used for compliance monitoring. We encourage you to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.</P>
            <P>You must comply with the basic requirements of Procedure 5 immediately following successful completion of the initial performance test described in PS 12A or PS 12B in appendix B to this part (as applicable).</P>

            <P>1.2 Principle. The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the quality of the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system data by implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions form a control loop: When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is inadequate, the quality control effort must be increased until the data quality is acceptable. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of data quality, this procedure explicitly specifies assessment methods for calibration drift, system integrity, and accuracy. Several of the procedures are based on those of PS 12A and PS 12B in appendix B to this part. Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a variety of policies, specifications, standards, and corrective measures, this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow each source owner or operator to develop a QC system that is most effective and efficient for the circumstances.<PRTPAGE P="810"/>

            <P>These written procedures must be kept on record and available for inspection by the responsible enforcement agency. Also, as noted in section 5.2.4, below, whenever excessive inaccuracies of a Hg CEMS occur for two consecutive quarters, the source owner or operator must revise the current written procedures or modify or replace the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system to correct the deficiency causing the excessive inaccuracies.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Calibration Drift (CD) Assessment</HD>

            <P>4.1 CD Requirement. As described in 40 CFR 60.13(d) and 63.8(c), source owners and operators of Hg CEMS must check, record, and quantify the CD at two concentration values at least once daily (approximately 24 <PRTPAGE P="811"/>hours) in accordance with the method prescribed by the manufacturer. The Hg CEMS calibration must, as minimum, be adjusted whenever the daily zero (or low-level) CD or the daily high-level CD exceeds two times the limits of the applicable PS in appendix B of this part.</P>
            <P>4.2 Recording Requirement for Automatic CD Adjusting CEMS. CEMS that automatically adjust the data to the corrected calibration values (e.g., microprocessor control) must either be programmed to record the unadjusted concentration measured in the CD prior to resetting the calibration, if performed, or to record the amount of adjustment.</P>
            <P>4.3 Criteria for Excessive CD. If either the zero (or low-level) or high-level CD result exceeds twice the applicable drift specification in section 13.2 of PS 12A in appendix B to this part for five, consecutive, daily periods, the CEMS is out-of-control. If either the zero (or low-level) or high-level CD result exceeds four times the applicable drift specification in PS 12A during any CD check, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action. Following corrective action, repeat the CD checks.</P>

            <P>4.3.1 Out-Of-Control Period Definition. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the fifth, consecutive, daily CD check with a CD in excess of two times the allowable limit, or the time corresponding to the completion of the daily CD check preceding the daily CD check that results in a CD in excess of four times the allowable limit. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the CD check following corrective action that results in the CD's at both the zero (or low-level) and high-level measurement points being within the corresponding allowable CD limit (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> either two times or four times the allowable limit in the applicable PS in appendix B).</P>
            <P>4.3.2 CEMS Data Status During Out-of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used either to determine compliance with an emission limit or to meet a minimum data availability requirement specified in an applicable regulation or permit.</P>

            <P>Sequentially inject each of the three audit gases (zero and two upscale), three times each for a total of nine injections. Inject the gases in such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession.</P>

            <P>Use elemental Hg and oxidized Hg (mercuric chloride, HgCl<E T="52">2</E>) audit gases that are National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-certified or NIST-traceable following an EPA Traceability Protocol. If audit gas cylinders are used, do not dilute gas when challenging the Hg CEMS. For each reference gas concentration, determine the average of the three CEMS responses and subtract the average response from the reference gas value. Calculate the measurement error at each gas level using Equation 12A-1 in section 8.2 of PS 12A.</P>
            <P>5.1.3 Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA). As an alternative to the QGA, a RAA may be conducted in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession. To conduct a RAA, follow the RATA test procedures in section 8.5 of PS 12A in appendix B to this part, except that only three test runs are required.</P>
            <P>5.1.4 Alternative Quarterly Audits. Alternative quarterly audit procedures may be used as approved by the Administrator for three of four calendar quarters. One RATA is required at least every four calendar quarters, except in the case where the affected facility is off-line (does not operate) in the fourth calendar quarter since the quarter of the previous RATA. In that case, the RATA must be performed in the quarter in which the unit recommences operation. Also, quarterly gas audits (or RAAs, if applicable) are not required for calendar quarters in which the affected facility does not operate.</P>

            <P>5.2 Sorbent Trap Monitoring System Audit Requirements. For each sorbent trap monitoring system, a RATA must be conducted at least once every four calendar quarters, except as otherwise noted in section 5.1.4 of this appendix. Perform the RATA as described in section 8.3 of PS 12B in appendix B <PRTPAGE P="812"/>to this part. Calculate the results according to section 12.4 of PS 12A.</P>
            <P>5.3 Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the results of a RATA, QGA, or RAA exceed the applicable criteria in section 5.3.3, the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is out-of-control. If the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, the source owner or operator must audit the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system using the same type of test that failed to meet the accuracy criterion. For instance, a RATA must always be performed following an out-of-control period resulting from a failed RATA. Whenever audit results show the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system to be out-of-control, the owner or operator must report both the results of the failed test and the results of the retest following corrective action showing the CEMS to be operating within specifications.</P>
            <P>5.3.1 Out-Of-Control Period Definition. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour immediately following the completion of a RATA, RAA, QGA or system integrity check that fails to meet the applicable performance criteria in section 5.3.3, below. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of a subsequent successful test of the same type.</P>
            <P>5.3.2 Monitoring Data Status During Out-Of-Control Period. During the period the monitor is out-of-control, the monitoring data may not be used to determine compliance with an applicable emission limit or to meet a minimum data availability requirement in an applicable regulation or permit.</P>
            <P>5.3.3 Criteria for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. Unless specified otherwise in an applicable regulation or permit, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are:</P>
            <P>(a) For the RATA, the allowable RA in the applicable PS in appendix B (e.g., PS 12A or PS 12B).</P>
            <P>(b) For the QGA, ±15 percent of the average audit value or ±0.5 µg/m<SU>3</SU>, whichever is greater.</P>
            <P>(c) For the RAA, ±20 percent of the three run average or ±10 percent of the applicable standard, whichever is greater.</P>

            <P>5.3.4 Criteria for Acceptable QC Procedures. Repeated excessive inaccuracies (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> out-of-control conditions resulting from the quarterly audits) indicates the QC procedures are inadequate or that the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is incapable of providing quality data. Therefore, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, the source owner or operator must revise the QC procedures (<E T="03">see</E> section 3) or modify, repair, or replace the CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Reporting Requirements</HD>
            <P>6.1 Data Assessment Report. At the reporting interval specified in the applicable regulation or permit, report for each Hg CEMS and/or sorbent trap monitoring system the accuracy assessment results from section 5, above. For Hg CEMS, also report the CD assessment results from section 4, above. Report this information as a Data Assessment Report (DAR), and include the appropriate DAR(s) with the emissions report required under the applicable regulation or permit.</P>
            <P>6.2 Contents of the DAR. At a minimum, the DAR must contain the following information:</P>
            <P>6.2.1 Facility name and address including identification of source owner/operator.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Procedure 6. Quality Assurance Requirements for Gaseous Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination at Stationary Sources</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.0 Applicability and Principle</HD>
            <P>1.1 Applicability. Procedure 6 is used to evaluate the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures and evaluate the quality of data produced by any hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas, CAS: 7647-01-0, continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) that is used for determining compliance with emission standards for HCl on a continuous basis as specified in an applicable permit or regulation.</P>
            <P>1.1.1 This procedure specifies the minimum QA requirements necessary for the control and assessment of the quality of CEMS data submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a delegated authority. If you are responsible for one or more CEMS used for HCl compliance monitoring you must meet these minimum requirements and you are encouraged to develop and implement a more extensive QA program or to continue such programs where they already exist.</P>
            <P>1.1.2 Data collected as a result of QA and QC measures required in this procedure are to be submitted to the EPA or the delegated authority in accordance with the applicable regulation or permit. These data are to be used by both the delegated authority and you, as the CEMS operator, in assessing the effectiveness of the CEMS QC and QA procedures in the maintenance of acceptable CEMS operation and valid emission data.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.2 Principle</HD>
            <P>1.2.1 The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the quality of the CEMS data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS data by implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions form an iterative control loop. When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is inadequate, the control effort must be increased until the data quality is acceptable. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of data quality, this procedure specifies the assessment procedures to evaluate response drift and accuracy. The procedures specified are based on Performance Specification 18 (PS-18) in appendix B to this part.</P>
            <P>(<E T="04">Note:</E> Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a variety of policies, specifications, standards and corrective measures, this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow you, as source owner or operator to develop the most effective and efficient QC system for your circumstances.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.0 Definitions</HD>
            <P>See PS-18 of this subpart for the primary definitions used in this Procedure.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.0 QC Requirements</HD>
            <P>3.1 You, as a source owner or operator, must develop and implement a QC program. At a minimum, each QC program must include written procedures and/or manufacturer's information which should describe in detail, complete, step-by-step procedures and operations for each of the following activities:</P>
            <P>(a) Calibration Drift (CD) checks of CEMS;</P>
            <P>(b) CD determination and adjustment of CEMS;</P>
            <P>(c) Integrated Path (IP) CEMS temperature and pressure sensor accuracy checks;</P>
            <P>(d) IP CEMS beam intensity checks;</P>
            <P>(e) Routine and preventative maintenance of CEMS (including spare parts inventory);</P>
            <P>(f) Data recording, calculations, and reporting;</P>
            <P>(g) Accuracy audit procedures for CEMS including reference method(s); and</P>
            <P>(h) Program of corrective action for malfunctioning CEMS.</P>
            <P>3.2 These written procedures must be kept on site and available for inspection by the delegated authority. As described in section 5.4, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, you must revise the current written procedures, or modify or replace the CEMS to correct the deficiency causing the excessive inaccuracies.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.0 Daily Data Quality Requirements and Measurement Standardization Procedures</HD>
            <P>4.1 CD Assessment. An upscale gas, used to meet a requirement in this section must be either a NIST-traceable reference gas or a gas certified by the gas vendor to ±5.0 percent accuracy.</P>

            <P>4.1.1 CD Requirement. Consistent with 40 CFR 60.13(d) and 63.8(c), you, as source owners or operators of CEMS must check, record, and quantify the CD at two levels, using a zero gas and mid-level gas at least once daily (approximately every 24 hours). Perform the CD check in accordance with the procedure in applicable performance specification (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> section 11.8 of PS-18 in appendix B of this part). The daily zero- and mid-level CD must not exceed two times the drift limits specified in the applicable performance specification (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> section 13.2 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part.)</P>

            <P>4.1.2 Recording Requirement for CD Corrective action. Corrective actions taken to bring a CEMS back in control after exceeding a CD limit must be recorded and reported with the associated CEMS data. Reporting corrective action must include the <PRTPAGE P="814"/>unadjusted concentration measured prior to resetting the calibration and the adjusted value after resetting the calibration to bring the CEMS back into control.</P>
            <P>4.1.3 Dynamic Spiking Option for Mid-level CD. For extractive CEMS, you have the option to conduct a daily dynamic spiking procedure found in section 11.8.8 of PS-18 of appendix B of this part in lieu of the daily mid-level CD check. If this option is selected, the daily zero CD check is still required.</P>
            <P>4.1.4 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive CD. As specified in § 63.8(c)(7)(i)(A), a CEMS is out of control if the zero or mid-level CD exceeds two times the applicable CD specification in the applicable PS or in the relevant standard. When a CEMS is out of control, you as owner or operator of the affected source must take the necessary corrective actions and repeat the tests that caused the system to go out of control (in this case, the failed CD check) until the applicable performance requirements are met.</P>
            <P>4.1.5 Additional Quality Assurance for Data above Span. This procedure must be used when required by an applicable regulation and may be used when significant data above span are being collected. Furthermore, the terms of this procedure do not apply to the extent that alternate terms are otherwise specified in an applicable rule or permit.</P>
            <P>4.1.5.1 Any time the average measured concentration of HCl exceeds 150 percent of the span value for two consecutive one-hour averages, conduct the following 'above span' CEMS response check.</P>
            <P>4.1.5.1.1 Within a period of 24 hours (before or after) of the 'above span' period, introduce a higher, 'above span' HCl reference gas standard to the CEMS. Use 'above span' reference gas that meets the requirements of section 7.0 of PS-18 and target a concentration level between 75 and 125 percent of the highest hourly concentration measured during the period of measurements above span.</P>
            <P>4.1.5.1.2 Introduce the reference gas at the probe for extractive CEMS or for IP-CEMS as an equivalent path length corrected concentration in the instrument calibration cell.</P>
            <P>4.1.5.1.3 At no time may the 'above span' concentration exceed the analyzer full-scale range.</P>
            <P>4.1.5.2 Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The 'above span' response check is successful if the value measured by the CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas.</P>
            <P>4.1.5.3 If the 'above span' response check is conducted during the period when measured emissions are above span and there is a failure to collect at least one data point in an hour due to the response check duration, then determine the emissions average for that missed hour as the average of hourly averages for the hour preceding the missed hour and the hour following the missed hour.</P>

            <P>4.1.5.4 In the event that the 'above span' response check is not successful (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the CEMS measured value is not within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas), then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the 'above span' response check for reporting based on the CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in Eq. 6-1:</P>

            </GPH>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4.2 Beam Intensity Requirement for HCl IP-CEMS.</HD>
            <P>4.2.1 Beam Intensity Measurement. If you use a HCl IP-CEMS, you must quantify and record the beam intensity of the IP-CEMS in appropriate units at least once daily (approximately 24 hours apart) according to manufacturer's specifications and procedures.</P>
            <P>4.2.2 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive Beam Intensity Loss. If the beam intensity falls below the level established for the operation range determined following the procedures in section 11.2 of PS-18 of this part, then your CEMS is out-of-control. This quality check is independent of whether the CEMS daily CD is acceptable. If your CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action. You have the option to repeat the beam intensity test procedures in section 11.2 of PS-18 to expand the acceptable range of acceptable beam intensity. Following corrective action, repeat the beam intensity check.</P>

            <P>4.3 Out Of Control Period Duration for Daily Assessments. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the hour in which the owner or operator conducts a daily performance check (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> calibration drift or beam intensity check) that indicates an exceedance of the performance requirements established under this procedure. The end of the out-of-<PRTPAGE P="815"/>control period is the completion of daily assessment of the same type following corrective actions, which shows that the applicable performance requirements have been met.</P>
            <P>4.4 CEMS Data Status During Out-of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating compliance with an emissions limit nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availability as required and described in the applicable regulation or permit.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.0 Data Accuracy Assessment</HD>
            <P>You must audit your CEMS for the accuracy of HCl measurement on a regular basis at the frequency described in this section, unless otherwise specified in an applicable regulation or permit. Quarterly audits are performed at least once each calendar quarter. Successive quarterly audits, to the extent practicable, shall occur no closer than 2 months apart. Annual audits are performed at least once every four consecutive calendar quarters.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5.1 Temperature and Pressure Accuracy Assessment for IP CEMS.</HD>
            <P>5.1.1 Stack or source gas temperature measurement audits for HCl IP-CEMS must be conducted and recorded at least annually in accordance with the procedure described in section 11.3 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part. As an alternative, temperature measurement devices may be replaced with certified instruments on an annual basis. Units removed from service may be bench tested against an NIST traceable sensor and reused during subsequent years. Any measurement instrument or device that is used to conduct ongoing verification of temperature measurement must have an accuracy that is traceable to NIST.</P>
            <P>5.1.2 Stack or source gas pressure measurement audits for HCl IP-CEMS must be conducted and recorded at least annually in accordance with the procedure described in section 11.4 of PS-18 in appendix B of this part. As an alternative, pressure measurement devices may be replaced with certified instruments on an annual basis. Units removed from service may be bench tested against an NIST traceable sensor and reused during subsequent years. Any measurement instrument or device that is used to conduct ongoing verification of pressure measurement must have an accuracy that is traceable to NIST.</P>
            <P>5.1.3 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive Parameter Verification Inaccuracy. If the temperature or pressure verification audit exceeds the criteria in sections 5.3.4.5 and 5.3.4.6, respectively, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, you must repeat the failed verification audit until the temperature or pressure measurement device is operating within the applicable specifications, at which point the out-of-control period ends.</P>
            <P>5.2 Concentration Accuracy Auditing Requirements. Unless otherwise specified in an applicable rule or permit, you must audit the HCl measurement accuracy of each CEMS at least once each calendar quarter, except in the case where the affected facility is off-line (does not operate). In that case, the audit must be performed as soon as is practicable in the quarter in which the unit recommences operation. Successive quarterly audits must, to the extent practicable, be performed no less than 2 months apart. The accuracy audits shall be conducted as follows:</P>
            <P>5.2.1 Relative Accuracy Test Audit. A RATA must be conducted at least once every four calendar quarters, except as otherwise noted in sections 5.2.5 or 5.5 of this procedure. Perform the RATA as described in section 11.9 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part. If the HCl concentration measured by the RM during a RATA (in ppmv) is less than or equal to 20 percent of the concentration equivalent to the applicable emission standard, you must perform a Cylinder Gas Audit (CGA) or a Dynamic Spike Audit (DSA) for at least one subsequent (one of the following three) quarterly accuracy audits.</P>
            <P>5.2.2 Quarterly Relative Accuracy Audit (RAA). A quarterly RAA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession. To conduct an RAA, follow the test procedures in section 11.9 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part, except that only three test runs are required. The difference between the mean of the RM values and the mean of the CEMS responses relative to the mean of the RM values (or alternatively the emission standard) is used to assess the accuracy of the CEMS. Calculate the RAA results as described in section 6.2. As an alternative to an RAA, a cylinder gas audit or a dynamic spiking audit may be conducted.</P>
            <P>5.2.3 Cylinder Gas Audit. A quarterly CGA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three consecutive quarters. To perform a CGA, challenge the CEMS with a zero-level and two upscale level audit gases of known concentrations within the following ranges:</P>

            <P>5.2.3.1 Inject each of the three audit gases (zero and two upscale) three times each for a total of nine injections. Inject the gases in <PRTPAGE P="816"/>such a manner that the entire CEMS is challenged. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession.</P>
            <P>5.2.3.2 Use HCl audit gases that meet the requirements of section 7 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part.</P>
            <P>5.2.3.3 Calculate results as described in section 6.3.</P>
            <P>5.2.4 Dynamic Spiking Audit. For extractive CEMS, a quarterly DSA may be conducted as an option to conducting a RATA in three of four calendar quarters, but in no more than three quarters in succession.</P>
            <P>5.2.4.1 To conduct a DSA, you must challenge the entire HCl CEMS with a zero gas in accordance with the procedure in section 11.8 of PS-18 in appendix B of this part. You must also conduct the DS procedure as described in appendix A to PS-18 of appendix B to this part. You must conduct three spike injections with each of two upscale level audit gases. The upscale level gases must meet the requirements of section 7 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part and must be chosen to yield concentrations at the analyzer of 50 to 60 percent of span and 80 to 100 percent of span. Do not inject the same gas concentration twice in succession.</P>
            <P>5.2.4.2 Calculate results as described in section 6.4. To determine CEMS accuracy, you must calculate the dynamic spiking error (DSE) for each of the two upscale audit gases using Equation A5 in appendix A to PS-18 and Equation 6-3 in section 6.4 of Procedure 6 in appendix B to this part.</P>
            <P>5.2.5 Other Alternative Quarterly Audits. Other alternative audit procedures, as approved by the Administrator, may be used for three of four calendar quarters.</P>

            <P>5.3 Out of Control Criteria for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the results of the RATA, RAA, CGA, or DSA do not meet the applicable performance criteria in section 5.3.4, the CEMS is out-of-control. If the CEMS is out-of-control, take necessary corrective action to eliminate the problem. Following corrective action, the CEMS must pass a test of the same type that resulted in the out-of-control period to determine if the CEMS is operating within the specifications (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a RATA must always follow an out-of-control period resulting from a RATA).</P>
            <P>5.3.1 If the audit results show the CEMS to be out-of-control, you must report both the results of the audit showing the CEMS to be out-of-control and the results of the audit following corrective action showing the CEMS to be operating within specifications.</P>
            <P>5.3.2 Out-Of-Control Period Duration for Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. The beginning of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling for the failed RATA, RAA, CGA or DSA. The end of the out-of-control period is the time corresponding to the completion of the sampling of the subsequent successful audit.</P>
            <P>5.3.3 CEMS Data Status During Out-Of-Control Period. During the period the CEMS is out-of-control, the CEMS data may not be used in calculating emission compliance nor be counted towards meeting minimum data availability as required and described in the applicable regulation or permit.</P>
            <P>5.3.4 Criteria for Excessive Quarterly and Yearly Audit Inaccuracy. Unless specified otherwise in the applicable regulation or permit, the criteria for excessive inaccuracy are:</P>
            <P>5.3.4.1 For the RATA, the CEMS must meet the RA specifications in section 13.4 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part.</P>
            <P>5.3.4.2 For the CGA, the accuracy must not exceed 5.0 percent of the span value at the zero gas and the mid- and high-level reference gas concentrations.</P>

            <P>5.3.4.3 For the RAA, the RA must not exceed 20.0 percent of the RM<E T="52">avg</E> as calculated using Equation 6-2 in section 6.2 of this procedure whether calculated in units of HCl concentration or in units of the emission standard. In cases where the RA is calculated on a concentration (ppmv) basis, if the average HCl concentration measured by the RM during the test is less than 75 percent of the HCl concentration equivalent to the applicable standard, you may substitute the equivalent emission standard value (in ppmvw) in the denominator of Equation 6-2 in the place of RM<E T="52">avg</E> and the result of this alternative calculation of RA must not exceed 15.0 percent.</P>
            <P>5.3.4.4 For DSA, the accuracy must not exceed 5.0 percent of the span value at the zero gas and the mid- and high-level reference gas concentrations or 20.0 percent of the applicable emission standard, whichever is greater.</P>
            <P>5.3.4.5 For the gas temperature measurement audit, the CEMS must satisfy the requirements in section 13.7 in PS-18 of appendix B to this part.</P>
            <P>5.3.4.6 For the gas pressure measurement audit, the CEMS must satisfy the requirements in section 13.8 in PS-18 of appendix B to this part.</P>

            <P>5.4 Criteria for Acceptable QC Procedures. Repeated excessive inaccuracies (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> out-of-control conditions resulting from the quarterly or yearly audits) indicate that the QC procedures are inadequate or that the CEMS is incapable of providing quality data. Therefore, whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive quarters, you must revise the QC procedures (see section 3.0) or modify or replace the CEMS.</P>
            <P>5.5 Criteria for Optional QA Test Frequency. If all the quality criteria are met in sections 4 and 5 of this procedure, the CEMS is in-control.</P>

            <P>5.5.1 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable rule or permit, if the CEMS is in-control and if your source emits ≤75 percent of the HCl emission limit for each averaging <PRTPAGE P="817"/>period as specified in the relevant standard for eight consecutive quarters that include a minimum of two RATAs, you may revise your auditing procedures to use CGA, RAA or DSA each quarter for seven subsequent quarters following a RATA.</P>
            <P>5.5.2 You must perform at least one RATA that meets the acceptance criteria every 2 years.</P>
            <P>5.5.3 If you fail a RATA, RAA, CGA, or DSA, then the audit schedule in section 5.2 must be followed until the audit results meet the criteria in section 5.3.4 to start requalifying for the optional QA test frequency in section 5.5.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.0 Calculations for CEMS Data Accuracy</HD>
            <P>6.1 RATA RA Calculation. Follow Equations 9 through 14 in section 12 of PS-18 in appendix B to this part to calculate the RA for the RATA. The RATA must be calculated either in units of the applicable emission standard or in concentration units (ppmv).</P>
            <P>6.2 RAA Accuracy Calculation. Use Equation 6-2 to calculate the accuracy for the RAA. The RA may be calculated in concentration units (ppmv) or in the units of the applicable emission standard.</P>

            <P>3.1 If the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to comply with the 470 ng/J (1.1 lbs/MMBTU) of combined heat input emission limit under § 60.43(e), he shall notify the Regional Administrator, of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Region 5 and the Director, of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) at least 30 days in advance of the date such election is to take effect, stating the date such operation is to commence. When the owner or operator elects to comply with this limit after one or more periods of reverting to the 520 ng/J heat input (1.2 lbs/MMBTU) limit of § 60.43(a)(2), as provided under 3.4, he shall notify the Regional Administrator of the USEPA, Region 5 and the Director of the (IEPA) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance of the date such election is to take effect.</P>
            <P>3.2 Compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limit under § 60.43(e) is determined on a continuous basis by performance testing using CEMs. Within 60 days after the initial operation of Units 1 and 2 subject to the combined emission limit in § 60.43(e), the owner or operator shall conduct an initial performance test, as required by § 60.8, to determine compliance with the combined emission limit. This initial performance test is to be scheduled so that the thirtieth boiler operating day of the 30 successive boiler operating days is completed within 60 days after initial operation subject to the 470 ng/J (1.1 lbs/MMBTU) combined emission limit. Following the initial performance test, a separate performance test is completed at the end of each boiler operating day Unit 1 and Unit 2 are subject to § 60.43(e), and a new 30 day average emission rate calculated.</P>

            <P>3.2.1 Following the initial performance test, a new 30 day average emission rate is calculated for each boiler operating day the affected facility is subject to § 60.43(e). If the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to comply with § 60.43(e) after one or more periods of reverting to the 520 ng/J heat input (1.2 lbs/MMBTU) limit under § 60.43(a)(2), as provided under 3.4, the 30 day <PRTPAGE P="819"/>average emission rate under § 60.43(e) is calculated using emissions data of the current boiler operating day and data for the previous 29 boiler operating days when the affected facility was subject to § 60.43(e). Periods of operation of the affected facility under § 60.43(a)(2) are not considered boiler operating days. Emissions data collected during operation under § 60.43(a)(2) are not considered relative to 4.6 and emissions data are not included in calculations of emission under § 60.43(e).</P>

            <P>“It is important to periodically monitor the operation of the catalytic combustor to ensure that it is functioning properly and to determine when it needs to be replaced. A non-functioning combustor will result in a loss of heating efficiency, and an increase in creosote and emissions. Following is a list of items that should be checked on a periodic basis:</P>

            <P>• Combustors should be visually inspected at least three times during the heating season to determine if physical degradation has occurred. Actual removal of the combustor is not recommended unless more detailed inspection is warranted because of decreased performance. If any of these conditions exists, refer to Catalyst Troubleshooting section of this owner's manual.<PRTPAGE P="825"/>
            </P>
            <P>• This catalytic (<E T="03">or hybrid</E>) heater is equipped with a temperature probe to monitor catalyst operation. Properly functioning combustors typically maintain temperatures in excess of <E T="03">500</E> °F, and often reach temperatures in excess of <E T="03">1,000</E> °F. If catalyst temperatures are not in excess of <E T="03">500</E> °F, refer to Catalyst Troubleshooting section of this owner's manual.</P>
            <P>• You can get an indication of whether the catalyst is working by comparing the amount of smoke leaving the chimney when the smoke is going through the combustor and catalyst light-off has been achieved, to the amount of smoke leaving the chimney when the smoke is not routed through the combustor (bypass mode).</P>
