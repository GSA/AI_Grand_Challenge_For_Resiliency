      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              What This Subpart Covers
              
                § 63.6580
                What is the purpose of subpart ZZZZ?
                Subpart ZZZZ establishes national emission limitations and operating limitations for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) located at major and area sources of HAP emissions. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations and operating limitations.
                [73 FR 3603, Jan. 18, 2008]
              
              
                § 63.6585
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a stationary RICE at a major or area source of HAP emissions, except if the stationary RICE is being tested at a stationary RICE test cell/stand.
                (a) A stationary RICE is any internal combustion engine which uses reciprocating motion to convert heat energy into mechanical work and which is not mobile. Stationary RICE differ from mobile RICE in that a stationary RICE is not a non-road engine as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30, and is not used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition.

                (b) A major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year, except that for oil and gas production facilities, a major source of HAP emissions is determined for each surface site.
                (c) An area source of HAP emissions is a source that is not a major source.
                (d) If you are an owner or operator of an area source subject to this subpart, your status as an entity subject to a standard or other requirements under this subpart does not subject you to the obligation to obtain a permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, provided you are not required to obtain a permit under 40 CFR 70.3(a) or 40 CFR 71.3(a) for a reason other than your status as an area source under this subpart. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, you must continue to comply with the provisions of this subpart as applicable.
                (e) If you are an owner or operator of a stationary RICE used for national security purposes, you may be eligible to request an exemption from the requirements of this subpart as described in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart C.
                (f) The emergency stationary RICE listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section are not subject to this subpart. The stationary RICE must meet the definition of an emergency stationary RICE in § 63.6675, which includes operating according to the provisions specified in § 63.6640(f).
                (1) Existing residential emergency stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions that do not operate or are not contractually obligated to be available for more than 15 hours per calendar year for the purposes specified in § 63.6640(f)(2)(ii) and (iii) and that do not operate for the purpose specified in § 63.6640(f)(4)(ii).
                (2) Existing commercial emergency stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions that do not operate or are not contractually obligated to be available for more than 15 hours per calendar year for the purposes specified in § 63.6640(f)(2)(ii) and (iii) and that do not operate for the purpose specified in § 63.6640(f)(4)(ii).
                (3) Existing institutional emergency stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions that do not operate or are not contractually obligated to be available for more than 15 hours per calendar year for the purposes specified in § 63.6640(f)(2)(ii) and (iii) and that do not operate for the purpose specified in § 63.6640(f)(4)(ii).

                  Where:
                  
                  Cadj = Calculated concentration of CO, THC, or formaldehyde adjusted to 15 percent O2.
                  Cd = Measured concentration of CO, THC, or formaldehyde, uncorrected.

                (h) If you petition the Administrator for approval of no operating limitations, your petition must include the information described in paragraphs (h)(1) through (7) of this section.

                (1) Identification of the parameters associated with operation of the stationary RICE and any emission control device which could change intentionally (e.g., operator adjustment, automatic controller adjustment, etc.) or unintentionally (e.g., wear and tear, error, etc.) on a routine basis or over time;

If all of these condemning limits are not exceeded, the engine owner or operator is not required to change the oil. If any of the limits are exceeded, the engine owner or operator must change the oil within 2 business days of receiving the results of the analysis; if the engine is not in operation when the results of the analysis are received, the engine owner or operator must change the oil within 2 business days or before commencing operation, whichever is later. The owner or operator must keep records of the parameters that are analyzed as part of the program, the results of the analysis, and the oil changes for the engine. The analysis program must be part of the maintenance plan for the engine.

                § 63.6630
                How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations, operating limitations, and other requirements?
                (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emission limitation, operating limitation, and other requirement that applies to you according to Table 5 of this subpart.
                (b) During the initial performance test, you must establish each operating limitation in Tables 1b and 2b of this subpart that applies to you.
                (c) You must submit the Notification of Compliance Status containing the results of the initial compliance demonstration according to the requirements in § 63.6645.
                (d) Non-emergency 4SRB stationary RICE complying with the requirement to reduce formaldehyde emissions by 76 percent or more can demonstrate initial compliance with the formaldehyde emission limit by testing for THC instead of formaldehyde. The testing must be conducted according to the requirements in Table 4 of this subpart. The average reduction of emissions of THC determined from the performance test must be equal to or greater than 30 percent.
                (e) The initial compliance demonstration required for existing non-emergency 4SLB and 4SRB stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 HP located at an area source of HAP that are not remote stationary RICE and that are operated more than 24 hours per calendar year must be conducted according to the following requirements:
                (1) The compliance demonstration must consist of at least three test runs.
                (2) Each test run must be of at least 15 minute duration, except that each test conducted using the method in appendix A to this subpart must consist of at least one measurement cycle and include at least 2 minutes of test data phase measurement.
                (3) If you are demonstrating compliance with the CO concentration or CO percent reduction requirement, you must measure CO emissions using one of the CO measurement methods specified in Table 4 of this subpart, or using appendix A to this subpart.
                (4) If you are demonstrating compliance with the THC percent reduction requirement, you must measure THC emissions using Method 25A, reported as propane, of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
                (5) You must measure O2 using one of the O2 measurement methods specified in Table 4 of this subpart. Measurements to determine O2 concentration must be made at the same time as the measurements for CO or THC concentration.

                § 63.6635
                How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
                (a) If you must comply with emission and operating limitations, you must monitor and collect data according to this section.
                (b) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, required performance evaluations, and required quality assurance or control activities, you must monitor continuously at all times that the stationary RICE is operating. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
                (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels. You must, however, use all the valid data collected during all other periods.

These instances are deviations from the emission and operating limitations in this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.6650. If you change your catalyst, you must reestablish the values of the operating parameters measured during the initial performance test. When you reestablish the values of your operating parameters, you must also conduct a performance test to demonstrate that you are meeting the required emission limitation applicable to your stationary RICE.
                (c) The annual compliance demonstration required for existing non-emergency 4SLB and 4SRB stationary RICE with a site rating of more than 500 HP located at an area source of HAP that are not remote stationary RICE and that are operated more than 24 hours per calendar year must be conducted according to the following requirements:
                (1) The compliance demonstration must consist of at least one test run.
                (2) Each test run must be of at least 15 minute duration, except that each test conducted using the method in appendix A to this subpart must consist of at least one measurement cycle and include at least 2 minutes of test data phase measurement.
                (3) If you are demonstrating compliance with the CO concentration or CO percent reduction requirement, you must measure CO emissions using one of the CO measurement methods specified in Table 4 of this subpart, or using appendix A to this subpart.

                (5) You must measure O2 using one of the O2 measurement methods specified in Table 4 of this subpart. Measurements to determine O2 concentration must be made at the same time as the measurements for CO or THC concentration.

                (6) If you are demonstrating compliance with the CO or THC percent reduction requirement, you must measure CO or THC emissions and O2 emissions simultaneously at the inlet and outlet of the control device.

                (7) If the results of the annual compliance demonstration show that the emissions exceed the levels specified in Table 6 of this subpart, the stationary RICE must be shut down as soon as safely possible, and appropriate corrective action must be taken (e.g., repairs, catalyst cleaning, catalyst replacement). The stationary RICE must be retested within 7 days of being restarted and the emissions must meet the levels specified in Table 6 of this subpart. If the retest shows that the emissions continue to exceed the specified levels, the stationary RICE must again be shut down as soon as safely possible, and the stationary RICE may not operate, except for purposes of startup and testing, until the owner/operator demonstrates through testing that the emissions do not exceed the levels specified in Table 6 of this subpart.
                (d) For new, reconstructed, and rebuilt stationary RICE, deviations from the emission or operating limitations that occur during the first 200 hours of operation from engine startup (engine burn-in period) are not violations. Rebuilt stationary RICE means a stationary RICE that has been rebuilt as that term is defined in 40 CFR 94.11(a).
                (e) You must also report each instance in which you did not meet the requirements in Table 8 to this subpart that apply to you. If you own or operate a new or reconstructed stationary RICE with a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions (except new or reconstructed 4SLB engines greater than or equal to 250 and less than or equal to 500 brake HP), a new or reconstructed stationary RICE located at an area source of HAP emissions, or any of the following RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you do not need to comply with the requirements in Table 8 to this subpart: An existing 2SLB stationary RICE, an existing 4SLB stationary RICE, an existing emergency stationary RICE, an existing limited use stationary RICE, or an existing stationary RICE which fires landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis. If you own or operate any of the following RICE with a site rating of more than 500 brake HP located at a major source of HAP emissions, you do not need to comply with the requirements in Table 8 to this subpart, except for the initial notification requirements: a new or reconstructed stationary RICE that combusts landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis, a new or reconstructed emergency stationary RICE, or a new or reconstructed limited use stationary RICE.
                (f) If you own or operate an emergency stationary RICE, you must operate the emergency stationary RICE according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section. In order for the engine to be considered an emergency stationary RICE under this subpart, any operation other than emergency operation, maintenance and testing, emergency demand response, and operation in non-emergency situations for 50 hours per year, as described in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, is prohibited. If you do not operate the engine according to the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, the engine will not be considered an emergency engine under this subpart and must meet all requirements for non-emergency engines.
                (1) There is no time limit on the use of emergency stationary RICE in emergency situations.
                (2) You may operate your emergency stationary RICE for any combination of the purposes specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section for a maximum of 100 hours per calendar year. Any operation for non-emergency situations as allowed by paragraphs (f)(3) and (4) of this section counts as part of the 100 hours per calendar year allowed by this paragraph (f)(2).

                (i) Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for maintenance checks and readiness testing, provided that the tests are recommended by federal, state or local government, the manufacturer, the vendor, the regional transmission organization or equivalent balancing authority and transmission operator, or the insurance company associated with the engine. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for approval of additional hours to be used for maintenance checks and readiness testing, but a petition is not required if the owner or operator maintains records indicating that federal, state, or local standards require maintenance and testing of emergency RICE beyond 100 hours per calendar year.
                (ii) Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for emergency demand response for periods in which the Reliability Coordinator under the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standard EOP-002-3, Capacity and Energy Emergencies (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), or other authorized entity as determined by the Reliability Coordinator, has declared an Energy Emergency Alert Level 2 as defined in the NERC Reliability Standard EOP-002-3.
                (iii) Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for periods where there is a deviation of voltage or frequency of 5 percent or greater below standard voltage or frequency.
                (3) Emergency stationary RICE located at major sources of HAP may be operated for up to 50 hours per calendar year in non-emergency situations. The 50 hours of operation in non-emergency situations are counted as part of the 100 hours per calendar year for maintenance and testing and emergency demand response provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations cannot be used for peak shaving or non-emergency demand response, or to generate income for a facility to supply power to an electric grid or otherwise supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity.
                (4) Emergency stationary RICE located at area sources of HAP may be operated for up to 50 hours per calendar year in non-emergency situations. The 50 hours of operation in non-emergency situations are counted as part of the 100 hours per calendar year for maintenance and testing and emergency demand response provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, the 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations cannot be used for peak shaving or non-emergency demand response, or to generate income for a facility to an electric grid or otherwise supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity.
                (i) Prior to May 3, 2014, the 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations can be used for peak shaving or non-emergency demand response to generate income for a facility, or to otherwise supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity if the engine is operated as part of a peak shaving (load management program) with the local distribution system operator and the power is provided only to the facility itself or to support the local distribution system.
                (ii) The 50 hours per year for non-emergency situations can be used to supply power as part of a financial arrangement with another entity if all of the following conditions are met:
                (A) The engine is dispatched by the local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator.
                (B) The dispatch is intended to mitigate local transmission and/or distribution limitations so as to avert potential voltage collapse or line overloads that could lead to the interruption of power supply in a local area or region.
                (C) The dispatch follows reliability, emergency operation or similar protocols that follow specific NERC, regional, state, public utility commission or local standards or guidelines.
                (D) The power is provided only to the facility itself or to support the local transmission and distribution system.
                (E) The owner or operator identifies and records the entity that dispatches the engine and the specific NERC, regional, state, public utility commission or local standards or guidelines that are being followed for dispatching the engine. The local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator may keep these records on behalf of the engine owner or operator.

              Appendix A to Subpart ZZZZ of Part 63—Protocol for Using an Electrochemical Analyzer to Determine Oxygen and Carbon Monoxide Concentrations From Certain Engines
              1.0 Scope and Application. What is this Protocol?

              This protocol is a procedure for using portable electrochemical (EC) cells for measuring carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2) concentrations in controlled and uncontrolled emissions from existing stationary 4-stroke lean burn and 4-stroke rich burn reciprocating internal combustion engines as specified in the applicable rule.
              1.1 Analytes. What does this protocol determine?

              This protocol measures the engine exhaust gas concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2).
              
                
                  Analyte
                  CAS No.
                  Sensitivity
                
                
                  Carbon monoxide (CO)
                  630-08-0
                  Minimum detectable limit should be 2 percent of the nominal range or 1 ppm, whichever is less restrictive.
                
                
                  Oxygen (O2)
                  
                    7782-44-7
                  
                
              
              1.2 Applicability. When is this protocol acceptable?
              This protocol is applicable to 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ. Because of inherent cross sensitivities of EC cells, you must not apply this protocol to other emissions sources without specific instruction to that effect.
              1.3 Data Quality Objectives. How good must my collected data be?
              Refer to Section 13 to verify and document acceptable analyzer performance.
              1.4 Range. What is the targeted analytical range for this protocol?

              The measurement system and EC cell design(s) conforming to this protocol will determine the analytical range for each gas component. The nominal ranges are defined by choosing up-scale calibration gas concentrations near the maximum anticipated flue gas concentrations for CO and O2, or no more than twice the permitted CO level.
              1.5 Sensitivity. What minimum detectable limit will this protocol yield for a particular gas component?
              The minimum detectable limit depends on the nominal range and resolution of the specific EC cell used, and the signal to noise ratio of the measurement system. The minimum detectable limit should be 2 percent of the nominal range or 1 ppm, whichever is less restrictive.
              2.0 Summary of Protocol

              In this protocol, a gas sample is extracted from an engine exhaust system and then conveyed to a portable EC analyzer for measurement of CO and O2 gas concentrations. This method provides measurement system performance specifications and sampling protocols to ensure reliable data. You may use additions to, or modifications of vendor supplied measurement systems (e.g., heated or unheated sample lines, thermocouples, flow meters, selective gas scrubbers, etc.) to meet the design specifications of this protocol. Do not make changes to the measurement system from the as-verified configuration (Section 3.12).
              3.0 Definitions
              
                3.1 Measurement System. The total equipment required for the measurement of CO and O2 concentrations. The measurement system consists of the following major subsystems:
              
                3.1.1 Data Recorder. A strip chart recorder, computer or digital recorder for logging measurement data from the analyzer output. You may record measurement data from the digital data display manually or electronically.
              
                3.1.2 Electrochemical (EC) Cell. A device, similar to a fuel cell, used to sense the presence of a specific analyte and generate an electrical current output proportional to the analyte concentration.
              
                3.1.3 Interference Gas Scrubber. A device used to remove or neutralize chemical compounds that may interfere with the selective operation of an EC cell.
              
                3.1.4 Moisture Removal System. Any device used to reduce the concentration of moisture in the sample stream so as to protect the EC cells from the damaging effects of condensation and to minimize errors in measurements caused by the scrubbing of soluble gases.
              
                3.1.5 Sample Interface. The portion of the system used for one or more of the following: sample acquisition; sample transport; sample conditioning or protection of the EC cell from any degrading effects of the engine exhaust effluent; removal of particulate matter and condensed moisture.
              
                3.2 Nominal Range. The range of analyte concentrations over which each EC cell is operated (normally 25 percent to 150 percent of up-scale calibration gas value). Several nominal ranges can be used for any given cell so long as the calibration and repeatability checks for that range remain within specifications.
              
                3.3 Calibration Gas. A vendor certified concentration of a specific analyte in an appropriate balance gas.
              
                3.4 Zero Calibration Error. The analyte concentration output exhibited by the EC cell in response to zero-level calibration gas.
              
                3.5 Up-Scale Calibration Error. The mean of the difference between the analyte concentration exhibited by the EC cell and the certified concentration of the up-scale calibration gas.
              
                3.6 Interference Check. A procedure for quantifying analytical interference from components in the engine exhaust gas other than the targeted analytes.
              
                3.7 Repeatability Check. A protocol for demonstrating that an EC cell operated over a given nominal analyte concentration range provides a stable and consistent response and is not significantly affected by repeated exposure to that gas.
              
                3.8 Sample Flow Rate. The flow rate of the gas sample as it passes through the EC cell. In some situations, EC cells can experience drift with changes in flow rate. The flow rate must be monitored and documented during all phases of a sampling run.
              
                3.9 Sampling Run. A timed three-phase event whereby an EC cell's response rises and plateaus in a sample conditioning phase, remains relatively constant during a measurement data phase, then declines during a refresh phase. The sample conditioning phase exposes the EC cell to the gas sample for a length of time sufficient to reach a constant response. The measurement data phase is the time interval during which gas sample measurements can be made that meet the acceptance criteria of this protocol. The refresh phase then purges the EC cells with CO-free air. The refresh phase replenishes requisite O2 and moisture in the electrolyte reserve and provides a mechanism to de-gas or desorb any interference gas scrubbers or filters so as to enable a stable CO EC cell response. There are four primary types of sampling runs: pre- sampling calibrations; stack gas sampling; post-sampling calibration checks; and measurement system repeatability checks. Stack gas sampling runs can be chained together for extended evaluations, providing all other procedural specifications are met.
              
                3.10 Sampling Day. A time not to exceed twelve hours from the time of the pre-sampling calibration to the post-sampling calibration check. During this time, stack gas sampling runs can be repeated without repeated recalibrations, providing all other sampling specifications have been met.
              
                3.11 Pre-Sampling Calibration/Post-Sampling Calibration Check. The protocols executed at the beginning and end of each sampling day to bracket measurement readings with controlled performance checks.
              
                3.12 Performance-Established Configuration. The EC cell and sampling system configuration that existed at the time that it initially met the performance requirements of this protocol.
              4.0 Interferences.
              When present in sufficient concentrations, NO and NO2 are two gas species that have been reported to interfere with CO concentration measurements. In the likelihood of this occurrence, it is the protocol user's responsibility to employ and properly maintain an appropriate CO EC cell filter or scrubber for removal of these gases, as described in Section 6.2.12.
              5.0 Safety. [Reserved]
              6.0 Equipment and Supplies.
              6.1 What equipment do I need for the measurement system?
              The system must maintain the gas sample at conditions that will prevent moisture condensation in the sample transport lines, both before and as the sample gas contacts the EC cells. The essential components of the measurement system are described below.
              6.2 Measurement System Components.
              
                6.2.1 Sample Probe. A single extraction-point probe constructed of glass, stainless steel or other non-reactive material, and of length sufficient to reach any designated sampling point. The sample probe must be designed to prevent plugging due to condensation or particulate matter.
              
                6.2.2 Sample Line. Non-reactive tubing to transport the effluent from the sample probe to the EC cell.
              
                6.2.3 Calibration Assembly (optional). A three-way valve assembly or equivalent to introduce calibration gases at ambient pressure at the exit end of the sample probe during calibration checks. The assembly must be designed such that only stack gas or calibration gas flows in the sample line and all gases flow through any gas path filters.
              
                6.2.4 Particulate Filter (optional). Filters before the inlet of the EC cell to prevent accumulation of particulate material in the measurement system and extend the useful life of the components. All filters must be fabricated of materials that are non-reactive to the gas mixtures being sampled.
              
                6.2.5 Sample Pump. A leak-free pump to provide undiluted sample gas to the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system. If located upstream of the EC cells, the pump must be constructed of a material that is non-reactive to the gas mixtures being sampled.
              
                6.2.8 Sample Flow Rate Monitoring. An adjustable rotameter or equivalent device used to adjust and maintain the sample flow rate through the analyzer as prescribed.
              
                6.2.9 Sample Gas Manifold (optional). A manifold to divert a portion of the sample gas stream to the analyzer and the remainder to a by-pass discharge vent. The sample gas manifold may also include provisions for introducing calibration gases directly to the analyzer. The manifold must be constructed of a material that is non-reactive to the gas mixtures being sampled.
              
                6.2.10 EC cell. A device containing one or more EC cells to determine the CO and O2 concentrations in the sample gas stream. The EC cell(s) must meet the applicable performance specifications of Section 13 of this protocol.
              
                6.2.11 Data Recorder. A strip chart recorder, computer or digital recorder to make a record of analyzer output data. The data recorder resolution (i.e., readability) must be no greater than 1 ppm for CO; 0.1 percent for O2; and one degree (either °C or °F) for temperature. Alternatively, you may use a digital or analog meter having the same resolution to observe and manually record the analyzer responses.
              
                6.2.12 Interference Gas Filter or Scrubber. A device to remove interfering compounds upstream of the CO EC cell. Specific interference gas filters or scrubbers used in the performance-established configuration of the analyzer must continue to be used. Such a filter or scrubber must have a means to determine when the removal agent is exhausted. Periodically replace or replenish it in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
              7.0 Reagents and Standards. What calibration gases are needed?
              
                7.1 Calibration Gases. CO calibration gases for the EC cell must be CO in nitrogen or CO in a mixture of nitrogen and O2. Use CO calibration gases with labeled concentration values certified by the manufacturer to be within ±5 percent of the label value. Dry ambient air (20.9 percent O2) is acceptable for calibration of the O2 cell. If needed, any lower percentage O2 calibration gas must be a mixture of O2 in nitrogen.
              
                7.1.1 Up-Scale CO Calibration Gas Concentration. Choose one or more up-scale gas concentrations such that the average of the stack gas measurements for each stack gas sampling run are between 25 and 150 percent of those concentrations. Alternatively, choose an up-scale gas that does not exceed twice the concentration of the applicable outlet standard. If a measured gas value exceeds 150 percent of the up-scale CO calibration gas value at any time during the stack gas sampling run, the run must be discarded and repeated.
              
                7.1.2 Up-Scale O
                2
                Calibration Gas Concentration.
              
              Select an O2 gas concentration such that the difference between the gas concentration and the average stack gas measurement or reading for each sample run is less than 15 percent O2. When the average exhaust gas O2 readings are above 6 percent, you may use dry ambient air (20.9 percent O2) for the up-scale O2 calibration gas.
              
                7.1.3 Zero Gas. Use an inert gas that contains less than 0.25 percent of the up-scale CO calibration gas concentration. You may use dry air that is free from ambient CO and other combustion gas products (e.g., CO2).
              8.0 Sample Collection and Analysis
              
                8.1 Selection of Sampling Sites.
              
              
                8.1.1 Control Device Inlet. Select a sampling site sufficiently downstream of the engine so that the combustion gases should be well mixed. Use a single sampling extraction point near the center of the duct (e.g., within the 10 percent centroidal area), unless instructed otherwise.
              
                8.1.2 Exhaust Gas Outlet. Select a sampling site located at least two stack diameters downstream of any disturbance (e.g., turbocharger exhaust, crossover junction or recirculation take-off) and at least one-half stack diameter upstream of the gas discharge to the atmosphere. Use a single sampling extraction point near the center of the duct (e.g., within the 10 percent centroidal area), unless instructed otherwise.
              
                8.2 Stack Gas Collection and Analysis. Prior to the first stack gas sampling run, conduct that the pre-sampling calibration in accordance with Section 10.1. Use Figure 1 to record all data. Zero the analyzer with zero gas. Confirm and record that the scrubber media color is correct and not exhausted. Then position the probe at the sampling point and begin the sampling run at the same flow rate used during the up-scale calibration. Record the start time. Record all EC cell output responses and the flow rate during the “sample conditioning phase” once per minute until constant readings are obtained. Then begin the “measurement data phase” and record readings every 15 seconds for at least two minutes (or eight readings), or as otherwise required to achieve two continuous minutes of data that meet the specification given in Section 13.1. Finally, perform the “refresh phase” by introducing dry air, free from CO and other combustion gases, until several minute-to-minute readings of consistent value have been obtained. For each run use the “measurement data phase” readings to calculate the average stack gas CO and O2 concentrations.
              
                8.3 EC Cell Rate. Maintain the EC cell sample flow rate so that it does not vary by more than ±10 percent throughout the pre-sampling calibration, stack gas sampling and post-sampling calibration check. Alternatively, the EC cell sample flow rate can be maintained within a tolerance range that does not affect the gas concentration readings by more than ±3 percent, as instructed by the EC cell manufacturer.
              9.0 Quality Control (Reserved)
              10.0 Calibration and Standardization
              
                10.1 Pre-Sampling Calibration. Conduct the following protocol once for each nominal range to be used on each EC cell before performing a stack gas sampling run on each field sampling day. Repeat the calibration if you replace an EC cell before completing all of the sampling runs. There is no prescribed order for calibration of the EC cells; however, each cell must complete the measurement data phase during calibration. Assemble the measurement system by following the manufacturer's recommended protocols including for preparing and preconditioning the EC cell. Assure the measurement system has no leaks and verify the gas scrubbing agent is not depleted. Use Figure 1 to record all data.
              
                10.1.1 Zero Calibration. For both the O2 and CO cells, introduce zero gas to the measurement system (e.g., at the calibration assembly) and record the concentration reading every minute until readings are constant for at least two consecutive minutes. Include the time and sample flow rate. Repeat the steps in this section at least once to verify the zero calibration for each component gas.
              
                10.1.2 Zero Calibration Tolerance. For each zero gas introduction, the zero level output must be less than or equal to ±3 percent of the up-scale gas value or ±1 ppm, whichever is less restrictive, for the CO channel and less than or equal to ±0.3 percent O2 for the O2 channel.
              
                10.1.3 Up-Scale Calibration. Individually introduce each calibration gas to the measurement system (e.g., at the calibration assembly) and record the start time. Record all EC cell output responses and the flow rate during this “sample conditioning phase” once per minute until readings are constant for at least two minutes. Then begin the “measurement data phase” and record readings every 15 seconds for a total of two minutes, or as otherwise required. Finally, perform the “refresh phase” by introducing dry air, free from CO and other combustion gases, until readings are constant for at least two consecutive minutes. Then repeat the steps in this section at least once to verify the calibration for each component gas. Introduce all gases to flow through the entire sample handling system (i.e., at the exit end of the sampling probe or the calibration assembly).
              
                10.1.4 Up-Scale Calibration Error. The mean of the difference of the “measurement data phase” readings from the reported standard gas value must be less than or equal to ±5 percent or ±1 ppm for CO or ±0.5 percent O2, whichever is less restrictive, respectively. The maximum allowable deviation from the mean measured value of any single “measurement data phase” reading must be less than or equal to ±2 percent or ±1 ppm for CO or ±0.5 percent O2, whichever is less restrictive, respectively.
              
                10.2 Post-Sampling Calibration Check. Conduct a stack gas post-sampling calibration check after the stack gas sampling run or set of runs and within 12 hours of the initial calibration. Conduct up-scale and zero calibration checks using the protocol in Section 10.1. Make no changes to the sampling system or EC cell calibration until all post-sampling calibration checks have been recorded. If either the zero or up-scale calibration error exceeds the respective specification in Sections 10.1.2 and 10.1.4 then all measurement data collected since the previous successful calibrations are invalid and re-calibration and re-sampling are required. If the sampling system is disassembled or the EC cell calibration is adjusted, repeat the calibration check before conducting the next analyzer sampling run.
              11.0 Analytical Procedure
              The analytical procedure is fully discussed in Section 8.
              12.0 Calculations and Data Analysis
              Determine the CO and O2 concentrations for each stack gas sampling run by calculating the mean gas concentrations of the data recorded during the “measurement data phase”.
              13.0 Protocol Performance
              Use the following protocols to verify consistent analyzer performance during each field sampling day.
              
                13.1 Measurement Data Phase Performance Check. Calculate the mean of the readings from the “measurement data phase”. The maximum allowable deviation from the mean for each of the individual readings is ±2 percent, or ±1 ppm, whichever is less restrictive. Record the mean value and maximum deviation for each gas monitored. Data must conform to Section 10.1.4. The EC cell flow rate must conform to the specification in Section 8.3.
              
              
                Example:

                A measurement data phase is invalid if the maximum deviation of any single reading comprising that mean is greater than ±2 percent or ±1 ppm (the default criteria). For example, if the mean = 30 ppm, single readings of below 29 ppm and above 31 ppm are disallowed).
              
              
              
                13.2 Interference Check. Before the initial use of the EC cell and interference gas scrubber in the field, and semi-annually thereafter, challenge the interference gas scrubber with NO and NO2 gas standards that are generally recognized as representative of diesel-fueled engine NO and NO2 emission values. Record the responses displayed by the CO EC cell and other pertinent data on Figure 1 or a similar form.
              
                13.2.1 Interference Response. The combined NO and NO2 interference response should be less than or equal to ±5 percent of the up-scale CO calibration gas concentration.
              
                13.3 Repeatability Check. Conduct the following check once for each nominal range that is to be used on the CO EC cell within 5 days prior to each field sampling program. If a field sampling program lasts longer than 5 days, repeat this check every 5 days. Immediately repeat the check if the EC cell is replaced or if the EC cell is exposed to gas concentrations greater than 150 percent of the highest up-scale gas concentration.
              
                13.3.1 Repeatability Check Procedure. Perform a complete EC cell sampling run (all three phases) by introducing the CO calibration gas to the measurement system and record the response. Follow Section 10.1.3. Use Figure 1 to record all data. Repeat the run three times for a total of four complete runs. During the four repeatability check runs, do not adjust the system except where necessary to achieve the correct calibration gas flow rate at the analyzer.
              
                13.3.2 Repeatability Check Calculations. Determine the highest and lowest average “measurement data phase” CO concentrations from the four repeatability check runs and record the results on Figure 1 or a similar form. The absolute value of the difference between the maximum and minimum average values recorded must not vary more than ±3 percent or ±1 ppm of the up-scale gas value, whichever is less restrictive.

                (e) The emission rate of particulate matter (PM) from each lime kiln (and each lime cooler if there is a separate exhaust to the atmosphere from the lime cooler) must be computed for each run using Equation 1 of this section:
                
                  ER05JA04.000
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  E = Emission rate of PM, pounds per ton (lb/ton) of stone feed.
                  Ck = Concentration of PM in the kiln effluent, grain/dry standard cubic feet (gr/dscf).
                  Qk = Volumetric flow rate of kiln effluent gas, dry standard cubic feet per hour (dscf/hr).
                  Cc = Concentration of PM in the cooler effluent, grain/dscf. This value is zero if there is not a separate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.
                  Qc = Volumetric flow rate of cooler effluent gas, dscf/hr. This value is zero if there is not a separate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.
                  P = Stone feed rate, tons per hour (ton/hr).
                  K = Conversion factor, 7000 grains per pound (grains/lb).
                
                
                (f)(1) If you choose to meet a weighted average emission limit as specified in item 4 of Table 1 to this subpart, you must calculate a combined particulate emission rate from all kilns and coolers within your LMP using Equation 2 of this section:
                
                  ER05JA04.001
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  ET = Emission rate of PM from all kilns and coolers, lb/ton of stone feed.
                  Ei = Emission rate of PM from kiln i, or from kiln/cooler combination i, lb/ton of stone feed.
                  Pi = Stone feed rate to kiln i, ton/hr.
                  n = Number of kilns you wish to include in averaging.
                
                
                (2) You do not have to include every kiln in this calculation, only include kilns you wish to average. Kilns that have a PM emission limit of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.
                (g) The weighted average PM emission limit from all kilns and coolers for which you are averaging must be calculated using Equation 3 of this section:
                
                  ER05JA04.002

                  ETN = Weighted average PM emission limit for all kilns and coolers being included in averaging at the LMP, lb/ton of stone feed.
                  Ej = PM emission limit (0.10 or 0.12) for kiln j, or for kiln/cooler combination j, lb/ton of stone feed.
                  Pj = Stone feed rate to kiln j, ton/hr.

                  m = Number of kilns and kiln/cooler combinations you are averaging at your LMP. You must include the same kilns in the calculation of ET and ETN. Kilns that have a PM emission limit of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.

                (iii) For target compound(s) not listed in Table 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99, but potentially detected by mass spectrometry, the additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in section 10.5.3 of ASTM D6420-99, is conducted, met, documented, and submitted with the data report, even if there is no moisture condenser used or the compound is not considered water soluble; and
                (iv) For target compound(s) not listed in Table 1.1 of ASTM D6420-99, and not amenable to detection by mass spectrometry, ASTM D6420-99 may not be used.
                (c) It is left to the discretion of the permitting authority whether or not idled kilns must be tested for (HCl) to claim area source status. If the facility has kilns that use common feed materials and fuel, are essentially identical in design, and use essentially identical emission controls, the permitting authority may also determine if one kiln can be tested, and the HCl emissions for the other essentially identical kilns be estimated from that test.

              Emission Standards
              
                § 63.7184
                What emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards must I meet?
                (a) If you have a new, reconstructed, or existing affected source, as defined in § 63.7182(b), you must comply with all applicable emission limitations in this section on and after the compliance dates specified in § 63.7183.
                (b) Process vents—organic HAP emissions. For each organic HAP process vent, other than process vents from storage tanks, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the level specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. These limitations can be met by venting emissions from your process vent through a closed vent system to any combination of control devices meeting the requirements of § 63.982(a)(2).
                (1) Reduce the emissions of organic HAP from the process vent stream by 98 percent by weight.
                (2) Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted organic HAP from the process vent to less than or equal to 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv).
                (c) Process vents—inorganic HAP emissions. For each inorganic HAP process vent, other than process vents from storage tanks, you must limit inorganic HAP emissions to the level specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section. These limitations can be met by venting emissions from your process vent through a closed vent system to a halogen scrubber meeting the requirements of §§ 63.983 (closed vent system requirements) and § 63.994 (halogen scrubber requirements); the applicable general monitoring requirements of § 63.996; the applicable performance test requirements; and the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced therein.
                (1) Reduce the emissions of inorganic HAP from the process vent stream by 95 percent by weight.
                (2) Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted inorganic HAP from the process vent to less than or equal to 0.42 ppmv.
                (d) Storage tanks. For each storage tank, 1,500 gallons or larger, you must limit total HAP emissions to the level specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section if the emissions from the storage tank vent contains greater than 0.42 ppmv inorganic HAP. These limitations can be met by venting emissions from your storage tank through a closed vent system to a halogen scrubber meeting the requirements of §§ 63.983 (closed vent system requirements) and 63.994 (halogen scrubber requirements); the applicable general monitoring requirements of § 63.996; the applicable performance test requirements; and the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced therein.
                (1) Reduce the emissions of inorganic HAP from each storage tank by 95 percent by weight.
                (2) Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted inorganic HAP from the process vent to less than or equal to 0.42 ppmv.

                § 63.7186
                By what date must I conduct performance tests or other initial compliance demonstrations?
                For each process vent or storage tank vent emission limitation in § 63.7184 for which initial compliance is demonstrated by meeting a percent by weight HAP emissions reduction, or a HAP concentration limitation, you must conduct performance tests or an initial compliance demonstration within 180 days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.7183 and according to the provisions in § 63.7(a)(2).
              
              
                § 63.7187
                What performance tests and other compliance procedures must I use?

                (a) You must conduct each performance test in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you as specified for process vents in § 63.982(a)(2) and storage tanks in § 63.982(a)(1). Performance tests must be conducted under maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential. Section 63.982(a)(1) and (2) only includes methods to measure the total organic regulated material or total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. The EPA Methods 26 and 26A are included in Table 1 to this subpart in addition to the test methods contained within § 63.982(a)(1) and (2). The EPA Method 26 or 26A must be used for testing regulated material containing inorganic HAP. Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, must be used to measure total vapor phase organic and inorganic HAP concentrations.
                (b) If, without the use of a control device, your process vent stream has an organic HAP concentration of 20 ppmv or less or an inorganic HAP concentration of 0.42 ppmv or less, or your storage tank vent stream has an inorganic HAP concentration of 0.42 ppmv or less, you may demonstrate that the vent stream is compliant by engineering assessments and calculations or by conducting the applicable performance test requirements specified in Table 1 to this subpart. Your engineering assessments and calculations, as with performance tests (as specified in § 63.982(a)(1) and (2)), must represent your maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential and must be approved by the Administrator. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by certifying that your operations will not exceed the maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential represented by your engineering assessments, calculations, or performance test.
                (c) If you are using a control device to comply with the emission limitations in § 63.7184 and the inlet concentration of HAP to the control device is 20 ppmv or less, then you may demonstrate that the control device meets the percent by weight HAP emission reduction limitation in § 63.7184(c)(1) or (d)(1) by conducting a design evaluation as specified in paragraph (i) of this section. Your design evaluation must represent your maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential and must be approved by the Administrator. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by certifying that your operations will not exceed the maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions potential represented by your design evaluation.
                (d) [Reserved]
                (e) For each monitoring system required in this section, you must develop and submit for approval a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the criteria specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.

                (1) Installation of the continuous monitoring system (CMS) sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control device);
                (2) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction system; and

                (3) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations).
                (f) In your site-specific monitoring plan, you must also address the procedural processes in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(c)(1), (3), (4)(ii), (7), and (8);
                (2) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(d); and
                (3) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).
                (g) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CMS in accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (h) You must operate and maintain the CMS in continuous operation according to the site-specific monitoring plan.
                (i) Design evaluation. To demonstrate that a control device meets the required percent by weight inorganic HAP emission reduction limitation in § 63.7184(c)(1) or (d)(1), a design evaluation must address the composition of the inorganic HAP concentration of the vent stream entering the control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section, depending on the type of control device that is used. If the vent stream is not the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency demonstration must also consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.
                (1) For a condenser, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser must be measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.
                (2) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for carbon beds, design total regeneration stream mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon. For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall be included.
                (3) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon canister, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream mass or volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source operating schedule.
                (4) For a scrubber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration, temperature, and the reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level and will include the additional information in paragraphs (i)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section for trays and a packed column scrubber.
                (i) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;
                (ii) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed section.

                  Combined HAP process vent means a process vent that emits both inorganic and organic HAP to the atmosphere.
                
                  Control device means a combustion device, recovery device, recapture device, or any combination of these devices used for the primary purpose of reducing emissions to comply with this subpart. Devices that are inherent to a process or are integral to the operation of a process are not considered control devices for the purposes of this subpart, even though these devices may have the secondary effect of reducing emissions.
                
                
                  Inorganic HAP process vent means a process vent that emits only inorganic HAP to the atmosphere.
                
                  Organic HAP process vent means a process vent that emits only organic HAP to the atmosphere.
                
                  Process vent means the point at which HAP emissions are released to the atmosphere from a semiconductor manufacturing process unit or storage tank by means of a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent opening. The HAP emission points originating from wastewater treatment equipment, other than storage tanks, are not considered to be a process vent, unless the wastewater treatment equipment emission points are connected to a common vent or exhaust plenum with other process vents.
                
                  Semiconductor manufacturing means the collection of semiconductor manufacturing process units used to manufacture p-type and n-type semiconductors or active solid state devices from a wafer substrate, including processing from crystal growth through wafer fabrication, and testing and assembly. Examples of semiconductor or related solid state devices include semiconductor diodes, semiconductor stacks, rectifiers, integrated circuits, and transistors.
                
                  Semiconductor manufacturing process unit means the collection of equipment used to carry out a discrete operation in the semiconductor manufacturing process. These operations include, but are not limited to, crystal growing; solvent stations used to prepare and clean materials for subsequent processing or for parts cleaning; wet chemical stations used for cleaning (other than solvent cleaning); photoresist application, developing, and stripping; etching; gaseous operation stations used for stripping, cleaning, doping, etching, and layering; separation; encapsulation; and testing. Research and development operations associated with semiconductor manufacturing and conducted at a semiconductor manufacturing facility are considered to be semiconductor manufacturing process units.
                
                  Storage tank means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily from nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic) which provides structural support and is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids or other materials used in or generated by a semiconductor manufacturing process unit. The following are not storage tanks for the purposes of this subpart:
                (1) Tanks permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, railcars, barges, or ships;
                (2) Flow-through tanks where wastewater undergoes treatment (such as pH adjustment) before discharge, and are not used to accumulate wastewater;
                (3) Bottoms receiver tanks; and
                (4) Surge control tanks.

              Emission Limitations and Work Practice Standards
              
                § 63.7290
                What emission limitations must I meet for capture systems and control devices applied to pushing emissions?
                (a) You must not discharge to the atmosphere emissions of particulate matter from a control device applied to pushing emissions from a new or existing coke oven battery that exceed the applicable limit in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:

                [68 FR 18025, Apr. 14, 2003, as amended at 69 FR 60818, Oct. 13, 2004]
              
              
                § 63.7291
                What work practice standards must I meet for fugitive pushing emissions if I have a by-product coke oven battery with vertical flues?
                (a) You must meet each requirement in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section for each new or existing by-product coke oven battery with vertical flues.
                (1) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive pushing emissions from each oven at least once every 90 days. If an oven cannot be observed during a 90-day period due to circumstances that were not reasonably avoidable, you must observe the opacity of the first push of that oven following the close of the 90-day period that is capable of being observed in accordance with the procedures in § 63.7334(a), and you must document why the oven was not observed within a 90-day period. All opacity observations of fugitive pushing emissions for batteries with vertical flues must be made using the procedures in § 63.7334(a).
                (2) If two or more batteries are served by the same pushing equipment and total no more than 90 ovens, the batteries as a unit can be considered a single battery.

                (3) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive pushing emissions for at least four consecutive pushes per battery each day. Exclude any push during which the observer's view is obstructed or obscured by interferences and observe the next available push to complete the set of four pushes. If necessary due to circumstances that were not reasonably avoidable, you may observe fewer than four consecutive pushes in a day; however, you must observe and record as many consecutive pushes as possible and document why four consecutive pushes could not be observed. You may observe and record one or more non-consecutive pushes in addition to any consecutive pushes observed in a day.
                (4) Do not alter the pushing schedule to change the sequence of consecutive pushes to be observed on any day. Keep records indicating the legitimate operational reason for any change in your pushing schedule which results in a change in the sequence of consecutive pushes observed on any day.

                (5) If the average opacity for any individual push exceeds 30 percent opacity for any short battery or 35 percent opacity for any tall battery, you must take corrective action and/or increase coking time for that oven. You must complete corrective action or increase coking time within either 10 calendar days or the number of days determined using Equation 1 of this section, whichever is greater:
                
                X = 0.55 * Y  (Eq. 1)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  X = Number of calendar days allowed to complete corrective action or increase coking time; and
                  Y = Current coking time for the oven, hours.
                
                
                For the purpose of determining the number of calendar days allowed under Equation 1 of this section, day one is the first day following the day you observed an opacity in excess of 30 percent for any short battery or 35 percent for any tall battery. Any fraction produced by Equation 1 of this section must be counted as a whole day. Days during which the oven is removed from service are not included in the number of days allowed to complete corrective action.
                (6)(i) You must demonstrate that the corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful. After a period of time no longer than the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes for the oven capable of being observed using the procedures in § 63.7334(a). The corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful if the average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery. If the corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful, you may return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the corrective action and/or increased coking time was unsuccessful, and you must complete additional corrective action and/or increase coking time for that oven within the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
                (ii) After implementing any additional corrective action and/or increased coking time required under paragraph (a)(6)(i) or (a)(7)(ii) of this section, you must demonstrate that corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful. After a period of time no longer than the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you must observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes for the oven capable of being observed using the procedures in § 63.7334(a). The corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful if the average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery. If the corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful, you may return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the corrective action and/or increased coking time was unsuccessful, and you must follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section.

                (iii) If the corrective action and/or increased coking time was unsuccessful as described in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, you must repeat the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section until the corrective action and/or increased coking time is successful. You must report to the permitting authority as a deviation each unsuccessful attempt at corrective action and/or increased coking time under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
                (7)(i) If at any time you place an oven on increased coking time as a result of fugitive pushing emissions that exceed 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, you must keep the oven on the increased coking time until the oven qualifies for decreased coking time using the procedures in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) or (a)(7)(iii) of this section.
                (ii) To qualify for a decreased coking time for an oven placed on increased coking time in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) or (6) of this section, you must operate the oven on the decreased coking time. After no more than two coking cycles on the decreased coking time, you must observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes that are capable of being observed using the procedures in § 63.7334(a). If the average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery, you may keep the oven on the decreased coking time and return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the attempt to qualify for a decreased coking time was unsuccessful. You must then return the oven to the previously established increased coking time, or implement other corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time. If you implement other corrective action and/or a coking time that is shorter than the previously established increased coking time, you must follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section to confirm that the corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time was successful.
                (iii) If the attempt to qualify for decreased coking time was unsuccessful as described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section, you may again attempt to qualify for decreased coking time for the oven. To do this, you must operate the oven on the decreased coking time. After no more than two coking cycles on the decreased coking time, you must observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes that are capable of being observed using the procedures in § 63.7334(a). If the average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery, you may keep the oven on the decreased coking time and return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the attempt to qualify for a decreased coking time was unsuccessful. You must then return the oven to the previously established increased coking time, or implement other corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time. If you implement other corrective action and/or a coking time that is shorter than the previously established increased coking time, you must follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section to confirm that the corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time was successful.
                (iv) You must report to the permitting authority as a deviation the second and any subsequent consecutive unsuccessful attempts on the same oven to qualify for decreased coking time as described in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section.
                (b) As provided in § 63.6(g), you may request to use an alternative to the work practice standards in paragraph (a) of this section.
              
              
                § 63.7292
                What work practice standards must I meet for fugitive pushing emissions if I have a by-product coke oven battery with horizontal flues?
                (a) You must comply with each of the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.

                (1) Prepare and operate by a written plan that will eliminate or minimize incomplete coking for each by-product coke oven battery with horizontal flues. You must submit the plan and supporting documentation to the Administrator (or delegated authority) for approval no later than 90 days after completing all observations and measurements required for the study in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or April 14, 2004, whichever is earlier. You must begin operating by the plan requirements by the compliance date that is specified in § 63.7283. The written plan must identify minimum flue temperatures for different coking times and a battery-wide minimum acceptable flue temperature for any oven at any coking time.
                (2) Submit the written plan and supporting documentation to the Administrator (or delegated authority) for review and approval. Include all data collected during the study described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. If the Administrator (or delegated authority) disapproves the plan, you must revise the plan as directed by the Administrator (or delegated authority) and submit the amended plan for approval. The Administrator (or delegated authority) may require you to collect and submit additional data. You must operate according to your submitted plan (or submitted amended plan, if any) until the Administrator (or delegated authority) approves your plan.
                (3) You must base your written plan on a study that you conduct that meets each of the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (x) of this section.
                (i) Initiate the study by July 14, 2003. Notify the Administrator (or delegated authority) at least 7 days prior to initiating the study according to the requirements in § 63.7340(f).
                (ii) Conduct the study under representative operating conditions, including but not limited to the range of moisture content and volatile matter in the coal that is charged.
                (iii) Include every oven in the study and observe at least two pushes from each oven.
                (iv) For each push observed, measure and record the temperature of every flue within 2 hours before the scheduled pushing time. Document the oven number, date, and time the oven was charged and pushed, and calculate the net coking time.
                (v) For each push observed, document the factors to be used to identify pushes that are incompletely coked. These factors must include (but are not limited to): average opacity during the push, average opacity during travel to the quench tower, average of six highest consecutive observations during both push and travel, highest single opacity reading, color of the emissions (especially noting any yellow or brown emissions), presence of excessive smoke during travel to the quench tower, percent volatile matter in the coke, percent volatile matter and percent moisture in the coal that is charged, and the date the oven was last rebuilt or completely relined. Additional documentation may be provided in the form of pictures or videotape of emissions during the push and travel. All opacity observations must be conducted in accordance with the procedures in § 63.7334(a)(3) through (7).
                (vi) Inspect the inside walls of the oven after each observed push for cool spots as indicated by a flue that is darker than others (the oven walls should be red hot) and record the results.

                (vii) For each push observed, note where incomplete coking occurs if possible (e.g., coke side end, pusher side end, top, or center of the coke mass). For any push with incomplete coking, investigate and document the probable cause.
                (viii) Use the documented factors in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section to identify pushes that were completely coked and those that were not completely coked. Provide a rationale for the determination based on the documentation of factors observed during the study.
                (ix) Use only the flue temperature and coking time data for pushes that were completely coked to identify minimum flue temperatures for various coking times. Submit the criteria used to determine complete coking, as well as a table of coking times and corresponding temperatures for complete coking as part of your plan.
                (x) Determine the battery-wide minimum acceptable flue temperature for any oven. This temperature will be equal to the lowest temperature that provided complete coking as determined in paragraph (a)(3)(ix) of this section.

                (4) You must operate according to the coking times and temperatures in your approved plan and the requirements in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (viii) of this section.
                
                (i) Measure and record the percent volatile matter in the coal that is charged.
                (ii) Measure and record the temperature of all flues on two ovens per day within 2 hours before the scheduled pushing time for each oven. Measure and record the temperature of all flues on each oven at least once each month.
                (iii) For each oven observed in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, record the time each oven is charged and pushed and calculate and record the net coking time. If any measured flue temperature for an oven is below the minimum flue temperature for an oven's scheduled coking time as established in the written plan, increase the coking time for the oven to the coking time in the written plan for the observed flue temperature before pushing the oven.
                (iv) If you increased the coking time for any oven in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, you must investigate the cause of the low flue temperature and take corrective action to fix the problem. You must continue to measure and record the temperature of all flues for the oven within 2 hours before each scheduled pushing time until the measurements meet the minimum temperature requirements for the increased coking time for two consecutive pushes. If any measured flue temperature for an oven on increased coking time falls below the minimum flue temperature for the increased coking time, as established in the written plan, you must increase the coking time for the oven to the coking time specified in the written plan for the observed flue temperature before pushing the oven. The oven must continue to operate at this coking time (or at a longer coking time if the temperature falls below the minimum allowed for the increased coking time) until the problem has been corrected, and you have confirmed that the corrective action was successful as required by paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section.
                (v) Once the heating problem has been corrected, the oven may be returned to the battery's normal coking schedule. You must then measure and record the flue temperatures for the oven within 2 hours before the scheduled pushing time for the next two consecutive pushes. If any flue temperature measurement is below the minimum flue temperature for that coking time established in the written plan, repeat the procedures in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
                (vi) If any flue temperature measurement is below the battery-wide minimum acceptable temperature for complete coking established in the written plan for any oven at any coking time, you must remove the oven from service for repairs.
                (vii) For an oven that has been repaired and returned to service after being removed from service in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section, you must measure and record the temperatures of all flues for the oven within 2 hours before the first scheduled pushing time. If any flue temperature measurement is below the minimum flue temperature for the scheduled coking time, as established in the written plan, you must repeat the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
                (viii) For an oven that has been repaired and returned to service after removal from service in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section, you must report as a deviation to the permitting authority any flue temperature measurement made during the initial coking cycle after return to service that is below the lowest acceptable minimum flue temperature.
                (b) As provided in § 63.6(g), you may request to use an alternative to the work practice standards in paragraph (a) of this section.
              
              
                § 63.7293
                What work practice standards must I meet for fugitive pushing emissions if I have a non-recovery coke oven battery?
                (a) You must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for each new and existing non-recovery coke oven battery.
                (1) You must visually inspect each oven prior to pushing by opening the door damper and observing the bed of coke.

                (2) Do not push the oven unless the visual inspection indicates that there is no smoke in the open space above the coke bed and that there is an unobstructed view of the door on the opposite side of the oven.
                (b) As provided in § 63.6(g), you may request to use an alternative to the work practice standard in paragraph (a) of this section.
              
              
                § 63.7294
                What work practice standard must I meet for soaking?
                (a) For each new and existing by-product coke oven battery, you must prepare and operate at all times according to a written work practice plan for soaking. Each plan must include measures and procedures to:

                (2) Damper the oven off the collecting main prior to opening the standpipe cap.
                (3) Determine the cause of soaking emissions that do not ignite automatically, including emissions that result from raw coke oven gas leaking from the collecting main through the damper, and emissions that result from incomplete coking.
                (4) If soaking emissions are caused by leaks from the collecting main, take corrective actions to eliminate the soaking emissions. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, reseating the damper, cleaning the flushing liquor piping, using aspiration, putting the oven back on the collecting main, or igniting the emissions.
                (5) If soaking emissions are not caused by leaks from the collecting main, notify a designated responsible party. The responsible party must determine whether the soaking emissions are due to incomplete coking. If incomplete coking is the cause of the soaking emissions, you must put the oven back on the collecting main until it is completely coked or you must ignite the emissions.
                (b) As provided in § 63.6(g), you may request to use an alternative to the work practice standard in paragraph (a) of this section.

                § 63.7334
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the work practice standards that apply to me?
                (a) For each by-product coke oven battery with vertical flues subject to the work practice standards for fugitive pushing emissions in § 63.7291(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance according to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section:
                (1) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive emissions for four consecutive pushes per operating day, except you may make fewer or non-consecutive observations as permitted by § 63.7291(a)(3). Maintain records of the pushing schedule for each oven and records indicating the legitimate operational reason for any change in the pushing schedule according to § 63.7291(a)(4).
                (2) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive emissions from each oven in a battery at least once every 90 days. If an oven cannot be observed during a 90-day period, observe and record the opacity of the first push of that oven following the close of the 90-day period that can be read in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section.
                (3) Make all observations and calculations for opacity observations of fugitive pushing emissions in accordance with Method 9 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 using a Method 9 certified observer unless you have an approved alternative procedure under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
                (4) Record pushing opacity observations at 15-second intervals as required in section 2.4 of Method 9 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). The requirement in section 2.4 of Method 9 for a minimum of 24 observations does not apply, and the data reduction requirements in section 2.5 of Method 9 do not apply. The requirement in § 63.6(h)(5)(ii)(B) for obtaining at least 3 hours of observations (thirty 6-minute averages) to demonstrate initial compliance does not apply.

                (5) If fewer than six but at least four 15-second observations can be made, use the average of the total number of observations to calculate average opacity for the push. Missing one or more observations during the push (e.g., as the quench car passes behind a building) does not invalidate the observations before or after the interference for that push. However, a minimum of four 15-second readings must be made for a valid observation.
                (6) Begin observations for a push at the first detectable movement of the coke mass. End observations of a push when the quench car enters the quench tower.
                (i) For a battery without a cokeside shed, observe fugitive pushing emissions from a position at least 10 meters from the quench car that provides an unobstructed view and avoids interferences from the topside of the battery. This may require the observer to be positioned at an angle to the quench car rather than perpendicular to it. Typical interferences to avoid include emissions from open standpipes and charging. Observe the opacity of emissions above the battery top with the sky as the background where possible. Record the oven number of any push not observed because of obstructions or interferences.

                (ii) For a battery with a cokeside shed, the observer must be in a position that provides an unobstructed view and avoids interferences from the topside of the battery. Typical interferences to avoid include emissions from open standpipes and charging. Observations must include any fugitive emissions that escape from the top of the shed, from the ends of the shed, or from the area where the shed is joined to the battery. If the observer does not have a clear view to identify when a push starts or ends, a second person can be positioned to signal the start or end of the push and notify the observer when to start or end the observations. Radio communications with other plant personnel (e.g., pushing ram operator or quench car operator) may also serve to notify the observer of the start or end of a push. Record the oven number of any push not observed because of obstructions or interferences.
                (iii) You may reposition after the push to observe emissions during travel if necessary.
                (7) If it is infeasible to implement the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section for an oven due to physical obstructions, nighttime pushes, or other reasons, you may apply to your permitting authority for permission to use an alternative procedure. The application must provide a detailed explanation of why it is infeasible to use the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section, identify the oven and battery numbers, and describe the alternative procedure. An alternative procedure must identify whether the coke in that oven is not completely coked, either before, during, or after an oven is pushed.
                (8) For each oven observed that exceeds an opacity of 30 percent for any short battery or 35 percent for any tall battery, you must take corrective action and/or increase the coking time in accordance with § 63.7291(a). Maintain records documenting conformance with the requirements in § 63.7291(a).
                (b) For each by-product coke oven battery with horizontal flues subject to the work practice standards for fugitive pushing emissions in § 63.7292(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by having met the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section:
                (1) Measuring and recording the temperature of all flues on two ovens per day within 2 hours before the oven's scheduled pushing time and ensuring that the temperature of each oven is measured and recorded at least once every month;
                (2) Recording the time each oven is charged and pushed and calculating and recording the net coking time for each oven; and
                (3) Increasing the coking time for each oven that falls below the minimum flue temperature trigger established for that oven's coking time in the written plan required in § 63.7292(a)(1), assigning the oven to the oven-directed program, and recording all relevant information according to the requirements in § 63.7292(a)(4) including, but not limited to, daily pushing schedules, diagnostic procedures, corrective actions, and oven repairs.
                (c) For each non-recovery coke oven battery subject to the work practice standards in § 63.7293(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by maintaining records that document each visual inspection of an oven prior to pushing and that the oven was not pushed unless there was no smoke in the open space above the coke bed and there was an unobstructed view of the door on the opposite side of the oven.
                (d) For each by-product coke oven battery subject to the work practice standard for soaking in § 63.7294(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by maintaining records that document conformance with requirements in § 63.7294(a)(1) through (5).
                (e) For each coke oven battery subject to the work practice standard for quenching in § 63.7295(b), you must demonstrate continuous compliance according to the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section:
                (1) Maintaining baffles in each quench tower such that no more than 5 percent of the cross-sectional area of the tower is uncovered or open to the sky as required in § 63.7295(b)(1);
                (2) Maintaining records that document conformance with the washing, inspection, and repair requirements in § 63.7295(b)(2), including records of the ambient temperature on any day that the baffles were not washed; and
                (3) Maintaining records of the source of makeup water to document conformance with the requirement for acceptable makeup water in § 63.7295(a)(2).
              
              
                § 63.7335
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the operation and maintenance requirements that apply to me?

                (a) For each by-product coke oven battery, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the operation and maintenance requirements in § 63.7300(b) by adhering at all times to the plan requirements and recording all information needed to document conformance.
                
                (b) For each coke oven battery with a capture system or control device applied to pushing emissions, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the operation and maintenance requirements in § 63.7300(c) by meeting the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section:
                (1) Making monthly inspections of capture systems according to § 63.7300(c)(1) and recording all information needed to document conformance with these requirements;
                (2) Performing preventative maintenance for each control device according to § 63.7300(c)(2) and recording all information needed to document conformance with these requirements; and
                (3) Initiating and completing corrective action for a bag leak detection system alarm according to § 63.7300(c)(3) and recording all information needed to document conformance with these requirements. This includes records of the times the bag leak detection system alarm sounds, and for each valid alarm, the time you initiated corrective action, the corrective action(s) taken, and the date on which corrective action is completed.
                (c) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the operation and maintenance requirements for a baghouse applied to pushing emissions from a coke oven battery in § 63.7331(a), you must inspect and maintain each baghouse according to the requirements in § 63.7331(a)(1) through (8) and record all information needed to document conformance with these requirements. If you increase or decrease the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system beyond the limits specified in § 63.7331(a)(6), you must include a copy of the required written certification by a responsible official in the next semiannual compliance report.
                (d) You must maintain a current copy of the operation and maintenance plans required in § 63.7300(b) and (c) onsite and available for inspection upon request. You must keep the plans for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the requirements of this subpart.

                What other requirements must I meet to demonstrate continuous compliance?
                (a) Deviations. You must report each instance in which you did not meet each emission limitation in this subpart that applies to you. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. You must also report each instance in which you did not meet each work practice standard or operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you. These instances are deviations from the emission limitations (including operating limits), work practice standards, and operation and maintenance requirements in this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.7341.
                (b) Startup, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (1) Consistent with §§ 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with § 63.6(e)(1).
                (2) The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, according to the provisions in § 63.6(e).

                (8) For each deviation from an emission limitation occurring at an affected source where you are using a continuous monitoring system (including COMS, CEMS, or CPMS) to comply with the emission limitation in this subpart, you must include the information in paragraphs (c)(4) and (8)(i) through (xii) of this section. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
                (i) The date and time that each malfunction started and stopped.
                (ii) The date and time that each continuous monitoring system (including COMS, CEMS, or CPMS) was inoperative, except for zero (low-level) and high-level checks.
                (iii) The date, time, and duration that each continuous monitoring system (including COMS, CEMS, or CPMS) was out-of-control, including the information in § 63.8(c)(8).
                (iv) The date and time that each deviation started and stopped, and whether each deviation occurred during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction or during another period.
                (v) A summary of the total duration of the deviation during the reporting period and the total duration as a percent of the total source operating time during that reporting period.
                (vi) A breakdown of the total duration of the deviations during the reporting period into those that are due to startup, shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, and other unknown causes.
                (vii) A summary of the total duration of continuous monitoring system downtime during the reporting period and the total duration of continuous monitoring system downtime as a percent of the total source operating time during the reporting period.
                (viii) An identification of each HAP that was monitored at the affected source.
                (ix) A brief description of the process units.

                (xi) The date of the latest continuous monitoring system certification or audit.
                (xii) A description of any changes in continuous monitoring systems, processes, or controls since the last reporting period.
                (d) Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. If you had a startup, shutdown, or malfunction during the semiannual reporting period that was not consistent with your startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, you must submit an immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction report according to the requirements in § 63.10(d)(5)(ii).
                (e) Part 70 monitoring report. If you have obtained a title V operating permit for an affected source pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, you must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If you submit a compliance report for an affected source along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the compliance report includes all the required information concerning deviations from any emission limitation or work practice standard in this subpart, submission of the compliance report satisfies any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a compliance report does not otherwise affect any obligation you may have to report deviations from permit requirements to your permitting authority.

                § 63.7500
                What emission limitations, work practice standards, and operating limits must I meet?
                (a) You must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (b), through (e) of this section. You must meet these requirements at all times the affected unit is operating, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
                (1) You must meet each emission limit and work practice standard in Tables 1 through 3, and 11 through 13 to this subpart that applies to your boiler or process heater, for each boiler or process heater at your source, except as provided under § 63.7522. The output-based emission limits, in units of pounds per million Btu of steam output, in Tables 1 or 2 to this subpart are an alternative applicable only to boilers and process heaters that generate either steam, cogenerate steam with electricity, or both. The output-based emission limits, in units of pounds per megawatt-hour, in Tables 1 or 2 to this subpart are an alternative applicable only to boilers that generate only electricity. Boilers that perform multiple functions (cogeneration and electricity generation) or supply steam to common headers would calculate a total steam energy output using equation 21 of § 63.7575 to demonstrate compliance with the output-based emission limits, in units of pounds per million Btu of steam output, in Tables 1 or 2 to this subpart. If you operate a new boiler or process heater, you can choose to comply with alternative limits as discussed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, but on or after January 31, 2016, you must comply with the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart.
                (i) If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction after June 4, 2010 and before May 20, 2011, you may comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 11 to this subpart until January 31, 2016.
                (ii) If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction on or after May 20, 2011 and before December 23, 2011, you may comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 12 to this subpart until January 31, 2016.
                (iii) If your boiler or process heater commenced construction or reconstruction on or after December 23, 2011 and before April 1, 2013, you may comply with the emission limits in Table 1 or 13 to this subpart until January 31, 2016.

                (2) You must meet each operating limit in Table 4 to this subpart that applies to your boiler or process heater. If you use a control device or combination of control devices not covered in Table 4 to this subpart, or you wish to establish and monitor an alternative operating limit or an alternative monitoring parameter, you must apply to the EPA Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).
                (3) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source (as defined in § 63.7490), including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
                (b) As provided in § 63.6(g), EPA may approve use of an alternative to the work practice standards in this section.
                (c) Limited-use boilers and process heaters must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in § 63.7540. They are not subject to the emission limits in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, the annual tune-up, or the energy assessment requirements in Table 3 to this subpart, or the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart.
                (d) Boilers and process heaters with a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour in the units designed to burn gas 2 (other) fuels subcategory or units designed to burn light liquid fuels subcategory must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in § 63.7540.
                (e) Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory with a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour must complete a tune-up every 5 years as specified in § 63.7540. Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory with a heat input capacity greater than 5 million Btu per hour and less than 10 million Btu per hour must complete a tune-up every 2 years as specified in § 63.7540. Boilers and process heaters in the units designed to burn gas 1 fuels subcategory are not subject to the emission limits in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, or the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart.
                (f) These standards apply at all times the affected unit is operating, except during periods of startup and shutdown during which time you must comply only with items 5 and 6 of Table 3 to this subpart.

You may demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit for hydrogen chloride (HCl), mercury, or total selected metals (TSM) using fuel analysis if the emission rate calculated according to § 63.7530(c) is less than the applicable emission limit. (For gaseous fuels, you may not use fuel analyses to comply with the TSM alternative standard or the HCl standard.) Otherwise, you must demonstrate compliance for HCl, mercury, or TSM using performance stack testing, if subject to an applicable emission limit listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart.

                (d) If you demonstrate compliance with any applicable emission limit through performance testing and subsequent compliance with operating limits through the use of CPMS, or with a CEMS or COMS, you must develop a site-specific monitoring plan according to the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section for the use of any CEMS, COMS, or CPMS. This requirement also applies to you if you petition the EPA Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters under § 63.8(f).
                (1) For each CMS required in this section (including CEMS, COMS, or CPMS), you must develop, and submit to the Administrator for approval upon request, a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses design, data collection, and the quality assurance and quality control elements outlined in § 63.8(d) and the elements described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. You must submit this site-specific monitoring plan, if requested, at least 60 days before your initial performance evaluation of your CMS. This requirement to develop and submit a site specific monitoring plan does not apply to affected sources with existing CEMS or COMS operated according to the performance specifications under appendix B to part 60 of this chapter and that meet the requirements of § 63.7525. Using the process described in § 63.8(f)(4), you may request approval of alternative monitoring system quality assurance and quality control procedures in place of those specified in this paragraph and, if approved, include the alternatives in your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (i) Installation of the CMS sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control device);
                (ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction systems; and
                (iii) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations, accuracy audits, analytical drift).
                (2) In your site-specific monitoring plan, you must also address paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(c)(1)(ii), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii);
                (ii) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(d); and
                (iii) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.10(c) (as applicable in Table 10 to this subpart), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).
                (3) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CMS in accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (4) You must operate and maintain the CMS in continuous operation according to the site-specific monitoring plan.
                (e) If you have an applicable emission limit, and you choose to comply using definition (2) of “startup” in § 63.7575, you must develop and implement a written startup and shutdown plan (SSP) according to the requirements in Table 3 to this subpart. The SSP must be maintained onsite and available upon request for public inspection.

              Testing, Fuel Analyses, and Initial Compliance Requirements
              
                § 63.7510
                What are my initial compliance requirements and by what date must I conduct them?
                (a) For each boiler or process heater that is required or that you elect to demonstrate compliance with any of the applicable emission limits in Tables 1 or 2 or 11 through 13 of this subpart through performance (stack) testing, your initial compliance requirements include all the following:
                (1) Conduct performance tests according to § 63.7520 and Table 5 to this subpart.
                (2) Conduct a fuel analysis for each type of fuel burned in your boiler or process heater according to § 63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.

                (i) For each boiler or process heater that burns a single type of fuel, you are not required to conduct a fuel analysis for each type of fuel burned in your boiler or process heater according to § 63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart. For purposes of this subpart, units that use a supplemental fuel only for startup, unit shutdown, and transient flame stability purposes still qualify as units that burn a single type of fuel, and the supplemental fuel is not subject to the fuel analysis requirements under § 63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart.
                (ii) When natural gas, refinery gas, or other gas 1 fuels are co-fired with other fuels, you are not required to conduct a fuel analysis of those Gas 1 fuels according to § 63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart. If gaseous fuels other than natural gas, refinery gas, or other gas 1 fuels are co-fired with other fuels and those non-Gas 1 gaseous fuels are subject to another subpart of this part, part 60, part 61, or part 65, you are not required to conduct a fuel analysis of those non-Gas 1 fuels according to § 63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart.
                (iii) You are not required to conduct a chlorine fuel analysis for any gaseous fuels. You must conduct a fuel analysis for mercury on gaseous fuels unless the fuel is exempted in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
                (3) Establish operating limits according to § 63.7530 and Table 7 to this subpart.
                (4) Conduct CMS performance evaluations according to § 63.7525.
                (b) For each boiler or process heater that you elect to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits in Tables 1 or 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart for HCl, mercury, or TSM through fuel analysis, your initial compliance requirement is to conduct a fuel analysis for each type of fuel burned in your boiler or process heater according to § 63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart and establish operating limits according to § 63.7530 and Table 8 to this subpart. The fuels described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are exempt from these fuel analysis and operating limit requirements. The fuels described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section are exempt from the chloride fuel analysis and operating limit requirements. Boilers and process heaters that use a CEMS for mercury or HCl are exempt from the performance testing and operating limit requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section for the HAP for which CEMS are used.
                (c) If your boiler or process heater is subject to a carbon monoxide (CO) limit, your initial compliance demonstration for CO is to conduct a performance test for CO according to Table 5 to this subpart or conduct a performance evaluation of your continuous CO monitor, if applicable, according to § 63.7525(a). Boilers and process heaters that use a CO CEMS to comply with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission standard listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, as specified in § 63.7525(a), are exempt from the initial CO performance testing and oxygen concentration operating limit requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
                (d) If your boiler or process heater is subject to a PM limit, your initial compliance demonstration for PM is to conduct a performance test in accordance with § 63.7520 and Table 5 to this subpart.
                (e) For existing affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490), you must complete the initial compliance demonstrations, as specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, no later than 180 days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.7495 and according to the applicable provisions in § 63.7(a)(2) as cited in Table 10 to this subpart, except as specified in paragraph (j) of this section. You must complete an initial tune-up by following the procedures described in § 63.7540(a)(10)(i) through (vi) no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.7495, except as specified in paragraph (j) of this section. You must complete the one-time energy assessment specified in Table 3 to this subpart no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.7495.

                (f) For new or reconstructed affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490), you must complete the initial compliance demonstration with the emission limits no later than July 30, 2013 or within 180 days after startup of the source, whichever is later. If you are demonstrating compliance with an emission limit in Tables 11 through 13 to this subpart that is less stringent (that is, higher) than the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in Table 1 no later than July 29, 2016.
                (g) For new or reconstructed affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490), you must demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable work practice standards in Table 3 to this subpart within the applicable annual, biennial, or 5-year schedule as specified in § 63.7515(d) following the initial compliance date specified in § 63.7495(a). Thereafter, you are required to complete the applicable annual, biennial, or 5-year tune-up as specified in § 63.7515(d).
                (h) For affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490) that ceased burning solid waste consistent with § 63.7495(e) and for which the initial compliance date has passed, you must demonstrate compliance within 60 days of the effective date of the waste-to-fuel switch. If you have not conducted your compliance demonstration for this subpart within the previous 12 months, you must complete all compliance demonstrations for this subpart before you commence or recommence combustion of solid waste.
                (i) For an existing EGU that becomes subject after January 31, 2016, you must demonstrate compliance within 180 days after becoming an affected source.
                (j) For existing affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490) that have not operated between the effective date of the rule and the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.7495, you must complete the initial compliance demonstration, if subject to the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart, as specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, no later than 180 days after the re-start of the affected source and according to the applicable provisions in § 63.7(a)(2) as cited in Table 10 to this subpart. You must complete an initial tune-up by following the procedures described in § 63.7540(a)(10)(i) through (vi) no later than 30 days after the re-start of the affected source and, if applicable, complete the one-time energy assessment specified in Table 3 to this subpart, no later than the compliance date specified in § 63.7495.
                (k) For affected sources, as defined in § 63.7490, that switch subcategories consistent with § 63.7545(h) after the initial compliance date, you must demonstrate compliance within 60 days of the effective date of the switch, unless you had previously conducted your compliance demonstration for this subcategory within the previous 12 months.

                (b) If your performance tests for a given pollutant for at least 2 consecutive years show that your emissions are at or below 75 percent of the emission limit (or, in limited instances as specified in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, at or below the emission limit) for the pollutant, and if there are no changes in the operation of the individual boiler or process heater or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year. Each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test. If you elect to demonstrate compliance using emission averaging under § 63.7522, you must continue to conduct performance tests annually. The requirement to test at maximum chloride input level is waived unless the stack test is conducted for HCl. The requirement to test at maximum mercury input level is waived unless the stack test is conducted for mercury. The requirement to test at maximum TSM input level is waived unless the stack test is conducted for TSM.

                (c) If a performance test shows emissions exceeded the emission limit or 75 percent of the emission limit (as specified in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart) for a pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over a consecutive 2-year period meet the required level (at or below 75 percent of the emission limit, as specified in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart).
                (d) If you are required to meet an applicable tune-up work practice standard, you must conduct an annual, biennial, or 5-year performance tune-up according to § 63.7540(a)(10), (11), or (12), respectively. Each annual tune-up specified in § 63.7540(a)(10) must be no more than 13 months after the previous tune-up. Each biennial tune-up specified in § 63.7540(a)(11) must be conducted no more than 25 months after the previous tune-up. Each 5-year tune-up specified in § 63.7540(a)(12) must be conducted no more than 61 months after the previous tune-up. For a new or reconstructed affected source (as defined in § 63.7490), the first annual, biennial, or 5-year tune-up must be no later than 13 months, 25 months, or 61 months, respectively, after April 1, 2013 or the initial startup of the new or reconstructed affected source, whichever is later.
                (e) If you demonstrate compliance with the mercury, HCl, or TSM based on fuel analysis, you must conduct a monthly fuel analysis according to § 63.7521 for each type of fuel burned that is subject to an emission limit in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart. You may comply with this monthly requirement by completing the fuel analysis any time within the calendar month as long as the analysis is separated from the previous analysis by at least 14 calendar days. If you burn a new type of fuel, you must conduct a fuel analysis before burning the new type of fuel in your boiler or process heater. You must still meet all applicable continuous compliance requirements in § 63.7540. If each of 12 consecutive monthly fuel analyses demonstrates 75 percent or less of the compliance level, you may decrease the fuel analysis frequency to quarterly for that fuel. If any quarterly sample exceeds 75 percent of the compliance level or you begin burning a new type of fuel, you must return to monthly monitoring for that fuel, until 12 months of fuel analyses are again less than 75 percent of the compliance level. If sampling is conducted on one day per month, samples should be no less than 14 days apart, but if multiple samples are taken per month, the 14-day restriction does not apply.
                (f) You must report the results of performance tests and the associated fuel analyses within 60 days after the completion of the performance tests. This report must also verify that the operating limits for each boiler or process heater have not changed or provide documentation of revised operating limits established according to § 63.7530 and Table 7 to this subpart, as applicable. The reports for all subsequent performance tests must include all applicable information required in § 63.7550.
                (g) For affected sources (as defined in § 63.7490) that have not operated since the previous compliance demonstration and more than one year has passed since the previous compliance demonstration, you must complete the subsequent compliance demonstration, if subject to the emission limits in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, no later than 180 days after the re-start of the affected source and according to the applicable provisions in § 63.7(a)(2) as cited in Table 10 to this subpart. You must complete a subsequent tune-up by following the procedures described in § 63.7540(a)(10)(i) through (vi) and the schedule described in § 63.7540(a)(13) for units that are not operating at the time of their scheduled tune-up.

                (h) If your affected boiler or process heater is in the unit designed to burn light liquid subcategory and you combust ultra-low sulfur liquid fuel, you do not need to conduct further performance tests (stack tests or fuel analyses) if the pollutants measured during the initial compliance performance tests meet the emission limits in Tables 1 or 2 of this subpart providing you demonstrate ongoing compliance with the emissions limits by monitoring and recording the type of fuel combusted on a monthly basis. If you intend to use a fuel other than ultra-low sulfur liquid fuel, natural gas, refinery gas, or other gas 1 fuel, you must conduct new performance tests within 60 days of burning the new fuel type.
                
                (i) If you operate a CO CEMS that meets the Performance Specifications outlined in § 63.7525(a)(3) of this subpart to demonstrate compliance with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission standard listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, you are not required to conduct CO performance tests and are not subject to the oxygen concentration operating limit requirement specified in § 63.7510(a).

                (a) You must conduct all performance tests according to § 63.7(c), (d), (f), and (h). You must also develop a site-specific stack test plan according to the requirements in § 63.7(c). You shall conduct all performance tests under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to you based on the representative performance of each boiler or process heater for the period being tested. Upon request, you shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests.
                (b) You must conduct each performance test according to the requirements in Table 5 to this subpart.
                (c) You must conduct each performance test under the specific conditions listed in Tables 5 and 7 to this subpart. You must conduct performance tests at representative operating load conditions while burning the type of fuel or mixture of fuels that has the highest content of chlorine and mercury, and TSM if you are opting to comply with the TSM alternative standard and you must demonstrate initial compliance and establish your operating limits based on these performance tests. These requirements could result in the need to conduct more than one performance test. Following each performance test and until the next performance test, you must comply with the operating limit for operating load conditions specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
                (d) You must conduct a minimum of three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in § 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must comply with the minimum applicable sampling times or volumes specified in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart.
                (e) To determine compliance with the emission limits, you must use the F-Factor methodology and equations in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of EPA Method 19 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 of this chapter to convert the measured particulate matter (PM) concentrations, the measured HCl concentrations, the measured mercury concentrations, and the measured TSM concentrations that result from the performance test to pounds per million Btu heat input emission rates.
                (f) Except for a 30-day rolling average based on CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) data, if measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection level (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the method defined analytical detection level), you must use the method detection level as the measured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating compliance. The measured result for a multiple component analysis (e.g., analytical values for multiple Method 29 fractions both for individual HAP metals and for total HAP metals) may include a combination of method detection level data and analytical data reported above the method detection level.

If the affected source elects to collect monthly data for up the 11 months preceding the first monthly period, these additional data points can be used to compute the 12-month rolling average in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

                (1) For each calendar month, you must use Equation 3a or 3b or 3c of this section to calculate the average weighted emission rate for that month. Use Equation 3a and the actual heat input for the month for each existing unit participating in the emissions averaging option if you are complying with emission limits on a heat input basis.

                § 63.7525
                What are my monitoring, installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?

                (a) If your boiler or process heater is subject to a CO emission limit in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, you must install, operate, and maintain an oxygen analyzer system, as defined in § 63.7575, or install, certify, operate and maintain continuous emission monitoring systems for CO and oxygen (or carbon dioxide (CO2)) according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section.
                (1) Install the CO CEMS and oxygen (or CO2) analyzer by the compliance date specified in § 63.7495. The CO and oxygen (or CO2) levels shall be monitored at the same location at the outlet of the boiler or process heater. An owner or operator may request an alternative test method under § 63.7 of this chapter, in order that compliance with the CO emissions limit be determined using CO2 as a diluent correction in place of oxygen at 3 percent. EPA Method 19 F-factors and EPA Method 19 equations must be used to generate the appropriate CO2 correction percentage for the fuel type burned in the unit, and must also take into account that the 3 percent oxygen correction is to be done on a dry basis. The alternative test method request must account for any CO2 being added to, or removed from, the emissions gas stream as a result of limestone injection, scrubber media, etc.

                (2) To demonstrate compliance with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission standard listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, you must install, certify, operate, and maintain a CO CEMS and an oxygen analyzer according to the applicable procedures under Performance Specification 4, 4A, or 4B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B; part 75 of this chapter (if an CO2 analyzer is used); the site-specific monitoring plan developed according to § 63.7505(d); and the requirements in § 63.7540(a)(8) and paragraph (a) of this section. Any boiler or process heater that has a CO CEMS that is compliant with Performance Specification 4, 4A, or 4B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, a site-specific monitoring plan developed according to § 63.7505(d), and the requirements in § 63.7540(a)(8) and paragraph (a) of this section must use the CO CEMS to comply with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission standard listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart.
                
                (i) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CO CEMS according to the requirements in § 63.8(e) and according to Performance Specification 4, 4A, or 4B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
                (ii) During each relative accuracy test run of the CO CEMS, you must be collect emission data for CO concurrently (or within a 30- to 60-minute period) by both the CO CEMS and by Method 10, 10A, or 10B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4. The relative accuracy testing must be at representative operating conditions.
                (iii) You must follow the quality assurance procedures (e.g., quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests) of Procedure 1 of appendix F to part 60. The measurement span value of the CO CEMS must be two times the applicable CO emission limit, expressed as a concentration.
                (iv) Any CO CEMS that does not comply with § 63.7525(a) cannot be used to meet any requirement in this subpart to demonstrate compliance with a CO emission limit listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart.
                (v) For a new unit, complete the initial performance evaluation no later than July 30, 2013, or 180 days after the date of initial startup, whichever is later. For an existing unit, complete the initial performance evaluation no later than July 29, 2016.
                (vi) When CO2 is used to correct CO emissions and CO2 is measured on a wet basis, correct for moisture as follows: Install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system for measuring and recording the moisture content of the flue gases, in order to correct the measured hourly volumetric flow rates for moisture when calculating CO concentrations. The following continuous moisture monitoring systems are acceptable: A continuous moisture sensor; an oxygen analyzer (or analyzers) capable of measuring O2 both on a wet basis and on a dry basis; or a stack temperature sensor and a moisture look-up table, i.e., a psychrometric chart (for saturated gas streams following wet scrubbers or other demonstrably saturated gas streams, only). The moisture monitoring system shall include as a component the automated data acquisition and handling system (DAHS) for recording and reporting both the raw data (e.g., hourly average wet-and dry basis O2 values) and the hourly average values of the stack gas moisture content derived from those data. When a moisture look-up table is used, the moisture monitoring system shall be represented as a single component, the certified DAHS, in the monitoring plan for the unit or common stack.

                (3) Complete a minimum of one cycle of CO and oxygen (or CO2) CEMS operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Collect CO and oxygen (or CO2) data concurrently. Collect at least four CO and oxygen (or CO2) CEMS data values representing the four 15-minute periods in an hour, or at least two 15-minute data values during an hour when CEMS calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities are being performed.
                (4) Reduce the CO CEMS data as specified in § 63.8(g)(2).

                (5) Calculate one-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 3 percent oxygen (or corrected to an CO2 percentage determined to be equivalent to 3 percent oxygen) from each hour of CO CEMS data in parts per million CO concentration. The one-hour arithmetic averages required shall be used to calculate the 30-day or 10-day rolling average emissions. Use Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 for calculating the average CO concentration from the hourly values.
                (6) For purposes of collecting CO data, operate the CO CEMS as specified in § 63.7535(b). You must use all the data collected during all periods in calculating data averages and assessing compliance, except that you must exclude certain data as specified in § 63.7535(c). Periods when CO data are unavailable may constitute monitoring deviations as specified in § 63.7535(d).

                (7) Operate an oxygen trim system with the oxygen level set no lower than the lowest hourly average oxygen concentration measured during the most recent CO performance test as the operating limit for oxygen according to Table 7 to this subpart.
                

                (b) If your boiler or process heater is in the unit designed to burn coal/solid fossil fuel subcategory or the unit designed to burn heavy liquid subcategory and has an average annual heat input rate greater than 250 MMBtu per hour from solid fossil fuel and/or heavy liquid, and you demonstrate compliance with the PM limit instead of the alternative TSM limit, you must install, maintain, and operate a PM CPMS monitoring emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. As an alternative to use of a PM CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the PM limit, you may choose to use a PM CEMS. If you choose to use a PM CEMS to demonstrate compliance with the PM limit instead of the alternative TSM limit, you must install, certify, maintain, and operate a PM CEMS monitoring emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system as specified in paragraph (b)(5) through (8) of this section. For other boilers or process heaters, you may elect to use a PM CPMS or PM CEMS operated in accordance with this section in lieu of using other CMS for monitoring PM compliance (e.g., bag leak detectors, ESP secondary power, and PM scrubber pressure). Owners of boilers and process heaters who elect to comply with the alternative TSM limit are not required to install a PM CPMS.
                (1) Install, operate, and maintain your PM CPMS according to the procedures in your approved site-specific monitoring plan developed in accordance with § 63.7505(d), the requirements in § 63.7540(a)(9), and paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) The operating principle of the PM CPMS must be based on in-stack or extractive light scatter, light scintillation, beta attenuation, or mass accumulation detection of PM in the exhaust gas or representative exhaust gas sample. The reportable measurement output from the PM CPMS must be expressed as milliamps.
                (ii) The PM CPMS must have a cycle time (i.e., period required to complete sampling, measurement, and reporting for each measurement) no longer than 60 minutes.
                (iii) The PM CPMS must have a documented detection limit of 0.5 milligram per actual cubic meter, or less.
                (2) For a new unit, complete the initial performance evaluation no later than July 30, 2013, or 180 days after the date of initial startup, whichever is later. For an existing unit, complete the initial performance evaluation no later than July 29, 2016.

Periods when SO2 data are unavailable may constitute monitoring deviations as specified in § 63.7535(d).
                (5) Collect CEMS hourly averages for all operating hours on a 30-day rolling average basis.
                (6) Use only unadjusted, quality-assured SO2 concentration values in the emissions calculations; do not apply bias adjustment factors to the part 75 SO2 data and do not use part 75 substitute data values.

You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.
                (1) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps.
                (2) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to at least two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit.
                (3) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (e.g., average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour Method 5I test runs).

                (B) If the average of your three PM performance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or performance test with the procedures in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B)(1) through (4) of this section.
                (1) Determine your instrument zero output with one of the following procedures:
                (i) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.
                (ii) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.
                (iii) The zero point may also be established by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept.
                (iv) If none of the steps in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(B)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.
                (2) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 10.

                  X1 = the three run average milliamp output from you PM CPMS, and
                  z = the milliamp equivalent of your instrument zero determined from (B)(i).
                
                
                (4) Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating limit using the lb/MMBtu per milliamp value from Equation 11 in equation 12, below. This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of your emission limit.

                  L = your source emission limit expressed in lb/MMBtu,
                  z = your instrument zero in milliamps, determined from (B)(i), and
                  R = the relative lb/MMBtu per milliamp for your PM CPMS, from Equation 11.
                
                
                (C) If the average of your three PM compliance test runs is at or above 75 percent of your PM emission limit you must determine your 30-day rolling average operating limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp output corresponding to your three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using equation 13 and you must submit all compliance test and PM CPMS data according to the reporting requirements in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this section.

                (D) To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (milliamps) on a 30-day rolling average basis, updated at the end of each new operating hour. Use Equation 14 to determine the 30-day rolling average.

                (E) Use EPA Method 5 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to determine PM emissions. For each performance test, conduct three separate runs under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably expected to occur. Conduct each test run to collect a minimum sample volume specified in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, as applicable, for determining compliance with a new source limit or an existing source limit. Calculate the average of the results from three runs to determine compliance. You need not determine the PM collected in the impingers (“back half”) of the Method 5 particulate sampling train to demonstrate compliance with the PM standards of this subpart. This shall not preclude the permitting authority from requiring a determination of the “back half” for other purposes.

                (F) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (e.g. beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.
                (iii) For a particulate wet scrubber, you must establish the minimum pressure drop and liquid flow rate as defined in § 63.7575, as your operating limits during the three-run performance test during which you demonstrate compliance with your applicable limit. If you use a wet scrubber and you conduct separate performance tests for PM and TSM emissions, you must establish one set of minimum scrubber liquid flow rate and pressure drop operating limits. The minimum scrubber effluent pH operating limit must be established during the HCl performance test. If you conduct multiple performance tests, you must set the minimum liquid flow rate and pressure drop operating limits at the higher of the minimum values established during the performance tests.
                (iv) For an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) operated with a wet scrubber, you must establish the minimum total secondary electric power input, as defined in § 63.7575, as your operating limit during the three-run performance test during which you demonstrate compliance with your applicable limit. (These operating limits do not apply to ESP that are operated as dry controls without a wet scrubber.)
                (v) For a dry scrubber, you must establish the minimum sorbent injection rate for each sorbent, as defined in § 63.7575, as your operating limit during the three-run performance test during which you demonstrate compliance with your applicable limit.
                (vi) For activated carbon injection, you must establish the minimum activated carbon injection rate, as defined in § 63.7575, as your operating limit during the three-run performance test during which you demonstrate compliance with your applicable limit.

                (vii) The operating limit for boilers or process heaters with fabric filters that demonstrate continuous compliance through bag leak detection systems is that a bag leak detection system be installed according to the requirements in § 63.7525, and that each fabric filter must be operated such that the bag leak detection system alert is not activated more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period.
                (viii) For a minimum oxygen level, if you conduct multiple performance tests, you must set the minimum oxygen level at the lower of the minimum values established during the performance tests.

                (ix) The operating limit for boilers or process heaters that demonstrate continuous compliance with the HCl emission limit using a SO2 CEMS is to install and operate the SO2 according to the requirements in § 63.7525(m) establish a maximum SO2 emission rate equal to the highest hourly average SO2 measurement during the most recent three-run performance test for HCl.
                (c) If you elect to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit through fuel analysis, you must conduct fuel analyses according to § 63.7521 and follow the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section.
                (1) If you burn more than one fuel type, you must determine the fuel mixture you could burn in your boiler or process heater that would result in the maximum emission rates of the pollutants that you elect to demonstrate compliance through fuel analysis.
                (2) You must determine the 90th percentile confidence level fuel pollutant concentration of the composite samples analyzed for each fuel type using the one-sided t-statistic test described in Equation 15 of this section.

                § 63.7533
                Can I use efficiency credits earned from implementation of energy conservation measures to comply with this subpart?

                (a) If you elect to comply with the alternative equivalent output-based emission limits, instead of the heat input-based limits listed in Table 2 to this subpart, and you want to take credit for implementing energy conservation measures identified in an energy assessment, you may demonstrate compliance using efficiency credits according to the procedures in this section. You may use this compliance approach for an existing affected boiler for demonstrating initial compliance according to § 63.7522(e) and for demonstrating monthly compliance according to § 63.7522(f). Owners or operators using this compliance approach must establish an emissions benchmark, calculate and document the efficiency credits, develop an Implementation Plan, comply with the general reporting requirements, and apply the efficiency credit according to the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. You cannot use this compliance approach for a new or reconstructed affected boiler. Additional guidance from the Department of Energy on efficiency credits is available at: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/boiler/boilerpg.html.
                

                (b) For each existing affected boiler for which you intend to apply emissions credits, establish a benchmark from which emission reduction credits may be generated by determining the actual annual fuel heat input to the affected boiler before initiation of an energy conservation activity to reduce energy demand (i.e., fuel usage) according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. The benchmark shall be expressed in trillion Btu per year heat input.
                (1) The benchmark from which efficiency credits may be generated shall be determined by using the most representative, accurate, and reliable process available for the source. The benchmark shall be established for a one-year period before the date that an energy demand reduction occurs, unless it can be demonstrated that a different time period is more representative of historical operations.
                (2) Determine the starting point from which to measure progress. Inventory all fuel purchased and generated on-site (off-gases, residues) in physical units (MMBtu, million cubic feet, etc.).
                (3) Document all uses of energy from the affected boiler. Use the most recent data available.
                (4) Collect non-energy related facility and operational data to normalize, if necessary, the benchmark to current operations, such as building size, operating hours, etc. If possible, use actual data that are current and timely rather than estimated data.

                (c) Efficiency credits can be generated if the energy conservation measures were implemented after January 1, 2008 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits.
                
                (1) The following emission points cannot be used to generate efficiency credits:
                (i) Energy conservation measures implemented on or before January 1, 2008, unless the level of energy demand reduction is increased after January 1, 2008, in which case credit will be allowed only for change in demand reduction achieved after January 1, 2008.
                (ii) Efficiency credits on shut-down boilers. Boilers that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits unless the facility provides documentation linking the permanent shutdown to energy conservation measures identified in the energy assessment. In this case, the bench established for the affected boiler to which the credits from the shutdown will be applied must be revised to include the benchmark established for the shutdown boiler.
                (2) For all points included in calculating emissions credits, the owner or operator shall:
                (i) Calculate annual credits for all energy demand points. Use Equation 19 to calculate credits. Energy conservation measures that meet the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not be included, except as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
                (3) Credits are generated by the difference between the benchmark that is established for each affected boiler, and the actual energy demand reductions from energy conservation measures implemented after January 1, 2008. Credits shall be calculated using Equation 19 of this section as follows:
                (i) The overall equation for calculating credits is:
                
                  ER31JA13.023

                  ECredits = Energy Input Savings for all energy conservation measures implemented for an affected boiler, expressed as a decimal fraction of the baseline energy input.
                  EISiactual = Energy Input Savings for each energy conservation measure, i, implemented for an affected boiler, million Btu per year.
                  EIbaseline = Energy Input baseline for the affected boiler, million Btu per year.
                  n = Number of energy conservation measures included in the efficiency credit for the affected boiler.
                
                
                (ii) [Reserved]
                (d) The owner or operator shall develop, and submit for approval upon request by the Administrator, an Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in this paragraph for all boilers to be included in an efficiency credit approach. The Implementation Plan shall identify all existing affected boilers to be included in applying the efficiency credits. The Implementation Plan shall include a description of the energy conservation measures implemented and the energy savings generated from each measure and an explanation of the criteria used for determining that savings. If requested, you must submit the implementation plan for efficiency credits to the Administrator for review and approval no later than 180 days before the date on which the facility intends to demonstrate compliance using the efficiency credit approach.
                (e) The emissions rate as calculated using Equation 20 of this section from each existing boiler participating in the efficiency credit option must be in compliance with the limits in Table 2 to this subpart at all times the affected unit is subject to numeric emission limits, following the compliance date specified in § 63.7495.
                (f) You must use Equation 20 of this section to demonstrate initial compliance by demonstrating that the emissions from the affected boiler participating in the efficiency credit compliance approach do not exceed the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart.

              Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 63.7535
                Is there a minimum amount of monitoring data I must obtain?
                (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section and the site-specific monitoring plan required by § 63.7505(d).
                (b) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times that each boiler or process heater is operating and compliance is required, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out of control periods (see § 63.8(c)(7) of this part), and required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities, including, as applicable, calibration checks, required zero and span adjustments, and scheduled CMS maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
                (c) You may not use data recorded during periods of startup and shutdown, monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in data averages and calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must record and make available upon request results of CMS performance audits and dates and duration of periods when the CMS is out of control to completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the CMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance and the operation of the control device and associated control system.
                (d) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits, calibration checks, and required zero and span adjustments), failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements. In calculating monitoring results, do not use any data collected during periods of startup and shutdown, when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, while conducting repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or while conducting required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities. You must calculate monitoring results using all other monitoring data collected while the process is operating. You must report all periods when the monitoring system is out of control in your semi-annual report.
                [76 FR 15664, Mar. 21, 2011, as amended at 78 FR 7179, Jan. 31, 2013; 80 FR 72812, Nov. 20, 2015]
              
              
                
                § 63.7540
                How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations, fuel specifications and work practice standards?
                (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limit in Tables 1 and 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart, the work practice standards in Table 3 to this subpart, and the operating limits in Table 4 to this subpart that applies to you according to the methods specified in Table 8 to this subpart and paragraphs (a)(1) through (19) of this section.
                (1) Following the date on which the initial compliance demonstration is completed or is required to be completed under §§ 63.7 and 63.7510, whichever date comes first, operation above the established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits shall constitute a deviation of established operating limits listed in Table 4 of this subpart except during performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission limits or to establish new operating limits. Operating limits must be confirmed or reestablished during performance tests.
                (2) As specified in § 63.7555(d), you must keep records of the type and amount of all fuels burned in each boiler or process heater during the reporting period to demonstrate that all fuel types and mixtures of fuels burned would result in either of the following:
                (i) Equal to or lower emissions of HCl, mercury, and TSM than the applicable emission limit for each pollutant, if you demonstrate compliance through fuel analysis.
                (ii) Equal to or lower fuel input of chlorine, mercury, and TSM than the maximum values calculated during the last performance test, if you demonstrate compliance through performance testing.
                (3) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable HCl emission limit through fuel analysis for a solid or liquid fuel and you plan to burn a new type of solid or liquid fuel, you must recalculate the HCl emission rate using Equation 16 of § 63.7530 according to paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section. You are not required to conduct fuel analyses for the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii). You may exclude the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii) when recalculating the HCl emission rate.
                (i) You must determine the chlorine concentration for any new fuel type in units of pounds per million Btu, based on supplier data or your own fuel analysis, according to the provisions in your site-specific fuel analysis plan developed according to § 63.7521(b).
                (ii) You must determine the new mixture of fuels that will have the highest content of chlorine.
                (iii) Recalculate the HCl emission rate from your boiler or process heater under these new conditions using Equation 16 of § 63.7530. The recalculated HCl emission rate must be less than the applicable emission limit.
                (4) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable HCl emission limit through performance testing and you plan to burn a new type of fuel or a new mixture of fuels, you must recalculate the maximum chlorine input using Equation 7 of § 63.7530. If the results of recalculating the maximum chlorine input using Equation 7 of § 63.7530 are greater than the maximum chlorine input level established during the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel mixture according to the procedures in § 63.7520 to demonstrate that the HCl emissions do not exceed the emission limit. You must also establish new operating limits based on this performance test according to the procedures in § 63.7530(b). In recalculating the maximum chlorine input and establishing the new operating limits, you are not required to conduct fuel analyses for and include the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii).

                (5) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable mercury emission limit through fuel analysis, and you plan to burn a new type of fuel, you must recalculate the mercury emission rate using Equation 17 of § 63.7530 according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section. You are not required to conduct fuel analyses for the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii). You may exclude the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii) when recalculating the mercury emission rate.
                
                (i) You must determine the mercury concentration for any new fuel type in units of pounds per million Btu, based on supplier data or your own fuel analysis, according to the provisions in your site-specific fuel analysis plan developed according to § 63.7521(b).
                (ii) You must determine the new mixture of fuels that will have the highest content of mercury.
                (iii) Recalculate the mercury emission rate from your boiler or process heater under these new conditions using Equation 17 of § 63.7530. The recalculated mercury emission rate must be less than the applicable emission limit.
                (6) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable mercury emission limit through performance testing, and you plan to burn a new type of fuel or a new mixture of fuels, you must recalculate the maximum mercury input using Equation 8 of § 63.7530. If the results of recalculating the maximum mercury input using Equation 8 of § 63.7530 are higher than the maximum mercury input level established during the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel mixture according to the procedures in § 63.7520 to demonstrate that the mercury emissions do not exceed the emission limit. You must also establish new operating limits based on this performance test according to the procedures in § 63.7530(b). You are not required to conduct fuel analyses for the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii). You may exclude the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii) when recalculating the mercury emission rate.
                (7) If your unit is controlled with a fabric filter, and you demonstrate continuous compliance using a bag leak detection system, you must initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection system alert and complete corrective actions as soon as practical, and operate and maintain the fabric filter system such that the periods which would cause an alert are no more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. You must also keep records of the date, time, and duration of each alert, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alert and the corrective action taken. You must also record the percent of the operating time during each 6-month period that the conditions exist for an alert. In calculating this operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alert time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alert shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alert time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.
                (8) To demonstrate compliance with the applicable alternative CO CEMS emission limit listed in Tables 1, 2, or 11 through 13 to this subpart, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) through (iv) of this section.
                (i) Continuously monitor CO according to §§ 63.7525(a) and 63.7535.
                (ii) Maintain a CO emission level below or at your applicable alternative CO CEMS-based standard in Tables 1 or 2 or 11 through 13 to this subpart at all times the affected unit is subject to numeric emission limits.
                (iii) Keep records of CO levels according to § 63.7555(b).
                (iv) You must record and make available upon request results of CO CEMS performance audits, dates and duration of periods when the CO CEMS is out of control to completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the CO CEMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (9) The owner or operator of a boiler or process heater using a PM CPMS or a PM CEMS to meet requirements of this subpart shall install, certify, operate, and maintain the PM CPMS or PM CEMS in accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan as required in § 63.7505(d).

                (10) If your boiler or process heater has a heat input capacity of 10 million Btu per hour or greater, you must conduct an annual tune-up of the boiler or process heater to demonstrate continuous compliance as specified in paragraphs (a)(10)(i) through (vi) of this section. You must conduct the tune-up while burning the type of fuel (or fuels in case of units that routinely burn a mixture) that provided the majority of the heat input to the boiler or process heater over the 12 months prior to the tune-up. This frequency does not apply to limited-use boilers and process heaters, as defined in § 63.7575, or units with continuous oxygen trim systems that maintain an optimum air to fuel ratio.
                (i) As applicable, inspect the burner, and clean or replace any components of the burner as necessary (you may perform the burner inspection any time prior to the tune-up or delay the burner inspection until the next scheduled unit shutdown). Units that produce electricity for sale may delay the burner inspection until the first outage, not to exceed 36 months from the previous inspection. At units where entry into a piece of process equipment or into a storage vessel is required to complete the tune-up inspections, inspections are required only during planned entries into the storage vessel or process equipment;
                (ii) Inspect the flame pattern, as applicable, and adjust the burner as necessary to optimize the flame pattern. The adjustment should be consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, if available;
                (iii) Inspect the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio, as applicable, and ensure that it is correctly calibrated and functioning properly (you may delay the inspection until the next scheduled unit shutdown). Units that produce electricity for sale may delay the inspection until the first outage, not to exceed 36 months from the previous inspection;

                (iv) Optimize total emissions of CO. This optimization should be consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, if available, and with any NOX requirement to which the unit is subject;
                (v) Measure the concentrations in the effluent stream of CO in parts per million, by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, before and after the adjustments are made (measurements may be either on a dry or wet basis, as long as it is the same basis before and after the adjustments are made). Measurements may be taken using a portable CO analyzer; and
                (vi) Maintain on-site and submit, if requested by the Administrator, a report containing the information in paragraphs (a)(10)(vi)(A) through (C) of this section,
                (A) The concentrations of CO in the effluent stream in parts per million by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, measured at high fire or typical operating load, before and after the tune-up of the boiler or process heater;
                (B) A description of any corrective actions taken as a part of the tune-up; and
                (C) The type and amount of fuel used over the 12 months prior to the tune-up, but only if the unit was physically and legally capable of using more than one type of fuel during that period. Units sharing a fuel meter may estimate the fuel used by each unit.
                (11) If your boiler or process heater has a heat input capacity of less than 10 million Btu per hour (except as specified in paragraph (a)(12) of this section), you must conduct a biennial tune-up of the boiler or process heater as specified in paragraphs (a)(10)(i) through (vi) of this section to demonstrate continuous compliance.
                (12) If your boiler or process heater has a continuous oxygen trim system that maintains an optimum air to fuel ratio, or a heat input capacity of less than or equal to 5 million Btu per hour and the unit is in the units designed to burn gas 1; units designed to burn gas 2 (other); or units designed to burn light liquid subcategories, or meets the definition of limited-use boiler or process heater in § 63.7575, you must conduct a tune-up of the boiler or process heater every 5 years as specified in paragraphs (a)(10)(i) through (vi) of this section to demonstrate continuous compliance. You may delay the burner inspection specified in paragraph (a)(10)(i) of this section until the next scheduled or unscheduled unit shutdown, but you must inspect each burner at least once every 72 months. If an oxygen trim system is utilized on a unit without emission standards to reduce the tune-up frequency to once every 5 years, set the oxygen level no lower than the oxygen concentration measured during the most recent tune-up.

                (13) If the unit is not operating on the required date for a tune-up, the tune-up must be conducted within 30 calendar days of startup.
                
                (14) If you are using a CEMS measuring mercury emissions to meet requirements of this subpart you must install, certify, operate, and maintain the mercury CEMS as specified in paragraphs (a)(14)(i) and (ii) of this section.
                (i) Operate the mercury CEMS in accordance with performance specification 12A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B or operate a sorbent trap based integrated monitor in accordance with performance specification 12B of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. The duration of the performance test must be 30 operating days if you specified a 30 operating day basis in § 63.7545(e)(2)(iii) for mercury CEMS or it must be 720 hours if you specified a 720 hour basis in § 63.7545(e)(2)(iii) for mercury CEMS. For each day in which the unit operates, you must obtain hourly mercury concentration data, and stack gas volumetric flow rate data.
                (ii) If you are using a mercury CEMS, you must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the mercury mass emissions rate to the atmosphere according to the requirements of performance specifications 6 and 12A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and quality assurance procedure 6 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.

                (15) If you are using a CEMS to measure HCl emissions to meet requirements of this subpart, you must install, certify, operate, and maintain the HCl CEMS as specified in paragraphs (a)(15)(i) and (ii) of this section. This option for an affected unit takes effect on the date a final performance specification for an HCl CEMS is published in the Federal Register or the date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan.
                (i) Operate the continuous emissions monitoring system in accordance with the applicable performance specification in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. The duration of the performance test must be 30 operating days if you specified a 30 operating day basis in § 63.7545(e)(2)(iii) for HCl CEMS or it must be 720 hours if you specified a 720 hour basis in § 63.7545(e)(2)(iii) for HCl CEMS. For each day in which the unit operates, you must obtain hourly HCl concentration data, and stack gas volumetric flow rate data.
                (ii) If you are using a HCl CEMS, you must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the HCl mass emissions rate to the atmosphere according to the requirements of the applicable performance specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and the quality assurance procedures of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.
                (16) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable TSM emission limit through performance testing, and you plan to burn a new type of fuel or a new mixture of fuels, you must recalculate the maximum TSM input using Equation 9 of § 63.7530. If the results of recalculating the maximum TSM input using Equation 9 of § 63.7530 are higher than the maximum total selected input level established during the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel mixture according to the procedures in § 63.7520 to demonstrate that the TSM emissions do not exceed the emission limit. You must also establish new operating limits based on this performance test according to the procedures in § 63.7530(b). You are not required to conduct fuel analyses for the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii). You may exclude the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii) when recalculating the TSM emission rate.
                (17) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable TSM emission limit through fuel analysis for solid or liquid fuels, and you plan to burn a new type of fuel, you must recalculate the TSM emission rate using Equation 18 of § 63.7530 according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section. You are not required to conduct fuel analyses for the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii). You may exclude the fuels described in § 63.7510(a)(2)(i) through (iii) when recalculating the TSM emission rate.

                (i) You must determine the TSM concentration for any new fuel type in units of pounds per million Btu, based on supplier data or your own fuel analysis, according to the provisions in your site-specific fuel analysis plan developed according to § 63.7521(b).
                
                (ii) You must determine the new mixture of fuels that will have the highest content of TSM.
                (iii) Recalculate the TSM emission rate from your boiler or process heater under these new conditions using Equation 18 of § 63.7530. The recalculated TSM emission rate must be less than the applicable emission limit.
                (18) If you demonstrate continuous PM emissions compliance with a PM CPMS you will use a PM CPMS to establish a site-specific operating limit corresponding to the results of the performance test demonstrating compliance with the PM limit. You will conduct your performance test using the test method criteria in Table 5 of this subpart. You will use the PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous compliance with this operating limit. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.
                (i) To determine continuous compliance, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (milliamps) on a 30-day rolling average basis.
                (ii) For any deviation of the 30-day rolling PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit, you must:
                (A) Within 48 hours of the deviation, visually inspect the air pollution control device (APCD);
                (B) If inspection of the APCD identifies the cause of the deviation, take corrective action as soon as possible and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value; and
                (C) Within 30 days of the deviation or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit and to verify or re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct additional testing for any deviations that occur between the time of the original deviation and the PM emissions compliance test required under this paragraph.
                (iii) PM CPMS deviations from the operating limit leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month operating period constitute a separate violation of this subpart.
                (19) If you choose to comply with the PM filterable emissions limit by using PM CEMS you must install, certify, operate, and maintain a PM CEMS and record the output of the PM CEMS as specified in paragraphs (a)(19)(i) through (vii) of this section. The compliance limit will be expressed as a 30-day rolling average of the numerical emissions limit value applicable for your unit in Tables 1 or 2 or 11 through 13 of this subpart.
                (i) Install and certify your PM CEMS according to the procedures and requirements in Performance Specification 11—Specifications and Test Procedures for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources in Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, using test criteria outlined in Table V of this rule. The reportable measurement output from the PM CEMS must be expressed in units of the applicable emissions limit (e.g., lb/MMBtu, lb/MWh).
                (ii) Operate and maintain your PM CEMS according to the procedures and requirements in Procedure 2— Quality Assurance Requirements for Particulate Matter Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems at Stationary Sources in Appendix F to part 60 of this chapter.

                (iv) Calculate the arithmetic 30-day rolling average of all of the hourly average PM CEMS output data collected during all nonexempt boiler or process heater operating hours.

                (v) You must collect data using the PM CEMS at all times the unit is operating and at the intervals specified this paragraph (a), except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities.
                (vi) You must use all the data collected during all boiler or process heater operating hours in assessing the compliance with your operating limit except:
                (A) Any data collected during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities conducted during monitoring system malfunctions in calculations and report any such periods in your annual deviation report;
                (B) Any data collected during periods when the monitoring system is out of control as specified in your site-specific monitoring plan, repairs associated with periods when the monitoring system is out of control, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities conducted during out of control periods in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels and report any such periods in your annual deviation report;
                (C) Any data recorded during periods of startup or shutdown.
                (vii) You must record and make available upon request results of PM CEMS system performance audits, dates and duration of periods when the PM CEMS is out of control to completion of the corrective actions necessary to return the PM CEMS to operation consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan.
                (b) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each emission limit and operating limit in Tables 1 through 4 or 11 through 13 to this subpart that apply to you. These instances are deviations from the emission limits or operating limits, respectively, in this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.7550.
                (c) If you elected to demonstrate that the unit meets the specification for mercury for the unit designed to burn gas 1 subcategory, you must follow the sampling frequency specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section and conduct this sampling according to the procedures in § 63.7521(f) through (i).
                (1) If the initial mercury constituents in the gaseous fuels are measured to be equal to or less than half of the mercury specification as defined in § 63.7575, you do not need to conduct further sampling.
                (2) If the initial mercury constituents are greater than half but equal to or less than 75 percent of the mercury specification as defined in § 63.7575, you will conduct semi-annual sampling. If 6 consecutive semi-annual fuel analyses demonstrate 50 percent or less of the mercury specification, you do not need to conduct further sampling. If any semi-annual sample exceeds 75 percent of the mercury specification, you must return to monthly sampling for that fuel, until 12 months of fuel analyses again are less than 75 percent of the compliance level.
                (3) If the initial mercury constituents are greater than 75 percent of the mercury specification as defined in § 63.7575, you will conduct monthly sampling. If 12 consecutive monthly fuel analyses demonstrate 75 percent or less of the mercury specification, you may decrease the fuel analysis frequency to semi-annual for that fuel.
                (4) If the initial sample exceeds the mercury specification as defined in § 63.7575, each affected boiler or process heater combusting this fuel is not part of the unit designed to burn gas 1 subcategory and must be in compliance with the emission and operating limits for the appropriate subcategory. You may elect to conduct additional monthly sampling while complying with these emissions and operating limits to demonstrate that the fuel qualifies as another gas 1 fuel. If 12 consecutive monthly fuel analyses samples are at or below the mercury specification as defined in § 63.7575, each affected boiler or process heater combusting the fuel can elect to switch back into the unit designed to burn gas 1 subcategory until the mercury specification is exceeded.

                (d) For startup and shutdown, you must meet the work practice standards according to items 5 and 6 of Table 3 of this subpart.

Hot water boilers (i.e., not generating steam) combusting gaseous, liquid, or biomass fuel with a heat input capacity of less than 1.6 million Btu per hour are included in this definition. The 120 U.S. gallon capacity threshold to be considered a hot water heater is independent of the 1.6 MMBtu/hr heat input capacity threshold for hot water boilers. Hot water heater also means a tankless unit that provides on demand hot water.

Process heaters are devices in which the combustion gases do not come into direct contact with process materials. A device combusting solid waste, as defined in § 241.3 of this chapter, is not a process heater unless the device is exempt from the definition of a solid waste incineration unit as provided in section 129(g)(1) of the Clean Air Act. Process heaters do not include units used for comfort heat or space heat, food preparation for on-site consumption, or autoclaves. Waste heat process heaters are excluded from this definition.

                  c An owner or operator may request an alternative test method under § 63.7 of this chapter, in order that compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limit be determined using carbon dioxide as a diluent correction in place of oxygen at 3%. EPA Method 19 F-factors and EPA Method 19 equations must be used to generate the appropriate CO2 correction percentage for the fuel type burned in the unit, and must also take into account that the 3% oxygen correction is to be done on a dry basis. The alternative test method request must account for any CO2 being added to, or removed from, the emissions gas stream as a result of limestone injection, scrubber media, etc.

                This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for iron and steel foundries. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emissions limitations, work practice standards, and operation and maintenance requirements in this subpart.
              
              
                
                § 63.7681
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an iron and steel foundry that is (or is part of) a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions. Your iron and steel foundry is a major source of HAP for purposes of this subpart if it emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons or more per year or if it is located at a facility that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons or more per year as defined in § 63.2.

                (a) As required by § 63.6(e)(1)(i), you must always operate and maintain your iron and steel foundry, including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels required by this subpart.
                (b) You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written operation and maintenance plan for each capture and collection system and control device for an emissions source subject to a PM, metal HAP, TEA, or VOHAP emissions limit in § 63.7690(a). Your operation and maintenance plan also must include procedures for igniting gases from mold vents in pouring areas and pouring stations that use a sand mold system. This operation and maintenance plan is subject to approval by the Administrator. Each plan must contain the elements described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.

                (1) Monthly inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches). This inspection must include observations of the physical appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in the ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in the ductwork, and fan erosion). The operation and maintenance plan must also include requirements to repair the defect or deficiency as soon as practicable.
                (2) Operating limits for each capture system for an emissions source subject to an emissions limit or standard for VOHAP or TEA in § 63.7690(a)(8) through (11). You must establish the operating according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) Select operating limit parameters appropriate for the capture system design that are representative and reliable indicators of the performance of the capture system. At a minimum, you must use appropriate operating limit parameters that indicate the level of the ventilation draft and damper position settings for the capture system when operating to collect emissions, including revised settings for seasonal variations. Appropriate operating limit parameters for ventilation draft include, but are not limited to: volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood, total volumetric flow rate at the inlet to the control device to which the capture system is vented, fan motor amperage, or static pressure. Any parameter for damper position setting may be used that indicates the duct damper position related to the fully open setting.

                (ii) For each operating limit parameter selected in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, designate the value or setting for the parameter at which the capture system operates during the process operation. If your operation allows for more than one process to be operating simultaneously, designate the value or setting for the parameter at which the capture system operates during each possible configuration that you may operate (i.e., the operating limits with one furnace melting, two melting, as applicable to your plant).
                (iii) Include documentation in your plan to support your selection of the operating limits established for your capture system. This documentation must include a description of the capture system design, a description of the capture system operating during production, a description of each selected operating limit parameter, a rationale for why you chose the parameter, a description of the method used to monitor the parameter according to the requirements of § 63.7740(a), and the data used to set the value or setting for the parameter for each of your process configurations.
                (3) Preventative maintenance plan for each control device, including a preventative maintenance schedule that is consistent with the manufacturer's instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.
                (4) A site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. For each bag leak detection system that operates on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan must be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance” (EPA-454/R-98-015). This baghouse monitoring plan is subject to approval by the Administrator. The owner or operator shall operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. The plan must address all of the items identified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
                (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system.
                (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system including how the alarm set-point will be established.
                (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality assurance procedures.
                (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.
                (v) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and stored.
                (5) Corrective action plan for each baghouse. The plan must include the requirement that, in the event a bag leak detection system alarm is triggered, you must initiate corrective action to determine the cause of the alarm within 1 hour of the alarm, initiate corrective action to correct the cause of the problem within 24 hours of the alarm, and complete the corrective action as soon as practicable. Corrective actions taken may include, but are not limited to:
                (i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in emissions.
                (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
                (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.
                (iv) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment.
                (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise repairing the bag leak detection system.
                (vi) Making process changes.
                (vii) Shutting down the process producing the PM emissions.
                (6) Procedures for providing an ignition source to mold vents of sand mold systems in each pouring area and pouring station unless you determine the mold vent gases either are not ignitable, ignite automatically, or cannot be ignited due to accessibility or safety issues. You must document and maintain records of this determination. The determination of ignitability, accessibility, and safety may encompass multiple casting patterns provided the castings utilize similar sand-to-metal ratios, binder formulations, and coating materials. The determination of ignitability must be based on observations of the mold vents within 5 minutes of pouring, and the flame must be present for at least 15 seconds for the mold vent to be considered ignited. For the purpose of this determination:
                (i) Mold vents that ignite more than 75 percent of the time without the presence of an auxiliary ignition source are considered to ignite automatically; and

                (ii) Mold vents that do not ignite automatically and cannot be ignited in the presence of an auxiliary ignition source more than 25 percent of the time are considered to be not ignitable.

                  Responsible official means responsible official as defined in § 63.2.
                
                  Scrap preheater means a vessel or other piece of equipment in which metal scrap that is to be used as melting furnace feed is heated to a temperature high enough to eliminate volatile impurities or other tramp materials by direct flame heating or similar means of heating. Scrap dryers, which solely remove moisture from metal scrap, are not considered to be scrap preheaters for purposes of this subpart.
                
                  Scrubber blowdown means liquor or slurry discharged from a wet scrubber that is either removed as a waste stream or processed to remove impurities or adjust its composition or pH before being returned to the scrubber.
                
                  Total metal HAP means, for the purposes of this subpart, the sum of the concentrations of antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium as measured by EPA Method 29 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A). Only the measured concentration of the listed analytes that are present at concentrations exceeding one-half the quantitation limit of the analytical method are to be used in the sum. If any of the analytes are not detected or are detected at concentrations less than one-half the quantitation limit of the analytical method, the concentration of those analytes will be assumed to be zero for the purposes of calculating the total metal HAP for this subpart.
                
                  Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated pursuant to section 112(h) of the CAA.

              Operation and Maintenance Requirements
              
                § 63.7800
                What are my operation and maintenance requirements?
                (a) As required by § 63.6(e)(1)(i), you must always operate and maintain your affected source, including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels required by this subpart.
                (b) You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written operation and maintenance plan for each capture system or control device subject to an operating limit in § 63.7790(b). Each plan must address the elements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section.

                (1) Monthly inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the total capture system (e.g., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches). This inspection must include observations of the physical appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in the ductwork, and fan erosion). The operation and maintenance plan also must include requirements to repair any defect or deficiency in the capture system before the next scheduled inspection.

                (2) Preventative maintenance for each control device, including a preventative maintenance schedule that is consistent with the manufacturer's instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.
                
                (3) Operating limits for each capture system applied to emissions from a sinter plant discharge end or blast furnace casthouse, or to secondary emissions from a BOPF. You must establish the operating limits according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) Select operating limit parameters appropriate for the capture system design that are representative and reliable indicators of the performance of the capture system. At a minimum, you must use appropriate operating limit parameters that indicate the level of the ventilation draft and the damper position settings for the capture system when operating to collect emissions, including revised settings for seasonal variations. Appropriate operating limit parameters for ventilation draft include, but are not limited to, volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood, total volumetric flow rate at the inlet to the control device to which the capture system is vented, fan motor amperage, or static pressure.
                (ii) For each operating limit parameter selected in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, designate the value or setting for the parameter at which the capture system operates during the process operation. If your operation allows for more than one process to be operating simultaneously, designate the value or setting for the parameter at which the capture system operates during each possible configuration that you may operate.
                (iii) Include documentation in your plan to support your selection of the operating limits established for the capture system. This documentation must include a description of the capture system design, a description of the capture system operating during production, a description of each selected operating limit parameter, a rationale for why you chose the parameter, a description of the method used to monitor the parameter according to the requirements of § 63.7830(a), and the data used to set the value or setting for the parameter for each of your process configurations.
                (4) Corrective action procedures for baghouses equipped with bag leak detection systems or continuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS). In the event a bag leak detection system alarm is triggered or emissions from a baghouse equipped with a COMS exceed an hourly average opacity of 5 percent, you must initiate corrective action to determine the cause of the alarm within 1 hour of the alarm, initiate corrective action to correct the cause of the problem within 24 hours of the alarm, and complete the corrective action as soon as practicable. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to:
                (i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in emissions.
                (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
                (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.
                (iv) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment.
                (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe, or otherwise repair the bag leak detection system.
                (vi) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.
                (5) Corrective action procedures for venturi scrubbers equipped with continuous parameter monitoring systems (CPMS). In the event a venturi scrubber exceeds the operating limit in § 63.7790(b)(2), you must take corrective actions consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan in accordance with § 63.7831(a).
                (6) Corrective action procedures for electrostatic precipitators equipped with COMS. In the event an electrostatic precipitator exceeds the operating limit in § 63.7790(b)(3), you must take corrective actions consistent with your site-specific monitoring plan in accordance with § 63.7831(a).
                (7) Procedures for determining and recording the daily sinter plant production rate in tons per hour.

              What This Subpart Covers
              
                § 63.7880
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes national emissions limitations and work practice standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from site remediation activities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emissions limitations and work practice standards.
              
              
                § 63.7881
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                (a) This subpart applies to you if you own or operate a facility at which you conduct a site remediation, as defined in § 63.7957; and this site remediation, unless exempted under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, meets all three of the following conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) Your site remediation cleans up a remediation material, as defined in § 63.7957.
                (2) Your site remediation is co-located at your facility with one or more other stationary sources that emit HAP and meet an affected source definition specified for a source category that is regulated by another subpart under 40 CFR part 63. This condition applies regardless whether or not the affected stationary source(s) at your facility is subject to the standards under the applicable subpart(s).
                (3) Your facility is a major source of HAP as defined in § 63.2, except as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section. A major source emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at the rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year.
                (i) For production field facilities, as defined in § 63.761, only the HAP emissions from the glycol dehydration units and storage vessels with the potential for flash emissions (both as defined in § 63.761) shall be aggregated with the HAP emissions from the site remediation activities at the facility for a major source determination.
                (ii) For natural gas transmission and storage facilities, HAP emissions shall be aggregated in accordance with the definition of major source in § 63.1271 for a major source determination.
                (b) You are not subject to this subpart if your site remediation qualifies for any of one of the exemptions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.
                (1) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation only cleans up material that does not contain any of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart.
                (2) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation will be performed under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act (CERCLA) as a remedial action or a non time-critical removal action.
                (3) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation will be performed under a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action conducted at a treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF) that is either required by your permit issued by either the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a State program authorized by the EPA under RCRA section 3006; required by orders authorized under RCRA; or required by orders authorized under RCRA section 7003.
                (4) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation is conducted at a gasoline service station to clean up remediation material from a leaking underground storage tank.
                (5) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation is conducted at a farm or residential site.

                (6) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site remediation is conducted at a research and development facility that meets the requirements under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112(c)(7).
                
                (c) Your site remediation activities are not subject to the requirements of this subpart, except for the recordkeeping requirements in this paragraph, provided that you meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section.
                (1) You determine that the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 to this subpart that is contained in the remediation material excavated, extracted, pumped, or otherwise removed during all of the site remediations conducted at your facility is less than 1 megagram (Mg) annually. This exemption applies the 1 Mg limit on a facility-wide, annual basis, and there is no restriction to the number of site remediations that can be conducted during this period.
                (2) You must prepare and maintain at your facility written documentation to support your determination that the total HAP quantity in your remediation materials for the year is less than 1 Mg. The documentation must include a description of your methodology and data used for determining the total HAP content of the remediation material.
                (3) Your Title V permit does not have to be reopened or revised solely to include the recordkeeping requirement specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. However, the requirement must be included in your permit the next time the permit is renewed, reopened, or revised for another reason.
                (d) Your site remediation is not subject to the requirements of this subpart if all remediation activities at your facility subject to this subpart are completed and you have notified the Administrator in writing that all remediation activities subject to this subpart are completed. You must maintain records of compliance, in accordance with § 63.7953, for each remediation activity that was subject to this subpart. All future remediation activity meeting the applicability criteria in this section must comply with the requirements of this subpart.

                § 63.7882
                What site remediation sources at my facility does this subpart affect?
                (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source for your site remediation as designated by paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) Process vents. The affected source is the entire group of process vents associated with the in-situ and ex-situ remediation processes used at your site to remove, destroy, degrade, transform, or immobilize hazardous substances in the remediation material subject to remediation. Examples of such in-situ remediation processes include, but are not limited to, soil vapor extraction and bioremediation processes. Examples of such ex-situ remediation processes include but are not limited to, thermal desorption, bioremediation, and air stripping processes.
                (2) Remediation material management units. Remediation material management unit means a tank, surface impoundment, container, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system, as defined in § 63.7957, and is used at your site to manage remediation material. The affected source is the entire group of remediation material management units used for the site remediations at your site. For the purpose of this subpart, a tank or container that is also equipped with a vent that serves as a process vent, as defined in § 63.7957, is not a remediation material management unit, but instead this unit is considered to be a process vent affected source under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
                (3) Equipment leaks. The affected source is the entire group of equipment components (pumps, valves, etc.) used to manage remediation materials and meeting both of the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. If either of these conditions do not apply to an equipment component, then that component is not part of the affected source for equipment leaks.

                (i) The equipment component contains or contacts remediation material having a concentration of total HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight.
                
                (ii) The equipment component is intended to operate for 300 hours or more during a calendar year in remediation material service, as defined in § 63.7957.
                (b) Each affected source for your site is existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source before July 30, 2002.
                (c) Each affected source for your site is new if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after July 30, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition of reconstruction in § 63.2.
              
              
                § 63.7883
                When do I have to comply with this subpart?
                (a) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you no later than October 9, 2006.
                (b) If you have a new affected source that manages remediation material other than a radioactive mixed waste as defined in § 63.7957, then you must meet the compliance date specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable to your affected source.
                (1) If the affected source's initial startup date is on or before October 8, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you by October 8, 2003.
                (2) If the affected source's initial startup date is after October 8, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you upon initial startup.
                (c) If you have a new affected source that manages remediation material that is a radioactive mixed waste as defined in § 63.7957, then you must meet the compliance date specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable to your affected source.
                (1) If the affected source's initial startup date is on or before October 8, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you no later than October 9, 2006.
                (2) If the affected source's initial startup date is after October 8, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you upon initial startup.
                (d) If your facility is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP as defined in § 63.2, then you must meet the compliance dates specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
                (1) For each source at your facility that is a new affected source subject to this subpart, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you upon initial startup.
                (2) For all other affected sources subject to this subpart, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you no later than 3 years after your facility becomes a major source.
                (e) You must meet the notification requirements, according to the schedule applicable to your facility, as specified in § 63.7950 and in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A. Some of the notifications must be submitted before you are required to comply with the emissions limitations and work practice standards in this subpart.
              
            
            
              General Standards
              
                § 63.7884
                What are the general standards I must meet for each site remediation with affected sources?
                (a) For each site remediation with an affected source designated under § 63.7882, you must meet the standards specified in §§ 63.7885 through 63.7955, as applicable to your affected source, unless your site remediation meets the requirements for an exemption under paragraph (b) of this section.

                (b) A site remediation that is completed within 30 consecutive calendar days according to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section is not subject to the standards under paragraph (a) of this section. This exemption cannot be used for a site remediation involving the staged or intermittent cleanup of remediation material whereby the remediation activities at the site are started, stopped, and then re-started in a series of intervals, with durations less than 30-days per interval, when the time period from the beginning of the first interval to the end of the last interval exceeds 30 days.
                (1) The 30 consecutive calendar day period for a site remediation that qualifies for this exemption is determined according to actions taken by you as defined in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) The first day of the 30-day period is defined as the day on which you initiate any action that removes, destroys, degrades, transforms, immobilizes, or otherwise manages the remediation materials. The following activities, when completed before beginning this initial action, are not counted as part of the 30-day period: Activities to characterize the type and extent of the contamination by collecting and analyzing samples; activities to obtain permits from Federal, State, or local authorities to conduct the site remediation; activities to schedule workers and necessary equipment; and activities to arrange for contractor or third party assistance in performing the site remediation.
                (ii) The last day of the 30-day period is defined as the day on which treatment or disposal of all of the remediation materials generated by the cleanup is completed such that the organic constituents in these materials no longer have a reasonable potential for volatilizing and being released to the atmosphere.
                (iii) If treatment or disposal of the remediation materials is conducted at an off-site facility where the final treatment or disposal of the material cannot, or may not, be completed within the 30-day exemption period, then the shipment of all of the remediation material generated from your cleanup that is transferred to another party, or shipped to another facility, within the 30-day period, must be performed according to the applicable requirements specified in § 63.7936.
                (2) For the purpose of complying with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if you ship or otherwise transfer the remediation material off-site you must include in the applicable shipping documentation, in addition to any notifications and certifications required under § 63.7936, a statement that the shipped material was generated by a site remediation activity subject to the conditions of this exemption. The statement must include the date on which you initiated the site remediation activity generating the shipped remediation materials, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and the date 30 calendar days following your initiation date.
                (3) You must prepare and maintain at your facility written documentation describing the exempted site remediation, and listing the initiation and completion dates for the site remediation.

                (b) For each affected process vent, except as exempted under paragraph (c) of this section, you must meet one of the options in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) You control HAP emissions from the affected process vents according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7890 through 63.7893.
                (2) You determine for the remediation material treated or managed by the process vented through the affected process vents that the average total volatile organic hazardous air pollutant (VOHAP) concentration, as defined in § 63.7957, of this material is less than 10 parts per million by weight (ppmw). Determination of the VOHAP concentration is made using the procedures specified in § 63.7943.

                (3) If the process vent is also subject to another subpart under 40 CFR part 61 or 40 CFR part 63, you control emissions of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart from the affected process vent in compliance with the standards specified in the applicable subpart. This means you are complying with all applicable emissions limitations and work practice standards under the other subpart (e.g., you install and operate the required air pollution controls or have implemented the required work practice to reduce HAP emissions to levels specified by the applicable subpart). This provision does not apply to any exemption of the affected source from the emissions limitations and work practice standards allowed by the other applicable subpart.
                (c) A process vent that meets the exemption requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section is exempted from the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.
                (1) The process vent stream exiting the process vent meets the conditions in either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
                (i) The process vent stream flow rate is less than 0.005 cubic meters per minute (m3/min) at standard conditions (as defined in 40 CFR 63.2); or

                (2) You must demonstrate that the process vent stream meets the applicable exemption conditions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section using the procedures specified in § 63.694(m). You must prepare and maintain documentation at your facility to support your determination of the process vent stream flow rate. This documentation must include identification of each process vent exempted under this paragraph and the test results used to determine the process vent stream flow rate and total HAP concentration, as applicable to the exemption conditions for your process vent. You must perform a new determination of the process vent stream flow rate and total HAP concentration, as applicable to the exemption conditions for your process vent, whenever changes to operation of the unit on which the process vent is used could cause the process vent stream conditions to exceed the maximum limits of the exemption.
              
              
                § 63.7886
                What are the general standards I must meet for my affected remediation material management units?
                (a) For each remediation material management unit that is part of an affected source designated by § 63.7882, you must select and meet the requirements under one of the options specified in paragraph (b) of this section except for those remediation material management units exempted under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.

                (ii) If the remediation material management unit is a container, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7900 through 63.7903.
                (iii) If the remediation material management unit is a surface impoundment, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7905 through 63.7908.
                (iv) If the remediation material management unit is an oil-water or organic-water separator, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7910 through 63.7913.
                (v) If the remediation material management unit is a transfer system, then you control HAP emissions according to the standards specified in §§ 63.7915 through 63.7918.

                (2) You determine that the average total VOHAP concentration, as defined in § 63.7957, of the remediation material managed in the remediation material management unit material is less than 500 ppmw. You must follow the requirements in § 63.7943 to demonstrate that the VOHAP concentration of the remediation material is less than 500 ppmw. Once the VOHAP concentration for a remediation material has been determined to be less than 500 ppmw, all remediation material management units downstream from the point of determination managing this material meet the requirements of this paragraph unless a remediation process is used that concentrates all, or part of, the remediation material being managed in the unit such that the VOHAP concentration of the material could increase. Any free product returned to the manufacturing process (e.g., recovered oil returned to a storage tank at a refinery) is no longer subject to this subpart.

                (3) If the remediation material management unit is also subject to another subpart under 40 CFR part 61 or 40 CFR part 63, you control emissions of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart from the affected remediation material management unit in compliance with the standards specified in the applicable subpart. This means you are complying with all applicable emissions limitations and work practice standards under the other subpart (e.g., you install and operate the required air pollution controls or have implemented the required work practice to reduce HAP emissions to levels specified by the applicable subpart). This provision does not apply to any exemption of the affected source from the emissions limitations and work practice standards allowed by the other applicable subpart.
                (4) If the remediation material management unit is an open tank or surface impoundment used for a biological treatment process, you meet the requirements as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
                (i) You demonstrate that the biological treatment process conducted in the open tank or surface impoundment meets the performance levels specified in either § 63.684(b)(4)(i) or (ii).
                (ii) You monitor the biological treatment process conducted in the open tank or surface impoundment according to the requirements in § 63.684(e)(4).
                (c) A remediation material management unit is exempted from the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section if this unit is used for cleanup of radioactive mixed waste, as defined in § 63.7957, that is subject to applicable regulations, directives, and other requirements under the Atomic Energy Act, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, or the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act.
                (d) One or a combination of remediation material management units may be exempted at your discretion from the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section provided that the total annual quantity of HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart contained in the remediation material placed in all of the remediation material management units exempted under this paragraph is less than 1 Mg/yr. For each remediation material management unit you select to be exempted under this provision, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
                (1) You must designate each of the remediation material management units you are selecting to be exempted under this paragraph by either submitting to the Administrator a written notification identifying the exempt units or permanently marking the exempt units at the faculty site. If you choose to prepare and submit a written notification, this notification must include a site plan, process diagram, or other appropriate documentation identifying each of the exempt units. If you choose to permanently mark the exempt units, each exempt unit must be marked in such a manner that it can be readily identified as an exempt unit from the other remediation material management units located at the site.

                (2) You must prepare an initial determination of the total annual HAP quantity in the remediation material placed in the units exempted under this paragraph. This determination is based on the total quantity of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart as determined at the point where the remediation material is placed in each exempted unit. You must perform a new determination whenever the extent of changes to the quantity or composition of the remediation material placed in the exempted units could cause the total annual HAP content in the remediation material to exceed 1 Mg/yr. You must maintain documentation to support the most recent determination of the total annual HAP quantity. This documentation must include the basis and data used for determining the organic HAP content of the remediation material.

                § 63.7943
                How do I determine the average VOHAP concentration of my remediation material?
                (a) General requirements. You must determine the average total VOHAP concentration of a remediation material using either direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b) of this section or by knowledge as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. These methods may be used to determine the average VOHAP concentration of any material listed in (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) A single remediation material stream; or
                (2) Two or more remediation material streams that are combined prior to, or within, a remediation material management unit or treatment process; or
                (3) Remediation material that is combined with one or more non-remediation material streams prior to, or within, a remediation material management unit or treatment process.
                (b) Direct measurement. To determine the average total VOHAP concentration of a remediation material using direct measurement, you must use the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) Sampling. Samples of each material stream must be collected from the container, pipeline, or other device used to deliver each material stream prior to entering the remediation material management unit or treatment process in a manner such that volatilization of organics contained in the sample is minimized and an adequately representative sample is collected and maintained for analysis by the selected method.
                (i) The averaging period to be used for determining the average total VOHAP concentration for the material stream on a mass-weighted average basis must be designated and recorded. The averaging period can represent any time interval that you determine is appropriate for the material stream but must not exceed 1 year. For streams that are combined, an averaging period representative for all streams must be selected.
                (ii) No less than four samples must be collected to represent the complete range of HAP compositions and HAP quantities that occur in each material stream during the entire averaging period due to normal variations in the material stream(s). Examples of such normal variations are variation of the HAP concentration within a contamination area.
                (iii) All samples must be collected and handled according to written procedures you prepare and document in a site sampling plan. This plan must describe the procedure by which representative samples of the material stream(s) are collected such that a minimum loss of organics occurs throughout the sample collection and handling process and by which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of the written sampling plan must be maintained on site in the facility operating records. An example of an acceptable sampling plan includes a plan incorporating sample collection and handling procedures according to the guidance found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication No. SW-846 or Method 25D in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
                (2) Analysis. Each collected sample must be prepared and analyzed according to either one of the methods listed in § 63.694(b)(2)(ii), or any current EPA Contracts Lab Program method (or future revisions) capable of identifying all the HAP in Table 1 of this subpart.

                (3) Calculations. The average total VOHAP concentration (C) on a mass-weighted basis must be calculated by using the results for all samples analyzed according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section and Equation 1 of this section as follows:
                
                  ER29NO06.007
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  C = Average VOHAP concentration of the material on a mass-weighted basis, ppmw.
                  i = Individual sample “i” of the material.
                  n = Total number of samples of the material collected (at least 4 per stream) for the averaging period (not to exceed 1 year).
                  Qi = Mass quantity of material stream represented by Ci, kilograms per hour (kg/hr).
                  QT = Total mass quantity of all material during the averaging period, kg/hr.
                  Ci = Measured VOHAP concentration of sample “i” as determined according to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, ppmw.
                
                
                (c) Knowledge of the material. To determine the average total VOHAP concentration of a remediation material using knowledge, you must use the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
                (1) Documentation must be prepared that presents the information used as the basis for your knowledge of the material stream's average VOHAP concentration. Examples of information that may be used as the basis for knowledge include: material balances for the source(s) generating each material stream; species-specific chemical test data for the material stream from previous testing that are still applicable to the current material stream; test data for material from the contamination area(s) being remediated.
                (2) If test data are used as the basis for knowledge, then you must document the test method, sampling protocol, and the means by which sampling variability and analytical variability are accounted for in the determination of the average VOHAP concentration. For example, you may use HAP concentration test data for the material stream that are validated according to Method 301 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A as the basis for knowledge of the material. This information must be provided for each material stream where streams are combined.

                (3) If you use species-specific chemical concentration test data as the basis for knowledge of the material, you may adjust the test data to the corresponding average VOHAP concentration value which would be obtained had the material samples been analyzed using Method 305. To adjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual HAP chemical species contained in the material is multiplied by the appropriate species-specific adjustment factor (fm305) listed in Table 1 of this subpart.
                (d) In the event that you and us disagree on a determination using knowledge of the average total VOHAP concentration for a remediation material, then the results from a determination of VOHAP concentration using direct measurement by Method 305 in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, will be used to determine compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. We may perform or request that you perform this determination using direct measurement.

                § 63.7944
                How do I determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure of my remediation material?
                (a) You must determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure of your remediation material using either direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b) of this section or by knowledge as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
                (b) Direct measurement to determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure.

                (1) Sampling. A sufficient number of samples must be collected to be representative of the remediation material contained in the tank. All samples must be collected and handled according to written procedures prepared by you and documented in a site sampling plan. This plan must describe the procedure by which representative samples of the remediation material are collected such that a minimum loss of organics occurs throughout the sample collection and handling process and by which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of the written sampling plan must be maintained on site in the facility site operating records. An example of an acceptable sampling plan includes a plan incorporating sample collection and handling procedures according to the guidance found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication No. SW-846 or Method 25D in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
                (2) Analysis. Any one of the following methods may be used to analyze the samples and compute the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the remediation material:
                (i) Method 25E in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A;
                (ii) Methods described in American Petroleum Institute Bulletin 2517, “Evaporation Loss from External Floating Roof Tanks,”;
                (iii) Methods obtained from standard reference texts;
                (iv) ASTM Method 2879-83; or
                (v) Any other method approved by the Administrator.
                (c) Use of knowledge to determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure. Documentation must be prepared and recorded that presents the information used as the basis for your knowledge that the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the remediation material is less than the maximum vapor pressure limit listed in Table 2 of this subpart for the applicable tank design capacity category.
                (d) In the event that you and us disagree on a determination using knowledge of the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the remediation material, then the results from a determination of maximum HAP vapor pressure using direct measurement by Method 25E in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, will be used to determine compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. We may perform or request that you perform this determination using direct measurement.
              
            
            
              Continuous Monitoring Systems
              
                § 63.7945
                What are my monitoring installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?
                (a) Each CPMS must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
                (1) Complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period.
                (2) To calculate a valid hourly value, you must have at least three of four equally spaced data values (or at least two, if that condition is included to allow for periodic calibration checks) for that hour from a CPMS that is not out of control according to the monitoring plan referenced in § 63.7935.

                (3) To calculate the average emissions for each averaging period, you must have at least 75 percent of the hourly averages for that period using only block hourly average values that are based on valid data (i.e., not from out-of-control periods).
                (4) Unless otherwise specified, each CPMS must determine the hourly average of all recorded readings and daily average, if required.
                (b) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.
                (c) You must conduct a performance evaluation for each CPMS according to the requirements in § 63.8(e) and your site-specific monitoring plan.
              
              
                § 63.7946
                How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
                (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section and your site-specific monitoring plan required in § 63.7935.
                (b) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating.
                (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out of control periods and required quality assurance or control activities in data averages and calculations used to report emissions or operating levels, nor may such data be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement, if applicable. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.
              
              
                
                § 63.7947
                What are my monitoring alternatives?
                (a) As an alternative to the parametric monitoring required in this subpart, you may install, calibrate, and operate a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) to measure the control device outlet total organic emissions or organic HAP emissions concentration.

                (1) The CEMS used on combustion control devices must include a diluent gas monitoring system (for O2 or CO2) with the pollutant monitoring system in order to correct for dilution (e.g., to 0 percent excess air).
                (2) Each CEMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Data must be reduced as specified in § 63.8(g)(2).

                (3) You must conduct a performance evaluation of the CEMS according to the requirements in § 63.8 and Performance Specification 8 (for a total organic emissions CEMS) or Performance Specification 9 (for a HAP emissions CEMS) and Performance Specification 3 (for an O2 or CO2 CEMS) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. The relative accuracy provision of Performance Specification 8, sections 2.4 and 3 need not be conducted.
                (4) You must prepare a site-specific monitoring plan for operating, calibrating, and verifying the operation of your CEMS according to the requirements in §§ 63.8(c), (d), and (e).
                (5) You must establish the emissions concentration operating limit according to paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.
                (i) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the total organic or HAP emissions concentration at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
                (ii) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average total organic or HAP emissions concentration maintained during the performance test. The average total organic or HAP emissions concentration, corrected for dilution as appropriate, is the maximum operating limit for your control device.
                (b) You must maintain the daily (24-hour) average total organic or HAP emissions concentration in the exhaust vent stream of the control device outlet less than or equal to the site-specific operating limit established during the performance test.
              
            
            
              Notification, Reports, and Records
              
                § 63.7950
                What notifications must I submit and when?
                (a) You must submit all of the notifications in §§ 63.7(b) and (c), 63.8(e), 63.8(f)(4) and (6), and 63.9(b) through (h) that apply to you.

                (c) Immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction report. If you had a startup, shutdown, or malfunction during the semiannual reporting period that was not consistent with your startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, you must submit an immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction report according to the requirements of § 63.10(d)(5)(ii) .
                (d) Part 70 monitoring report. If you have obtained a title V operating permit for an affected source pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, you must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If you submit a compliance report for an affected source along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the compliance report includes all the required information concerning deviations from any emissions limitation or operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart, submission of the compliance report satisfies any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a compliance report does not otherwise affect any obligation you may have to report deviations from permit requirements for an affected source to your permitting authority.

                § 63.7957
                What definitions apply to this subpart?

                Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in § 63.2, and in this section. If a term is defined both in this section and in another subpart cross-referenced by this subpart, then the term will have the meaning given in this section for purposes of this subpart.
                
                  Boiler means an enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator or a process heater.
                
                  Closed vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of hard-piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, fans, blowers, or other flow-inducing device that conveys gas or vapor from an emissions point to a control device.
                
                  Closure device means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other type of fitting that prevents or reduces air pollutant emissions to the atmosphere by blocking an opening in a cover when the device is secured in the closed position. Closure devices include devices that are detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap), manually operated (e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a spring-loaded pressure relief valve).
                
                  Container means a portable unit used to hold material. Examples of containers include, but are not limited to drums, dumpsters, roll-off boxes, bulk cargo containers commonly known as portable tanks or totes, cargo tank trucks, dump trucks, and rail cars. For the purpose of this subpart, a front-end loader, excavator, backhoe, or other type of self-propelled excavation equipment is not a container.
                
                  Continuous record means documentation of data values measured at least once every 15 minutes and recorded at the frequency specified in this subpart.
                
                  Continuous recorder means a data recording device that either records an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes or records 15-minutes or more frequent block averages.
                
                  Control device means equipment used recovering, removing, oxidizing, or destroying organic vapors. Examples of such equipment include but are not limited to carbon adsorbers, condensers, vapor incinerators, flares, boilers, and process heaters.
                
                  Cover means a device that prevents or reduces air pollutant emissions to the atmosphere by forming a continuous barrier over the remediation material managed in a unit. A cover may have openings (such as access hatches, sampling ports, gauge wells) that are necessary for operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of the unit on which the cover is used. A cover may be a separate piece of equipment which can be detached and removed from the unit (such as a tarp) or a cover may be formed by structural features permanently integrated into the design of the unit.
                
                  Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
                (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation (including any operating limit), or work practice standard;
                (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or
                (3) Fails to meet any emissions limitation, (including any operating limit), or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.
                
                  Emissions limitation means any emissions limit, opacity limit, operating limit, or visible emissions limit.
                
                  Emissions point means an individual tank, surface impoundment, container, oil-water, organic-water separator, transfer system, vent, or enclosure.
                
                  Enclosure means a structure that surrounds a tank or container, captures organic vapors emitted from the tank or container, and vents the captured vapor through a closed vent system to a control device.
                
                  Equipment means each pump, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, valve, and connector used in remediation material service at a facility.
                
                  External floating roof means a pontoon-type or double-deck type cover that rests on the liquid surface in a tank with no fixed roof.
                
                  Facility means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common control including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof. A unit or group of units within a contiguous property that are not under common control (e.g., a wastewater treatment unit located at the facility but is owned by a different company) is a different facility.
                
                  Fixed roof means a cover that is mounted on a unit in a stationary position and does not move with fluctuations in the level of the liquid managed in the unit.
                
                  Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler or process heater occupied by the flame envelope.
                
                  Floating roof means a cover consisting of a double deck, pontoon single deck, or internal floating cover which rests upon and is supported by the liquid being contained, and is equipped with a continuous seal.
                
                  Flow indicator means a device that indicates whether gas is flowing, or whether the valve position would allow gas to flow in a bypass line.
                
                  Hard-piping means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly installed according to relevant standards and good engineering practices.
                
                  Individual drain system means a stationary system used to convey wastewater streams or residuals to a remediation material management unit or to discharge or disposal. The term includes hard-piping, all drains and junction boxes, together with their associated sewer lines and other junction boxes (e.g., manholes, sumps, and lift stations) conveying wastewater streams or residuals. For the purpose of this subpart, an individual drain system is not a drain and collection system that is designed and operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall runoff (e.g., stormwater sewer system) and is segregated from all other individual drain systems.
                
                  Internal floating roof means a cover that rests or floats on the liquid surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it inside a tank that has a fixed roof).
                
                  Maximum HAP vapor pressure means the sum of the individual HAP equilibrium partial pressure exerted by remediation material at the temperature equal to either: the monthly average temperature as reported by the National Weather Service when the remediation material is stored or treated at ambient temperature; or the highest calendar-month average temperature of the remediation material when the remediation material is stored at temperatures above the ambient temperature or when the remediation material is stored or treated at temperatures below the ambient temperature. For the purpose of this subpart, maximum HAP vapor pressure is determined using the procedures specified in § 63.7944.
                
                  No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in § 63.694(k).
                
                  Oil-water separator means a separator as defined for this subpart that is used to separate oil from water.
                
                  Operating parameter value means a minimum or maximum value established for a control device or treatment process parameter which, if achieved by itself or in combination with one or more other operating parameter values, determines that an owner or operator has complied with an applicable emissions limitation or standard.
                
                  Organic-water separator means a separator as defined for this subpart that is used to separate organics from water.
                
                  Process heater means an enclosed combustion device that transfers heat released by burning fuel directly to process streams or to heat transfer liquids other than water.
                
                  Process vent means any open-ended pipe, stack, duct, or other opening intended to allow the passage of gases, vapors, or fumes to the atmosphere and this passage is caused by mechanical means (such as compressors, vacuum-producing systems or fans) or by process-related means (such as volatilization produced by heating). For the purposes of this subpart, a process vent is neither a safety device (as defined in this section) nor a stack, duct or other opening used to exhaust combustion products from a boiler, furnace, heater, incinerator, or other combustion device.
                
                  Radioactive mixed waste means a material that contains both hazardous waste subject to RCRA and source, special nuclear, or by-product material subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
                
                  Remediation material means a material that contains one or more of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart, and this material is one of the following:
                (1) A material found in naturally occurring media such as soil, groundwater, surface water, sediments, or a mixture of such materials with liquids, sludges, or solids which is inseparable by simple mechanical removal processes and is made up primarily of media. This material does not include debris as defined in 40 CFR 268.2.
                (2) A material found in intact or substantially intact containers, tanks, storage piles, or other storage units that requires clean up because this material poses a reasonable potential threat to contaminating media. Examples of these materials include, but are not limited to, solvents, oils, paints, and other volatile or semi-volatile organic liquids found in buried drums, cans, or other containers; gasoline, fuel oil, or other fuels in leaking underground storage tanks; and solid materials containing volatile or semi-volatile organics in unused or abandoned piles. Remediation material is not a waste or residue generated by routine equipment maintenance activities performed at a facility such as, but not limited to, tank bottoms and sludges removed during tank cleanouts; sludges and sediments removed from active wastewater treatment tanks, surface impoundments, or lagoons; spent catalyst removed from process equipment; residues removed from air pollution control equipment; and debris removed during heat exchanger and pipeline cleanouts.
                
                  Remediation material management unit means a tank, container, surface impoundment, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system used to remove, destroy, degrade, transform, immobilize, or otherwise manage remediation material.
                
                  Remediation material service means any time when a pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, or instrumentation system contains or contacts remediation material.
                
                  Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.
                
                  Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of this Subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
                
                  Separator means a remediation material management unit, generally a tank, used to separate oil or organics from water. A separator consists of not only the separation unit but also the forebay and other separator basins, skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, sludge hoppers, and bar screens that are located directly after the individual drain system and prior to any additional treatment units such as an air flotation unit clarifier or biological treatment unit. Examples of a separator include, but are not limited to, an API separator, parallel-plate interceptor, and corrugated-plate interceptor with the associated ancillary equipment.
                
                
                  Site remediation means one or more activities or processes used to remove, destroy, degrade, transform, immobilize, or otherwise manage remediation material. The monitoring or measuring of contamination levels in environmental media using wells or by sampling is not considered to be a site remediation.
                
                  Sludge means sludge as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter.
                
                  Soil means unconsolidated earth material composing the superficial geologic strata (material overlying bedrock), consisting of clay, silt, sand, or gravel size particles (sizes as classified by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service), or a mixture of such materials with liquids, sludges, or solids which is inseparable by simple mechanical removal processes and is made up primarily of soil.
                
                  Stabilization process means any physical or chemical process used to either reduce the mobility of contaminants in media or eliminate free liquids as determined by Test Method 9095—Paint Filter Liquids Test in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication No. SW-846, Third Edition, September 1986, as amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. (As an alternative, you may use any more recent, updated version of Method 9095 approved by the EPA). A stabilization process includes mixing remediation material with binders or other materials, and curing the resulting remediation material and binder mixture. Other synonymous terms used to refer to this process are fixation or solidification. A stabilization process does not include the adding of absorbent materials to the surface of remediation material, without mixing, agitation, or subsequent curing, to absorb free liquid.
                
                  Surface impoundment means a unit that is a natural topographical depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids. Examples of surface impoundments include holding, storage, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.
                
                  Tank means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic) which provide structural support and is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids or other materials.
                
                  Temperature monitoring device means a piece of equipment used to monitor temperature and having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius (°C) or ±1.2 degrees °C, whichever value is greater.
                
                  Transfer system means a stationary system for which the predominant function is to convey liquids or solid materials from one point to another point within a waste management operation or recovery operation. For the purpose of this subpart, the conveyance of material using a container (as defined for this subpart) or a self-propelled vehicle (e.g., a front-end loader) is not a transfer system. Examples of a transfer system include but are not limited to a pipeline, an individual drain system, a gravity-operated conveyor (such as a chute), and a mechanically-powered conveyor (such as a belt or screw conveyor).
                
                  Treatment process means a process in which remediation material is physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated to destroy, degrade, or remove hazardous air pollutants contained in the material. A treatment process can be composed of a single unit (e.g., a steam stripper) or a series of units (e.g., a wastewater treatment system). A treatment process can be used to treat one or more remediation material streams at the same time.
                
                  Volatile organic hazardous air pollutant (VOHAP) concentration means the fraction by weight of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart that are contained in the remediation material as measured using Method 305, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A and expressed in terms of parts per million (ppm). As an alternative to using Method 305, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, you may determine the HAP concentration of the remediation material using any one of the other test methods specified in § 63.694(b)(2)(ii). When a test method specified in § 63.694(b)(2)(ii) other than Method 305 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A is used to determine the speciated HAP concentration of the contaminated material, the individual compound concentration may be adjusted by the corresponding fm305 listed in Table 1 of this subpart to determine a VOHAP concentration.
                
                  Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated pursuant to section 112(h) of the CAA.

                § 63.8000
                What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
                (a) You must be in compliance with the emission limits and work practice standards in Tables 1 through 5 to this subpart at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. You must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. You must meet the requirements specified in §§ 63.8005 through 63.8025 (or the alternative means of compliance in § 63.8050), except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. You must meet the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specified in §§ 63.8070, 63.8075, and 63.8080.
                (b) General requirements. (1) If an emission stream contains halogen atoms, and you use a combustion-based control device (excluding a flare) to meet an organic HAP emission limit, you must determine whether the emission stream meets the definition of a halogenated stream by calculating the concentration of each organic compound that contains halogen atoms using the procedures specified in § 63.115(d)(2)(v), multiplying each concentration by the number of halogen atoms in the organic compound, and summing the resulting halogen atom concentrations for all of the organic compounds in the emission stream. Alternatively, you may elect to designate the emission stream as halogenated.
                (2) Opening of a safety device, as defined in § 63.8105, is allowed at any time conditions require it to avoid unsafe conditions.
                (c) Compliance requirements for closed vent systems and control devices. If you use a control device to comply with an emission limit in Table 1, 2, or 5 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63 as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (1) If you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to any combination of control devices (except a flare), you must meet the requirements of § 63.982(c) and the requirements referenced therein.
                (2) If you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to a flare, you must meet the requirements of § 63.982(b) and the requirements referenced therein. You may not use a flare to control halogenated vent streams or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions.
                (3) If you use a halogen reduction device to reduce hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions that are generated by combusting halogenated vent streams, you must meet the requirements of § 63.994 and the requirements referenced therein. If you use a halogen reduction device before a combustion device, you must determine the halogen atom emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in § 63.115(d)(2)(v).
                (d) Exceptions to the requirements specified in other subparts of this part 63—(1) Requirements for performance tests. The requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (v) of this section apply instead of or in addition to the requirements for performance testing of control devices as specified in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63.
                (i) Conduct gas molecular weight analysis using Method 3, 3A, or 3B in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
                (ii) Measure moisture content of the stack gas using Method 4 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
                (iii) As an alternative to using Method 18, Method 25/25A, or Method 26/26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to comply with any of the emission limits specified in Tables 1 through 6 to this subpart, you may use Method 320 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. When using Method 320, you must follow the analyte spiking procedures of section 13 of Method 320, unless you demonstrate that the complete spiking procedure has been conducted at a similar source.

                (iv) Section 63.997(c)(1) does not apply. For the purposes of this subpart, results of all initial compliance demonstrations must be included in the notification of compliance status report, which is due 150 days after the compliance date, as specified in § 63.8075(d)(1).
                
                (v) If you do not have a closed-vent system as defined in § 63.981, you must determine capture efficiency using Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for all stationary process vessels subject to requirements of Table 1 to this subpart.
                (2) Design evaluation. To determine the percent reduction of a small control device, you may elect to conduct a design evaluation as specified in § 63.1257(a)(1) instead of a performance test as specified in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63. You must establish the value(s) and basis for the operating limits as part of the design evaluation.
                (3) Periodic verification. For a control device with total inlet HAP emissions less than 1 ton per year (tpy), you must establish an operating limit(s) for a parameter(s) that you will measure and record at least once per averaging period (i.e., daily or block) to verify that the control device is operating properly. You may elect to measure the same parameter(s) that is required for control devices that control inlet HAP emissions equal to or greater than 1 tpy. If the parameter will not be measured continuously, you must request approval of your proposed procedure in the precompliance report. You must identify the operating limit(s) and the measurement frequency, and you must provide rationale to support how these measurements demonstrate the control device is operating properly.
                (4) Continuous emissions monitoring systems. Each continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) must be installed, operated, and maintained according to the requirements in § 63.8 and paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
                (i) Each CEMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and according to paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section. For any CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8, you must also comply with appendix F, procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60.
                (A) If you wish to use a CEMS other than a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 15 to measure hydrogen halide and halogen HAP before we promulgate a Performance Specification for such CEMS, you must prepare a monitoring plan and submit it for approval in accordance with the procedures specified in § 63.8.
                (B) [Reserved]
                (ii) You must determine the calibration gases and reporting units for TOC CEMS in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
                (A) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 9 or 15 requirements, determine the target analyte(s) for calibration using either process knowledge of the control device inlet stream or the screening procedures of Method 18 on the control device inlet stream.

                (B) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a combustion device, calibrate the instrument on the predominant organic HAP and report the results as carbon (C1), and use Method 25A or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests.

                (C) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor performance of a noncombustion device, determine the predominant organic HAP using either process knowledge or the screening procedures of Method 18 on the control device inlet stream, calibrate the monitor on the predominant organic HAP, and report the results as C1. Use Method 18, ASTM D6420-99, or any approved alternative as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests, and report the results as C1.
                (iii) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, except that the schedule in § 63.8(e)(4) does not apply, and the results of the performance evaluation must be included in the notification of compliance status report.

                (iv) The CEMS data must be reduced to operating day or operating block averages computed using valid data consistent with the data availability requirements specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(i)(B) through (D), except monitoring data also are sufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are available for at least two of the 15-minute periods during an hour when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities are being performed. An operating block is a period of time from the beginning to end of batch operations in the manufacturing of a coating. Operating block averages may be used only for process vessel data.
                (5) Continuous parameter monitoring. The provisions in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section apply in addition to the requirements for continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63.
                (i) You must record the results of each calibration check and all maintenance performed on the CPMS as specified in § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(A).
                (ii) When subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63 uses the term a range or operating range of a monitored parameter, it means an operating limit for a monitored parameter for the purposes of this subpart.
                (iii) As an alternative to measuring pH as specified in § 63.994(c)(1)(i), you may elect to continuously monitor the caustic strength of the scrubber effluent.
                (6) Startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Sections 63.998(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(6)(i)(A), which apply to the exclusion of monitoring data collected during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) from daily averages, do not apply for the purposes of this subpart.
                (7) Reporting. (i) When §§ 63.8005 through 63.8025 reference other subparts in this part 63 that use the term periodic report, it means compliance report for the purposes of this subpart.
                (ii) When there are conflicts between this subpart and referenced subparts for the due dates of reports required by this subpart, reports must be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.
                (iii) Excused excursions, as defined in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63, are not allowed.

                § 63.8005
                What requirements apply to my process vessels?
                (a) General. (1) You must meet each emission limit and work practice standard in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you, and you must meet each applicable requirement specified in § 63.8000(b), except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
                (i) You are not required to meet the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart if you comply with § 63.8050 or § 63.8055.
                (ii) You must meet the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart for emissions from automatic cleaning operations. You are not required to meet the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart for emissions from cleaning operations that are conducted manually.
                (2) For each control device used to comply with Table 1 to this subpart, you must comply with subpart SS of this part 63 as specified in § 63.8000(c), except as specified in § 63.8000(d) and paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.
                (b) When subpart SS of this part 63 refers to process vents, it means process vessel vents for the purposes of this section.
                (c) Process condensers, as defined in § 63.1251, are not considered to be control devices for process vessels.
                (d) Initial compliance. (1) To demonstrate initial compliance with a percent reduction emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct the performance test or design evaluation under conditions as specified in § 63.7(e)(1), except that the performance test or design evaluation must be conducted under worst-case conditions. Also, the performance test for a control device used to control emissions from process vessels must be conducted according to § 63.1257(b)(8), including the submittal of a site-specific test plan for approval prior to testing. The requirements in § 63.997(e)(1)(i) and (iii) also do not apply for performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission limits for process vessels.

                (2) For the initial compliance demonstration for condensers, you must determine uncontrolled emissions using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2), and you must determine controlled emissions using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) and (iii).

                (3) You must demonstrate that each process condenser is properly operated according to the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(4)(ii) and (d)(3)(iii)(B). The reference in § 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B) to the alternative standard in § 63.1254(c) does not apply for the purposes of this subpart. As an alternative to measuring the exhaust gas temperature, as required by § 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B), you may elect to measure the liquid temperature in the receiver.
                (4) You must conduct a performance test or compliance demonstration equivalent to an initial compliance demonstration within 360 hours of a change in operating conditions that are not considered to be within the previously established worst-case conditions.
                (e) Establishing operating limits. You must establish operating limits under the conditions required for your initial compliance demonstration, except you may elect to establish operating limit(s) for conditions other than those under which a performance test was conducted as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
                (1) The operating limits may be based on the results of the performance test and supplementary information such as engineering assessments and manufacturer's recommendations. These limits may be established for conditions as unique as individual emission episodes. You must provide rationale in the precompliance report for the specific level for each operating limit, including any data and calculations used to develop the limit and a description of why the limit indicates proper operation of the control device. The procedures provided in this paragraph (e)(1) have not been approved by the Administrator and determination of the operating limit using these procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.
                (2) If you elect to establish separate operating limits for different emission episodes, you must maintain records as specified in § 63.8085(g) of each point at which you change from one operating limit to another, even if the duration of the monitoring for an operating limit is less than 15 minutes.
                (f) Averaging periods. If you elect to establish separate operating limits for different emission episodes, you may elect to determine operating block averages instead of the daily averages specified in § 63.998(b)(3). An operating block is a period of time that is equal to the time from the beginning to end of an emission episode or sequence of emission episodes.
                (g) Flow indicators. If flow to a control device could be intermittent, you must install, calibrate, and operate a flow indicator at the inlet or outlet of the control device to identify periods of no flow. Periods of no flow may not be used in daily or block averages, and it may not be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement.

                (b) Exceptions to requirements in § 63.424(a). (1) When § 63.424(a) refers to “a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station subject to the provisions of this subpart,” the phrase “a miscellaneous coating manufacturing affected source subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart HHHHH” shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.
                (2) When § 63.424(a) refers to “equipment in gasoline service,” the phrase “equipment in organic HAP service” shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.
                (3) When § 63.424(a) specifies that “each piece of equipment shall be inspected during loading of a gasoline cargo tank,” the phrase “each piece of equipment must be inspected when it is operating in organic HAP service” shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.
                (4) Equipment in service less than 300 hours per year, equipment in vacuum service, or equipment contacting non-process fluids is excluded from this section.
                (c) When § 63.1036 refers to batch processes, any part of the miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations applies for the purposes of this subpart.
                (d) For the purposes of this subpart, pressure testing for leaks in accordance with § 63.1036(b) is not required after reconfiguration of an equipment train if flexible hose connections are the only disturbed equipment.

              Alternative Means of Compliance
              
                § 63.8050
                How do I comply with emissions averaging for stationary process vessels at existing sources?

                (a) As an alternative to complying with the requirements in Table 1 to this subpart for each individual stationary process vessel, you may elect to comply with emissions averaging for stationary process vessels greater than or equal to 250 gallons (gal) at your existing affected source as specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
                (b) General requirements. (1) A State may prohibit averaging of HAP emissions and require the owner or operator of an existing affected source to comply with the emission limits and work practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart.
                (2) All stationary process vessels in an emissions averaging group must be equipped with a tightly-fitting vented cover.
                (c) Initial compliance. To demonstrate initial compliance with the emissions averaging alternative, you must comply with the provisions in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
                (1) Estimate uncontrolled emissions from each affected stationary process vessel in pounds per batch using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2), except as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. For the purposes of this section, uncontrolled emissions means the emissions from the vessel if it were equipped only with a tightly-fitting vented cover. You must identify the range of typical operating parameters and perform the calculation using the values that result in the highest emissions, and you must document the operating parameters and resulting emissions calculations in the precompliance report.
                (i) When you are required to calculate uncontrolled emissions from heating, you may not calculate emissions using Equation 13 of subpart GGG of this part 63.
                (ii) The statement in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(B) that “the partial pressure of HAP shall be assumed to be 25 percent of the saturated value if the purge flow rate is greater than 100 scfm” does not apply. For the purposes of this subpart, multiply the HAP partial pressure in Equation 12 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG by a HAP-specific saturation factor determined in accordance with Equations 1 through 3 of this section. Solve equation 1 of this section iteratively beginning with saturation factors (in the right-hand side of the equation) of 1.0 for each condensable compound. Stop iterating when the calculated saturation factors for all compounds are the same to two significant figures for subsequent iterations. Note that for multi-component emission streams, saturation factors must be calculated for all condensable compounds, not just the HAP.

                  S1 = saturation factor for individual condensable compounds in the emission stream
                  Pi = partial pressure of individual condensable compounds in the emission stream calculated using Raoult's Law or other appropriate methods
                  PT = pressure of the vessel vapor space
                  A = surface area of liquid
                  V = purge flow rate as used in Equation 12 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG
                  Vi
                    sat = volumetric flowrate of condensable compounds in the emission stream
                  Ki = mass transfer coefficient of individual condensable compounds in the emission stream
                  Ko = mass transfer coefficient of a reference compound (e.g., 0.83 cm/s for water)
                  Mo = molecular weight of reference compound (e.g., 18.02 for water)
                  Mi = molecular weight of individual condensable compounds in the emission stream
                  n = number of condensable compounds in the emission stream
                
                
                (2) Estimate controlled emissions in pounds per batch for each vessel as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) Except as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, estimate controlled emissions as if the vessel were controlled in compliance with entry 2.b.i. in Table 1 to this subpart.

                (ii) Estimate the controlled emissions using the control level achieved on November 15, 1990 if that value is greater than the applicable control level required by entry 2.b.i in Table 1 to this subpart.
                
                (iii) Estimate the controlled emissions using the control level required to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart if that level is greater than the applicable control level required by entry 2.b.i in Table 1 to this subpart and the other rule was in effect before the date when you request approval to comply with emissions averaging.
                (3) Determine actual emissions in pounds per batch for each vessel in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, as applicable.
                (4) Provide rationale in the precompliance report for why the sum of the actual emissions will be less than the sum of emissions from the vessels if they had been controlled in accordance with Table 1 to this subpart. The approved actual emissions calculated according to paragraph (c)(3) of this section are emission limits that must be incorporated into your operating permit.
                (d) Continuous compliance. (1) Maintain a monthly log of the number of batches produced that can be correlated with the emissions estimates per batch developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
                (2) Sum the actual emissions for all of the process vessels in the emissions averaging group every three months, with the first 3-month period beginning on the compliance date, and compare the resulting total with the total emissions for the vessels calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Compliance is demonstrated if the sum of the actual emissions is less than the emissions estimated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
                (3) For control devices, establish operating limits and monitor as specified in § 63.8000.
                (e) Recordkeeping and reporting. Comply with §§ 63.8070, 63.8075, and 63.8080.

                § 63.8055
                How do I comply with a weight percent HAP limit in coating products?
                (a) As an alternative to complying with the requirements in Table 1 to this subpart for each individual stationary process vessel at an existing source, you may elect to comply with a 5 weight percent HAP limit for process vessels at your affected source that are used to manufacture coatings with a HAP content of less than 0.05 kg per kg product as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
                (b) You may only comply with the alternative during the production of coatings that contain less than 5 weight percent HAP, as determined using any of the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
                (1) Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).
                (2) Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). You may use Method 24 to determine the mass fraction of volatile matter and use that value as a substitute for the mass fraction of HAP.
                (3) You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.
                (4) You may rely on formulation data from raw material suppliers if it represents each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens, as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4), and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. If the HAP weight percent estimated based on formulation data conflicts with the results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, then there is a rebuttal presumption that the test results are accurate unless, after consultation, you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the permitting authority that the test results are not accurate and that the formulation data are more appropriate.

                  Note to definition for point of determination:
                  The regulation allows determination of the characteristics of a wastewater stream at the point of determination or downstream of the point of determination if corrections are made for changes in flow rate and annual average concentration of partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds as determined in § 63.144. Such changes include losses by air emissions; reduction of annual average concentration or changes in flow rate by mixing with other water or wastewater streams; and reduction in flow rate or annual average concentration by treating or otherwise handling the wastewater stream to remove or destroy HAP.

                  Process vessel vent means a vent from a process vessel or vents from multiple process vessels that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Emission streams that are undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP, as determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in § 63.1257(d)(2)(ii), test data using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or any other test method that has been validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part, are not considered process vessel vents. Flexible elephant trunk systems when used with closed vent systems and drawing ambient air (i.e., the system is not ducted, piped, or otherwise connected to the unit operations) away from operators when vessels are opened are not process vessel vents. Process vessel vents do not include vents on storage tanks, wastewater emission sources, or pieces of equipment subject to the requirements in Table 3 of this subpart. A gas stream going to a fuel gas system is not a process vessel vent. A gas stream routed to a process for a process purpose is not a process vessel vent.
                
                  Recovery device, as used in the wastewater provisions, means an individual unit of equipment used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices include organic removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. To be a recovery device, a decanter and any other equipment based on the operating principle of gravity separation must receive only multi-phase liquid streams. A recovery device is considered part of the miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations.
                
                  Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.
                
                  Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
                
                  Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source, any process vessels within an affected source, or equipment required or used to comply with this subpart if steps taken to cease operation differ from those under routine procedures for removing the vessel or equipment from service. Shutdown also applies to the emptying and degassing of storage tanks.
                
                  Small control device means a control device that controls total HAP emissions of less than 10 tpy, before control.

                  Startup means the setting in operation of a new affected source. For new equipment added to an affected source, including equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, startup means the first time the equipment is put into operation. Startup includes the setting in operation of equipment any time the steps taken differ from routine procedures for putting the equipment into operation.
                
                  Storage tank means a tank or other vessel that is used to store organic liquids that contain one or more HAP as raw material feedstocks or products. The following are not considered storage tanks for the purposes of this subpart:
                (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, railcars, barges, or ships;
                (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;

                (3) Vessels storing organic liquids that contain HAP only as impurities;
                
                (4) Wastewater storage tanks; and

              68 FR 70928, Dec. 19, 2003, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              What This Subpart Covers
              
                § 63.8180
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for affected sources of mercury emissions at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with all applicable emission limitations and work practice standards in this subpart.
              
              
                
                § 63.8182
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a mercury cell chlor-alkali plant.
                (b) You are required to obtain a title V permit, whether your affected source is a part of a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions or a part of an area source of HAP emissions. A major source of HAP is a source that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons or more per year. An area source of HAP is a source that has the potential to emit HAP but is not a major source. Nothing in this subpart revises how affected sources are aggregated for purposes of determining whether an affected source is a part of an area, nonmajor, or major source under any provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA) or EPA's regulations. For information on aggregating affected sources to determine what is a source under title V, see the definition of major source in 40 CFR 70.2, 71.2 and 63.2.
                (c) Beginning on December 19, 2006, the provisions of subpart E of 40 CFR part 61 that apply to mercury chlor-alkali plants, which are listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, are no longer applicable.
                (1) § 61.52(a);
                (2) § 61.53(b) and (c); and
                (3) § 61.55(b), (c) and (d).
              
              
                § 63.8184
                What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
                (a) This subpart applies to each affected source at a plant site where chlorine and caustic are produced in mercury cells. This subpart applies to two types of affected sources: the mercury cell chlor-alkali production facility, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and the mercury recovery facility, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
                (1) The mercury cell chlor-alkali production facility designates an affected source consisting of all cell rooms and ancillary operations used in the manufacture of product chlorine, product caustic, and by-product hydrogen at a plant site. This subpart covers mercury emissions from by-product hydrogen streams, end box ventilation system vents, and fugitive emission sources associated with cell rooms, hydrogen systems, caustic systems, and storage areas for mercury-containing wastes.
                (2) The mercury recovery facility designates an affected source consisting of all processes and associated operations needed for mercury recovery from wastes at a plant site. This subpart covers mercury emissions from mercury thermal recovery unit vents and fugitive emission sources associated with storage areas for mercury-containing wastes.
                (b) An affected source at your mercury cell chlor-alkali plant is existing if you commenced construction of the affected source before July 3, 2002.
                (c) A mercury recovery facility is a new affected source if you commence construction or reconstruction of the affected source after July 3, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition of “reconstruction” in § 63.2.
              
              
                § 63.8186
                When do I have to comply with this subpart?
                (a) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and recordkeeping and reporting requirement in this subpart that applies to you no later than December 19, 2006.
                (b) If you have a new or reconstructed mercury recovery facility and its initial startup date is on or before December 19, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and recordkeeping and reporting requirement in this subpart that applies to you by December 19, 2003.
                (c) If you have a new or reconstructed mercury recovery facility and its initial startup date is after December 19, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and recordkeeping and reporting requirement in this subpart that applies to you upon initial startup.
                (d) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in § 63.8252. Several of these notifications must be submitted before the compliance date for your affected source(s).

              Source:
              80 FR 65520, Oct. 26, 2015, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              What This Subpart Covers
              
                § 63.8380
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes national emission limitations for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from brick and structural clay products (BSCP) manufacturing facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations.
              
              
                § 63.8385
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a BSCP manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of, a major source of HAP emissions according to the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
                (a) A BSCP manufacturing facility is a plant site that manufactures brick (including, but not limited to, face brick, structural brick, and brick pavers); clay pipe; roof tile; extruded floor and wall tile; and/or other extruded, dimensional clay products. Brick and structural clay products manufacturing facilities typically process raw clay and shale, form the processed materials into bricks or shapes, and dry and fire the bricks or shapes. A plant site that manufactures refractory products, as defined in § 63.9824, or clay ceramics, as defined in § 63.8665, is not a BSCP manufacturing facility.
                (b) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
              
              
                
                § 63.8390
                What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
                (a) This subpart applies to each existing, new, or reconstructed affected source at a BSCP manufacturing facility.
                (b) For the purposes of this subpart, the affected sources are described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
                (1) All tunnel kilns at a BSCP manufacturing facility are an affected source. For the remainder of this subpart, a tunnel kiln with a design capacity equal to or greater than 9.07 megagrams per hour (Mg/hr) (10 tons per hour (tph)) of fired product will be called a large tunnel kiln, and a tunnel kiln with a design capacity less than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) of fired product will be called a small tunnel kiln.
                (2) Each periodic kiln is an affected source.
                (c) Process units not subject to the requirements of this subpart are listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
                (1) Kilns that are used exclusively for setting glazes on previously fired products are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
                (2) Raw material processing and handling.
                (3) Dryers.
                (4) Sources covered by subparts KKKKK and SSSSS of this part.
                (d) A source is a new affected source if construction of the affected source began after December 18, 2014, and you met the applicability criteria at the time you began construction.
                (e) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as defined in § 63.2.
                (f) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.
              
              
                § 63.8395
                When do I have to comply with this subpart?
                (a) You must comply with this subpart no later than the compliance dates in Table 7 to this subpart.
                (b) You must meet the notification requirements in § 63.8480 according to the schedule in § 63.8480 and in subpart A of this part. Some of the notifications must be submitted before you are required to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart.
              
            
            
              Emission Limitations and Work Practice Standards
              
                § 63.8405

              General Compliance Requirements
              
                § 63.8420
                What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
                (a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations (including operating limits) in this subpart at all times, except during periods that you are approved for and in compliance with the alternative standard for routine control device maintenance as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and except during periods of start-up and shutdown, at which time you must comply with the applicable work practice standard specified in Table 3 to this subpart.

                (b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source. During the period between the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.8395 and the date upon which continuous monitoring systems (CMS) (e.g., continuous parameter monitoring systems) have been installed and verified and any applicable operating limits have been set, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the process and emissions control equipment.
                (c) For each affected kiln that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must prepare and implement a written operation, maintenance, and monitoring (OM&M) plan according to the requirements in § 63.8425.
                (d) If you own or operate an affected kiln that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart and must perform routine maintenance on the control device for that kiln, you may bypass the kiln control device and continue operating the kiln subject to the alternative standard established in this paragraph upon approval by the Administrator and provided you satisfy the conditions listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.
                (1) You must request to use the routine control device maintenance alternative standard from the Administrator no later than 120 calendar days before the compliance date specified in § 63.8395. Your request must justify the need for the routine maintenance on the control device and the time required to accomplish the maintenance activities, describe the maintenance activities and the frequency of the maintenance activities, explain why the maintenance cannot be accomplished during kiln shutdowns, provide information stating whether the continued operation of the affected source will result in fewer emissions than shutting the source down while the maintenance is performed, describe how you plan to comply with paragraph (b) of this section during the maintenance, and provide any other documentation required by the Administrator.
                (2) The routine control device maintenance must not exceed 4 percent of the annual operating uptime for each kiln.
                (3) The request for the routine control device maintenance alternative standard, if approved by the Administrator, must be incorporated by reference in and attached to the affected source's title V permit.
                (4) You must minimize HAP emissions during the period when the kiln is operating and the control device is offline by complying with the applicable standard in Table 3 to this subpart.
                (5) You must minimize the time period during which the kiln is operating and the control device is offline.
                (e) You must be in compliance with the work practice standards in this subpart at all times.

                (f) You must be in compliance with the provisions of subpart A of this part, except as noted in Table 10 to this subpart.
              
              
                § 63.8425
                What do I need to know about operation, maintenance, and monitoring plans?
                (a) For each affected kiln that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must prepare, implement, and revise as necessary an OM&M plan that includes the information in paragraph (b) of this section. Your OM&M plan must be available for inspection by the delegated authority upon request.
                (b) Your OM&M plan must include, as a minimum, the information in paragraphs (b)(1) through (13) of this section.
                (1) Each process and APCD to be monitored, the type of monitoring device that will be used, and the operating parameters that will be monitored.
                (2) A monitoring schedule that specifies the frequency that the parameter values will be determined and recorded.
                (3) The limits for each parameter that represent continuous compliance with the emission limitations in § 63.8405. The limits must be based on values of the monitored parameters recorded during performance tests.
                (4) Procedures for the proper operation and routine and long-term maintenance of each APCD, including a maintenance and inspection schedule that is consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations.

                (5) Procedures for installing the CMS sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last APCD).
                (6) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction system.

                (7) Continuous monitoring system performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations).
                (8) Procedures for the proper operation and maintenance of monitoring equipment consistent with the requirements in §§ 63.8450 and 63.8(c)(1), (3), (7), and (8).

                (9) Continuous monitoring system data quality assurance procedures consistent with the requirements in § 63.8(d)(1) and (2). The owner or operator shall keep these written procedures on record for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part, to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator. If the performance evaluation plan in § 63.8(d)(2) is revised, the owner or operator shall keep previous (i.e., superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. The program of corrective action should be included in the plan required under § 63.8(d)(2).
                (10) Continuous monitoring system recordkeeping and reporting procedures consistent with the requirements in §§ 63.8485 and 63.8490.
                (11) Procedures for responding to operating parameter deviations, including the procedures in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) through (iii) of this section.
                (i) Procedures for determining the cause of the operating parameter deviation.
                (ii) Actions necessary for correcting the deviation and returning the operating parameters to the allowable limits.
                (iii) Procedures for recording the times that the deviation began and ended and corrective actions were initiated and completed.
                (12) Procedures for keeping records to document compliance.
                (13) If you operate an affected kiln and you plan to take the kiln control device out of service for routine maintenance, as specified in § 63.8420(d), the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(13)(i) and (ii) of this section.
                (i) Procedures for minimizing HAP emissions from the kiln during periods of routine maintenance of the kiln control device when the kiln is operating and the control device is offline.

                (ii) Procedures for minimizing the duration of any period of routine maintenance on the kiln control device when the kiln is operating and the control device is offline.
                
                (c) Changes to the operating limits in your OM&M plan require a new performance test. If you are revising an operating limit parameter value, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
                (1) Submit a notification of performance test to the Administrator as specified in § 63.7(b).
                (2) After completing the performance tests to demonstrate that compliance with the emission limits can be achieved at the revised operating limit parameter value, you must submit the performance test results and the revised operating limits as part of the Notification of Compliance Status required under § 63.9(h).
                (d) If you are revising the inspection and maintenance procedures in your OM&M plan, you do not need to conduct a new performance test.

                § 63.8435
                By what date must I conduct performance tests?
                For each affected kiln that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct performance tests within 180 calendar days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.8395 and according to the provisions in § 63.7(a)(2).
              
              
                § 63.8440
                When must I conduct subsequent performance tests?
                (a) For each affected kiln that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct a performance test before renewing your 40 CFR part 70 operating permit or at least every 5 years following the initial performance test.
                (b) You must conduct a performance test when you want to change the parameter value for any operating limit specified in your OM&M plan.
              
              
                § 63.8445
                How do I conduct performance tests and establish operating limits?
                (a) You must conduct each performance test in Table 4 to this subpart that applies to you.
                (b) Before conducting the performance test, you must install and calibrate all monitoring equipment.

                (d) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to you based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
                (e) You must conduct at least three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in § 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must last at least 1 hour.
                (f) You must use the data gathered during the performance test and the equations in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section to determine compliance with the emission limitations.
                (1) To determine compliance with the production-based particulate matter (PM) and mercury (Hg) emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, you must calculate your mass emissions per unit of production for each test run using Equation 1:
                
                  ER26OC15.014

            Subpart KKKKK—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Clay Ceramics Manufacturing
            
              Source:
              80 FR 65543, Oct. 26, 2015, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              What This Subpart Covers
              
                § 63.8530
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes national emission limitations and work practice standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from clay ceramics manufacturing facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations and work practice standards.
              
              
                § 63.8535
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a clay ceramics manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of a major source of HAP emissions according to the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

                (a) A clay ceramics manufacturing facility is a plant site that manufactures pressed floor tile, pressed wall tile, other pressed tile, or sanitaryware (e.g., sinks and toilets). Clay ceramics manufacturing facilities typically process clay, shale, and various additives; form the processed materials into tile or sanitaryware shapes; and dry and fire the ceramic products. Glazes are applied to many tile and sanitaryware products. A plant site that manufactures refractory products, as defined in § 63.9824, or brick and structural clay products (BSCP), as defined in § 63.8515, is not a clay ceramics manufacturing facility.
                (b) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
              
              
                § 63.8540
                What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
                (a) This subpart applies to each existing, new, or reconstructed affected source at a clay ceramics manufacturing facility.
                (b) Each existing, new, or reconstructed ceramic tile roller kiln, sanitaryware tunnel kiln, sanitaryware shuttle kiln, ceramic tile glaze line using glaze spraying, sanitaryware glaze spray booth, ceramic tile spray dryer, and floor tile press dryer is an affected source.
                (c) Process units not subject to the requirements of this subpart are listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section.
                (1) Tunnel, roller or shuttle kilns that are used exclusively for refiring.
                (2) Tunnel, roller or shuttle kilns that are used exclusively for setting glazes on previously fired products.
                (3) Glaze spray operations that are used exclusively with those kilns listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
                (4) Process units listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section that are permitted to, but do not, process first-fire ware, until such time as they begin to process first-fire ware.
                (5) Glaze spray operations that on average use wet glazes containing less than 0.1 (weight) percent metal HAP (dry weight basis) per spray booth over an entire calendar year.
                (6) Raw material processing and handling.
                (7) Wall tile press dryers.
                (8) Sanitaryware ware dryers.
                (9) Sources covered by subparts JJJJJ and SSSSS of this part.
                (d) A source is a new affected source if construction of the affected source began after December 18, 2014, and you met the applicability criteria at the time you began construction.
                (e) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as defined in § 63.2.
                (f) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.
              
              
                § 63.8545
                When do I have to comply with this subpart?

                (a) You must comply with this subpart no later than the compliance dates in Table 8 to this subpart.
                
                (b) You must meet the notification requirements in § 63.8630 according to the schedule in § 63.8630 and in subpart A of this part. Some of the notifications must be submitted before you are required to comply with the emission limitations in this subpart.
              
            
            
              Emission Limitations and Work Practice Standards
              
                § 63.8555

                (c) You must meet each work practice standard in Table 3 to this subpart that applies to you.
              
              
                § 63.8560
                What are my options for meeting the emission limitations and work practice standards?
                (a) To meet the emission limitations in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart, you must use one or more of the options listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
                (1) Emissions control system. Use an emissions capture and collection system and an air pollution control device (APCD) and demonstrate that the resulting emissions meet the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, and that the capture and collection system and APCD meet the applicable operating limits in Table 2 to this subpart.
                (2) Process changes. Use low-HAP raw materials or implement manufacturing process changes and demonstrate that the resulting emissions or emissions reductions meet the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart.
                (b) To meet the work practice standards for affected sanitaryware shuttle kilns, you must comply with the requirements listed in Table 3 to this subpart.
                (c) To meet the work practice standards for affected sources during periods of startup and shutdown, you must comply with the requirements listed in Table 3 to this subpart.
              
            
            
              General Compliance Requirements
              
                § 63.8570
                What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
                (a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations (including operating limits) in this subpart at all times, except during periods that you are approved for and in compliance with the alternative standard for routine control device maintenance as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and except during periods of start-up and shutdown, at which time you must comply with the applicable work practice standard specified in Table 3 to this subpart.

                (b) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source. During the period between the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.8545 and the date upon which continuous monitoring systems (CMS) (e.g., continuous parameter monitoring systems) have been installed and verified and any applicable operating limits have been set, you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the process and emissions control equipment.
                (c) For each affected source that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must prepare and implement a written operation, maintenance, and monitoring (OM&M) plan according to the requirements in § 63.8575.

                (d) If you own or operate an affected source that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart and must perform routine maintenance on the control device for that affected source, you may bypass the source control device and continue operating the affected source subject to the alternative standard established in this paragraph upon approval by the Administrator and provided you satisfy the conditions listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.
                (1) You must request to use the routine control device maintenance alternative standard from the Administrator no later than 120 calendar days before the compliance date specified in § 63.8545. Your request must justify the need for the routine maintenance on the control device and the time required to accomplish the maintenance activities, describe the maintenance activities and the frequency of the maintenance activities, explain why the maintenance cannot be accomplished during source shutdowns, provide information stating whether the continued operation of the affected source will result in fewer emissions than shutting the source down while the maintenance is performed, describe how you plan to comply with paragraph (b) of this section during the maintenance, and provide any other documentation required by the Administrator.
                (2) The routine control device maintenance must not exceed 4 percent of the annual operating uptime for each affected source.
                (3) The request for the routine control device maintenance alternative standard, if approved by the Administrator, must be incorporated by reference in and attached to the affected source's title V permit.
                (4) You must minimize HAP emissions during the period when the affected source is operating and the control device is offline by complying with the applicable standard in Table 3 to this subpart.
                (5) You must minimize the time period during which the affected source is operating and the control device is offline.
                (e) If you own or operate an affected kiln that is subject to the work practice standard specified in Table 3 to this subpart, you must be in compliance with that work practice standard at all times, except during periods of natural gas curtailment or other periods when natural gas is not available.
                (f) You must be in compliance with the provisions of subpart A of this part, except as noted in Table 9 to this subpart.
              
              
                § 63.8575
                What do I need to know about operation, maintenance, and monitoring plans?
                (a) For each affected source that is subject to the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart, you must prepare, implement, and revise as necessary an OM&M plan that includes the information in paragraph (b) of this section. Your OM&M plan must be available for inspection by the delegated authority upon request.
                (b) Your OM&M plan must include, as a minimum, the information in paragraphs (b)(1) through (13) of this section.
                (1) Each process and APCD to be monitored, the type of monitoring device that will be used, and the operating parameters that will be monitored.

              Continuous Compliance Requirements
              
                § 63.8615
                How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
                (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
                (b) Except for periods of monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and routine control device maintenance as specified in § 63.8570(d) when the affected source is operating.
                (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities for purposes of calculating data averages. You must use all the valid data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance. Any averaging period for which you do not have valid monitoring data and such data are required constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
              
              
                § 63.8620

              What This Subpart Covers
              
                § 63.8680
                What is the purpose of this subpart?
                This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for existing and new asphalt processing and asphalt roofing manufacturing facilities. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations.
              
              
                § 63.8681
                Am I subject to this subpart?
                (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an asphalt processing facility or an asphalt roofing manufacturing facility, as defined in § 63.8698, that is a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions, or is located at, or is part of a major source of HAP emissions.
                (b) After the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.8683, blowing stills, asphalt storage tanks, saturators, wet loopers, and coaters subject to the provisions of this subpart that are also subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart UU, are required to comply only with provisions of this subpart.
                (c) This subpart does not apply to any equipment that is subject to subpart CC of this part or to subpart K, Ka, or Kb of 40 CFR part 60.
                (d) This subpart does not apply to asphalt processing and asphalt roofing manufacturing equipment used for research and development, as defined in § 63.8698.
                (e) The provisions of subpart J of 40 CFR part 60 do not apply to emissions from asphalt processing facilities subject to this subpart.
                (f) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.

                § 63.8682
                What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
                (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source at asphalt processing and asphalt roofing manufacturing facilities.
                (b) The affected source is:
                (1) Each asphalt processing facility as defined in § 63.8698; or
                (2) Each asphalt roofing manufacturing line as defined in § 63.8698.
                (i) If the asphalt roofing manufacturing line is collocated with an asphalt processing facility, the storage tanks that store asphalt flux intended for oxidation in the blowing stills and those tanks that receive asphalt directly from the on-site blowing stills are part of the asphalt processing facility. The remaining asphalt storage tanks are considered to be part of the asphalt roofing facility.
                (ii) If an asphalt storage tank is shared by two or more lines at an asphalt roofing manufacturing facility, the shared storage tank is considered part of the line to which the tank supplies the greatest amount of asphalt, on an annual basis.
                (iii) If a sealant or adhesive applicator is shared by two or more asphalt roofing manufacturing lines, the shared applicator is considered part of the line that provides the greatest throughput to the applicator, on an annual basis.
                (c) An affected source is a new affected source if you commenced construction of the affected source after November 21, 2001, and you met the applicability criteria at the time you commenced construction.
                (d) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria in the reconstruction definition in § 63.2.
                (e) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.

                § 63.8698
                What definitions apply to this subpart?
                Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 40 CFR 63.2, the General Provisions of this part, and in this section as follows:
                
                  Adhesive applicator means the equipment used to apply adhesive to roofing shingles for producing laminated or dimensional roofing shingles.
                
                  Asphalt flux means the organic residual material from distillation of crude oil that is generally used in asphalt roofing manufacturing and paving and non-paving asphalt products.
                
                  Asphalt loading rack means the equipment at an asphalt processing facility used to transfer oxidized asphalt from a storage tank into a tank truck, rail car, or barge.
                
                  Asphalt processing facility means any facility engaged in the preparation of asphalt flux at stand-alone asphalt processing facilities, petroleum refineries, and asphalt roofing facilities. Asphalt preparation, called “blowing,” is the oxidation of asphalt flux, achieved by bubbling air through the heated asphalt, to raise the softening point and to reduce penetration of the oxidized asphalt. An asphalt processing facility includes one or more asphalt flux blowing stills, asphalt flux storage tanks storing asphalt flux intended for processing in the blowing stills, oxidized asphalt storage tanks, and oxidized asphalt loading racks.
                
                  Asphalt roofing manufacturing facility means a facility consisting of one or more asphalt roofing manufacturing lines.
                
                  Asphalt roofing manufacturing line means the collection of equipment used to manufacture asphalt roofing products through a series of sequential process steps. The equipment that comprises an asphalt roofing manufacturing line varies depending on the type of substrate used (i.e., organic or inorganic) and the final product manufactured (e.g., roll roofing, laminated shingles). For example, an asphalt roofing manufacturing line that uses fiberglass mat as a substrate typically would not include a saturator/wet looper (or the saturator/wet looper could be bypassed if the line manufacturers multiple types of products). An asphalt roofing manufacturing line can include a saturator (including wet looper), coater, coating mixers, sealant applicators, adhesive applicators, and asphalt storage and process tanks. The number of asphalt roofing manufacturing lines at a particular facility is determined by the number of saturators (or coaters) operated in parallel. For example, an asphalt roofing manufacturing facility with two saturators (or coaters) operating in parallel would be considered to have two separate roofing manufacturing lines.
                
                  Asphalt storage tank means any tank used to store asphalt flux, oxidized asphalt, and modified asphalt, at asphalt roofing manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and asphalt processing facilities. Storage tanks containing cutback asphalts (asphalts diluted with solvents to reduce viscosity for low temperature applications) and emulsified asphalts (asphalts dispersed in water with an emulsifying agent) are not subject to this subpart.
                
                  Blowing still means the equipment in which air is blown through asphalt flux to change the softening point and penetration rate of the asphalt flux, creating oxidized asphalt.
                
                  Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator.
                
                  Coater means the equipment used to apply amended (filled or modified) asphalt to the top and bottom of the substrate (typically fiberglass mat) used to manufacture shingles and rolled roofing products.
                
                  Coating mixer means the equipment used to mix coating asphalt and a mineral stabilizer, prior to applying the stabilized coating asphalt to the substrate.
                
                  Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment such as a flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler used for the combustion of organic hazardous air pollutant vapors.
                
                  Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
                (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart including, but not limited to, any emission limitation (including any operating limit), or work practice standard;
                (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart, and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or
                (3) Fails to meet any emission limitation (including any operating limit) or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.
                
                  Emission limitation means any emission limit, opacity limit, operating limit, or visible emission limit.
                
                  Group 1 asphalt loading rack means an asphalt loading rack that loads asphalt with a maximum temperature of 260 °C (500 °F) or greater and has a maximum true vapor pressure of 10.4 kiloPascals (kPa) (1.5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia)) or greater.
                
                  Group 2 asphalt loading rack means an asphalt loading rack that is not a Group 1 asphalt loading rack.

                  Group 2 asphalt storage tank means any asphalt storage tank with a capacity of 1.93 megagrams (Mg) of asphalt or greater that is not a Group 1 asphalt storage tank.
                
                  Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds. Auxiliary fuel may be used to heat waste gas to combustion temperatures. Any energy recovery section present is not physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit with the combustion section; rather, the energy recovery section is a separate section following the combustion section and the two are joined by ducts or connections carrying flue gas.
                
                  Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure exerted by the stored asphalt at its maximum storage temperature.
                
                  Modified asphalt means asphalt that has been mixed with polymer modifiers.
                
                  Oxidized asphalt means asphalt that has been prepared by passing air through liquid asphalt flux in a blowing still.

                § 63.8802
                What methods must I use to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitation for loop slitter adhesive use?
                (a) Determine the HAP content for each material used. To determine the HAP content for each material used in your foam fabrication operations, you must use one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. If you use the option in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, you are subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
                (1) Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63). You may use Method 311 for determining the mass fraction of HAP. Use the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when determining HAP content by Method 311.
                (i) Include in the HAP total each HAP that is measured to be present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is measured to be 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not need to include it in the HAP total. Express the mass fraction of each HAP you measure as a value truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1234).
                (ii) Calculate the total HAP content in the test material by adding up the individual HAP contents and truncating the result to three places after the decimal point (for example, 0.123).
                (2) Alternative method. You may use an alternative test method for determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You must follow the procedure in § 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test method for approval.
                (3) Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. You may rely on information other than that generated by the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section to determine the mass fraction of HAP according to paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. This information may include, but is not limited to, a material safety data sheet (MSDS), a certified product data sheet (CPDS), or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet.
                (i) Include in the HAP total each HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is 0.5 percent of the material by mass, you do not have to include it in the HAP total.
                (ii) If the HAP content is provided by the material supplier or manufacturer as a range, then you must use the upper limit of the range for determining compliance.
                (4) Verification of supplier or manufacturer information. Although you are not required to perform testing to verify the information obtained according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Administrator may require a separate measurement of the total HAP content using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section. If this measurement exceeds the total HAP content provided by the material supplier or manufacturer, then you must use the measured HAP content to determine compliance.
