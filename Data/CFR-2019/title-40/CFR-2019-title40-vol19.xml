      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(i) That the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent, and</P>
              <P>(ii) That the violation was caused by an act in violation of law (other than the Act or this part), or an act of sabotage, vandalism, or deliberate commingling of gasoline which is produced with the use of lead additives or phosphorus additives with unleaded gasoline, whether or not such acts are violations of law in the jurisdiction where the violation of the requirements of this part occurred, or</P>
              <P>(iii) That the violation was caused by the action of a reseller or a retailer supplied by such reseller, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such reseller designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or</P>
              <P>(iv) That the violation was caused by the action of a retailer who is supplied directly by the refiner (and not by a reseller), in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such retailer designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or</P>
              <P>(v) That the violation was caused by the action of a distributor subject to a contract with the refiner for transportation of gasoline from a terminal to a distributor, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such distributor designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or</P>
              <P>(vi) That the violation was caused by a distributor (such as a common carrier) not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by him for transportation of gasoline from a terminal to a distributor, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as specification or inspection of equipment) to prevent such action, or</P>

              <P>(vii) That the violation occurred at a wholesale purchaser-consumer facility: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if such wholesale purchaser-consumer was supplied by a reseller, the refiner must demonstrate that the violation could not have been prevented by such reseller's compliance with a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such reseller as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(d) In any case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer and any gasoline distributor would be in violation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the distributor will not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate that the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent.</P>

              <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, “testing exemption” means an exemption from the requirements of § 80.27(a) that is granted by the Administrator for the purpose of research or emissions certification.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) In order for a testing exemption to be granted, the applicant must demonstrate the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The proposed test program has a purpose that constitutes an appropriate basis for exemption;</P>
              <P>(B) The proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption;</P>
              <P>(C) The proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; and</P>
              <P>(D) The proposed test program exhibits a degree of control consistent with the purpose of the program and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) monitoring requirements.</P>
              <P>(ii) Paragraphs (e)(3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each of the four elements in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) An appropriate purpose is limited to research or emissions certification. The testing exemption application must include a concise statement of the purpose(s) of the testing program.</P>
              <P>(4) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, the applicant must demonstrate an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner, during a period of the year in which the volatility regulations do not apply, or without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited activities under § 80.27(a). If any site of the proposed test program is located in an area that has been classified by the Administrator as a nonattainment area for purposes of the ozone national ambient air quality standard, the application must also demonstrate an inability to perform the test program in an area that is not so classified.</P>

              <P>(5) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length, effect a reasonable number of vehicles or engines, and utilize a reasonable amount of high <PRTPAGE P="28"/>volatility fuel. In this regard, the testing exemption application must include:</P>
              <P>(i) An estimate of the program's duration;</P>
              <P>(ii) An estimate of the maximum number of vehicles or engines involved in the test program;</P>
              <P>(iii) The time or mileage duration of the test program;</P>
              <P>(iv) The range of volatility of the fuel (expressed in Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP)) expected to be used in the test program; and</P>
              <P>(v) The quantity of fuel which exceeds the applicable standard that is expected to be used in the test program.</P>
              <P>(6) With respect to control, a test program must be capable of affording EPA a monitoring capability. At a minimum, the testing exemption application must also include:</P>
              <P>(i) The technical nature of the test program;</P>
              <P>(ii) The site(s) of the test program (including the street address, city, county, State, and zip code);</P>
              <P>(iii) The manner in which information on vehicles and engines used in the test program will be recorded and made available to the Administrator;</P>
              <P>(iv) The manner in which results of the test program will be recorded and made available to the Administrator;</P>
              <P>(v) The manner in which information on the fuel used in the test program (including RVP level(s), name, address, telephone number, and contact person of supplier, quantity, date received from the supplier) will be recorded and made available to the Administrator;</P>
              <P>(vi) The manner in which the distribution pumps will be labeled to insure proper use of the test fuel;</P>
              <P>(vii) The name, address, telephone number and title of the person(s) in the organization requesting a testing exemption from whom further information on the request may be obtained; and</P>
              <P>(viii) The name, address, telephone number and title of the person(s) in the organization requesting a testing exemption who will be responsible for recording and making available to the Administrator the information specified in paragraphs (e)(6)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section, and the location in which such information will be maintained.</P>
              <P>(7) A testing exemption will be granted by the Administrator upon a demonstration that the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section have been met. The testing exemption will be granted in the form of a memorandum of exemption signed by the applicant and the Administrator (or his delegate), which shall include such terms and conditions as the Administrator determines necessary to monitor the exemption and to carry out the purposes of this section. Any violation of such a term or condition shall cause the exemption to be void.</P>

              <P>(iv) In paragraphs (g)(4)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section, the term “was caused” means that the refiner must demonstrate by reasonably specific showings, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.</P>
              <P>(5) In any case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer would be in violation under paragraphs (e)(1) or (f)(1) of this section, the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate that the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent.</P>

              <P>(8) In addition to the defenses provided in paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section, in any case in which an ethanol blender, distributor, reseller, carrier, retailer, or wholesale purchaser-consumer would be in violation under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as a result of gasoline which contains between 9 and 15 percent ethanol (by volume) but exceeds the applicable standard by more than one pound per square inch (1.0 psi), the ethanol blender, distributor, reseller, carrier, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall not be deemed in violation if such person can demonstrate, by showing receipt of a certification from the facility from which the gasoline was received or other evidence acceptable to the Administrator, that:</P>
              <P>(i) The gasoline portion of the blend complies with the Reid vapor pressure limitations of § 80.27(a); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The ethanol portion of the blend does not exceed 15 percent (by volume); and</P>
              <P>(iii) No additional alcohol or other additive has been added to increase the Reid vapor pressure of the ethanol portion of the blend.</P>

              <FP>In the case of a violation alleged against an ethanol blender, distributor, reseller, or carrier, if the demonstration required by paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section is made by a certification, it must be supported by evidence that the criteria in paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section have been met, such as an oversight program conducted by or on behalf of the ethanol blender, distributor, reseller or carrier alleged to be in violation, which includes periodic sampling and testing of the gasoline or <PRTPAGE P="32"/>monitoring the volatility and ethanol content of the gasoline. Such certification shall be deemed sufficient evidence of compliance provided it is not contradicted by specific evidence, such as testing results, and provided that the party has no other reasonable basis to believe that the facts stated in the certification are inaccurate. In the case of a violation alleged against a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility, such certification shall be deemed an adequate defense for the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, provided that the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer is able to show certificates for all of the gasoline contained in the storage tank found in violation, and, provided that the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer has no reasonable basis to believe that the facts stated in the certifications are inaccurate.</FP>

              <P>(a) After January 1, 1998 every retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer handling over 1,215,000 standard cubic feet of natural gas per month shall equip each pump from which natural gas is introduced into natural gas motor vehicles with a nozzle and hose configuration which vents no more than 1.2 grams of natural gas to the atmosphere per refueling of a vehicle complying with § 86.098-8(d)(1)(iv) of this chapter, as determined by calculation of the geometric shape of the nozzle and hose. After January 1, 2000 this requirement applies to every natural gas retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer. Any dispensing pump shown to be dedicated to heavy-duty vehicles is exempt from this requirement.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section can be waived for refueling stations which were in operation on or before January 1, 1998 provided the station operator can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that compliance with paragraph (a) of this section would require additional compression equipment or other modifications with costs similar to or greater than the cost of additional compression equipment.</P>

              <P>(a) Gasoline that complies with one of the standards specified in § 80.41 (a) through (f) that is relevant for the gasoline, and that meets all other relevant requirements prescribed under § 80.41, shall be deemed certified.</P>
              <P>(b) Any refiner or importer may, with regard to a specific fuel formulation, request from the Administrator a certification that the formulation meets one of the standards specified in § 80.41 (a) through (f).</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Adjusted VOC gasoline for purposes of the general requirements in 80.65(d)(2)(ii), and the certification procedures in this section is gasoline that contains 10 to 15 volume percent ethanol, or RBOB intended for blending with 10 to 15 volume percent ethanol, that is intended for use in the areas described at 80.70(f) and (i), and is designated by the refiner as adjusted VOC gasoline subject to less stringent VOC standards in 80.41(e) and (f). In order for adjusted VOC gasoline to qualify for the regulatory treatment specified in 80.41(e) and (f), reformulated gasoline must contain denatured, anhydrous ethanol. The concentration of the ethanol, excluding the required denaturing agent, must be at least 9 percent and no more than 15 percent (by volume) of the gasoline. The ethanol content of the gasoline shall be determined by use of one of the testing methodologies specified in 80.46(g).</P>
              <P>(2) Refiners may choose not to designate as adjusted VOC gasoline or RBOB that otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in which case the more stringent VOC standards in § 80.41 apply.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of § 80.78(a)(1)(v), the “Adjusted VOC gasoline” standards under § 80.41 are the applicable VOC emissions performance standards only for adjusted VOC gasoline that is intended for use in or sold for use by an ultimate consumer in the covered areas described at § 80.70(f) and (i). For purposes of § 80.78(a)(1)(v), gasoline designated as adjusted VOC gasoline that is intended for use or that is sold for use by an ultimate consumer in any covered area in VOC-Control Region 2 other than those described at § 80.70(f) and (i), is subject to the VOC performance standards in § 80.41 applicable to all other gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 2.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Performance-based Analytical Test Method Approach.</SUBJECT>
              <P>All sample handling, testing procedures, and tests must be conducted using good laboratory practices.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this subpart D:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Performance-based Analytical Test Method Approach</E> means a measurement system based upon established performance criteria for accuracy and precision with use of analytical test methods. As used in this subpart, this is a measurement system used by laboratories to demonstrate that a particular analytical test method is acceptable for demonstrating compliance.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Accuracy</E> means the closeness of agreement between an observed value from a single test measurement and an accepted reference value.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Precision</E> means the degree of agreement in a set of measurements performed on the same property of identical test material.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Absolute fuel parameter</E> means a fuel parameter for which a gravimetric standard is practical to construct and use. Sulfur content of gasoline, butane, or diesel fuel are examples of an absolute fuel parameter.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Gravimetric standard</E> means a test material made by adding a carefully weighed quantity of the analyte to a measured quantity of another substance known not to contain any of the analyte, resulting in a solution with an accurately known concentrate of the analyte.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Consensus named fuels</E> are homogeneous quantities of fuel that have been analyzed by a number of different laboratories (by sending around small samples). The average concentration of some parameter of interest across all of the different laboratories is then used as the “consensus name” for that material.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Locally-named reference materials</E> are gasoline or diesel fuels that are usually from the regular production of the facility where they are used in laboratory quality control efforts and have been analyzed using the designated method (either by the facility's lab or by a reference lab) to obtain an estimate of their concentration.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Method-defined fuel parameter</E> means a fuel parameter for which an <PRTPAGE P="61"/>EPA-prescribed primary test method or designated method defines the regulatory standard. Examples of method-defined fuel parameters include olefin content in gasoline, Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of gasoline, distillation parameters of gasoline, benzene content of gasoline, aromatic content of gasoline and diesel fuel, and oxygen/oxygenates content of gasoline.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Reference installations</E> are designated test method installations that are used to qualify the accuracy of other method-defined parameter instruments. Reference installations of the designated test method will be used to evaluate the accuracy of other method-defined alternative test methods and to establish correlation equations if necessary.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Correlation equation</E> is a correction equation as determined by the use of ASTM D6708. This standard practice determines whether the comparison between the alternative test method and the designated test method is a null result. If the comparison is not null, then the standard practice provides for a correlation equation that predicts designated test method results from the applicable method-defined alternative test method.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Statistical quality control (SQC)</E> means a planned system of activities whose purpose is to provide a level of quality that meets the needs of compliance with the standards of this part. This subpart prescribes specific SQC requirements for both absolute and method driven fuel parameters for both voluntary and non-voluntary consensus-based standards bodies.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Voluntary consensus-based standards body (VCSB)</E> means a domestic or international organization that plans, develops, establishes, or coordinates voluntary consensus standards using agreed-upon procedures and which possesses the attributes of openness, balance of interest, due process, and consensus, as explained in OMB Circular A-119 and the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995, P.L. 104-113, sec. 12(d).</P>
              <P>(13) <E T="03">Non-voluntary consensus-based standards body (non-VCSB)</E> means a domestic or international regulated party that has developed a proprietary analytical test method that has not been adopted by a VCSB organization.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 80.48</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Augmentation of the complex emission model by vehicle testing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of this section apply only if a fuel claims emission reduction benefits from fuel parameters that are not included in the complex emission model or complex emission model database, or if the values of fuel parameters included in the complex emission model set forth in § 80.45 fall outside the range of values for which the complex emission model is deemed valid.</P>
              <P>(b) To augment the complex emission model described at § 80.45, the following requirements apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The petitioner must obtain prior approval from the Administrator for the design of the test program before beginning the vehicle testing process. To obtain approval, the petitioner must at minimum provide the following information: the fuel parameter to be evaluated for emission effects; the number and description of vehicles to be used in the test fleet, including model year, model name, vehicle identification number (VIN), mileage, emission performance (exhaust THC emission level), technology type, and manufacturer; a description of the methods used to procure and prepare the vehicles; the properties of the fuels to be used in the testing program (as specified at § 80.49); the pollutants and emission categories intended to be evaluated; the precautions used to ensure that the effects of the parameter in question are independent of the effects of other parameters already included in the model; a description of the quality assurance procedures to be used during the test program; the statistical analysis techniques to be used in analyzing the test data, and the identity and location of the organization performing the testing.</P>
              <P>(2) Exhaust emissions shall be measured per the requirements of this section and § 80.49 through § 80.62.</P>
              <P>(3) The nonexhaust emission model (including evaporative, running loss, and refueling VOC and toxics emissions) shall not be augmented by vehicle testing.</P>
              <P>(4) The Agency reserves the right to observe and monitor any testing that is performed pursuant to the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The Agency reserves the right to evaluate the quality and suitability of data submitted pursuant to the requirements of this section and to reject, re-analyze, or otherwise evaluate such data as is technically warranted.</P>

              <P>(6) Upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator, the Administrator <PRTPAGE P="73"/>may approve a petition to waive the requirements of this section and § 80.49, § 80.50(a), § 80.60(d)(3), and § 80.60(d)(4) in order to better optimize the test program to the needs of the particular fuel parameter. Any such waiver petition should provide information justifying the requested waiver, including an acceptable rationale and supporting data. Petitioners must obtain approval from the Administrator prior to conducting testing for which the requirements in question are waived. The Administrator may waive the noted requirements in whole or in part, and may impose appropriate conditions on any such waiver.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of petitions to augment the complex model defined at § 80.45 with a new parameter, the effect of the parameter being tested shall be determined separately, for each pollutant and for each emitter class category. If the parameter is not included in the complex model but is represented in whole or in part by one or more parameters included in the model, the petitioner shall be required to demonstrate the emission effects of the parameter in question independent of the effects of the already-included parameters. The petitioner shall also have to demonstrate the effects of the already-included parameters independent of the effects of the parameter in question. The emission performance of each vehicle on the fuels specified at § 80.49, as measured through vehicle testing in accordance with § 80.50 through § 80.62, shall be analyzed to determine the effects of the fuel parameter being tested on emissions according to the following procedure:</P>
              <P>(1) The analysis shall fit a regression model to the natural logarithm of emissions measured from addition fuels 1, 2, and 3 only (as specified at § 80.49(a) and adjusted as per paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section and § 80.49(d)) that includes the following terms:</P>

              <P>(i) A term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form D<E T="52">i</E> × V<E T="52">i</E>, where D<E T="52">i</E> is the coefficient for the term and V<E T="52">i</E> is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles.</P>

              <P>(ii) A linear term in the parameter being tested for each emitter class, of the form A<E T="52">i</E> × (P<E T="52">1</E>−P<E T="52">1</E> (avg)) × E<E T="52">i</E>, where A<E T="52">i</E> is the coefficient for the term, P<E T="52">1</E> is the level of the parameter in question, P<E T="52">1</E> (avg) is the average level of the parameter in question for all seven test fuels specified at § 80.49(a)(1), and E<E T="52">i</E> is a dummy variable representing emitter class, as defined at § 80.62. For normal emitters, E<E T="52">1</E> = 1 and E<E T="52">2</E> = 0. For higher emitters, E<E T="52">1</E> = 0 and E<E T="52">2</E> = 1.</P>
              <P>(iii) For the VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E> models, a squared term in the parameter being tested for each emitter class, of the form B<E T="52">i</E> × (P<E T="52">1</E>−P<E T="52">1</E> (avg))<SU>2</SU> × E<E T="52">i</E>, where B<E T="52">i</E> is the coefficient for the term and where P<E T="52">1</E> , P<E T="52">1</E> (avg), and E<E T="52">i</E> are as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) To the extent that the properties of fuels 1, 2, and 3 which are incorporated in the complex model differ in value among the three fuels, the complex model shall be used to adjust the observed emissions from test vehicles on those fuels to compensate for those differences prior to fitting the regression model.</P>
              <P>(v) The A<E T="52">i</E> and B<E T="52">i</E> terms and coefficients developed by the regression described in this paragraph (c) shall be evaluated against the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section. If both terms satisfy these criteria, then both terms shall be retained. If the B<E T="52">i</E> term satisfies these criteria and the A<E T="52">i</E> term does not, then both terms shall be retained. If the B<E T="52">i</E> term does not satisfy these criteria, then the B<E T="52">i</E> term shall be dropped from the regression model and the model shall be re-estimated. If, after dropping the B<E T="52">i</E> term and re-estimating the model, the A<E T="52">i</E> term does not satisfy these criteria, then both terms shall be dropped, all test data shall be reported to EPA, and the augmentation request shall be denied.</P>

              <P>(2) After completing the steps outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the analysis shall fit a regression model to a combined data set that includes vehicle testing results from all seven addition fuels specified at § 80.49(a), the vehicle testing results used to develop the model specified at § 80.45, and vehicle testing results used <PRTPAGE P="74"/>to support any prior augmentation requests which the Administrator deems necessary.</P>
              <P>(i) The analysis shall fit the regression models described in paragraphs (c)(2) (ii) through (v) of this section to the natural logarithm of measured emissions.</P>

              <P>(ii) All regressions shall include a term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form D<E T="52">i</E> × V<E T="52">i</E>, where D<E T="52">i</E> is the coefficient for the term and V<E T="52">i</E> is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles. Vehicles shall be represented by separate terms for each test program in which they were tested. The vehicle terms for the vehicles included in the test program undertaken by the petitioner shall be calculated based on the results from all seven fuels specified at § 80.49(a). Note that the D<E T="52">i</E> estimates for the petitioner's test vehicles in this regression are likely to differ from the D<E T="52">i</E> estimates discussed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section since they will be based on a different set of fuels.</P>
              <P>(iii) All regressions shall include existing complex model terms and their coefficients, including those augmentations that the Administrator deems necessary. All terms and coefficients shall be expressed in centered form. The Administrator shall make available upon request existing complex model terms and coefficients in centered form.</P>
              <P>(iv) All regressions shall include the linear and squared terms, and their coefficients, estimated in the final regression model described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) The VOC and NO<E T="52">X</E> regressions shall include those interactive terms with other fuel parameters, of the form C<E T="52">i(1, j)</E> × (P<E T="52">1</E> − P<E T="52">1</E> (avg)) × (P<E T="52">j</E> − P<E T="52">j</E> (avg)) × E<E T="52">i</E>, where C<E T="52">i(1, j)</E> is the coefficient for the term, P<E T="52">1</E> is the level of the parameter being added to the model, P<E T="52">1</E> (avg) is the average level of the parameter being added for all seven addition fuels specified at § 80.49(a), P<E T="52">j</E> is the level of the other fuel parameter, P<E T="52">j</E> (avg) is the centering value for the other fuel parameter used to develop the complex model or used in the other parameter's augmentation study, and E<E T="52">i</E> is as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which are found to satisfy the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Such terms shall be added to the regression model in a stepwise manner.</P>
              <P>(3) The model described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section shall be developed separately for normal-emitting and higher-emitting vehicles. Each emitter class shall be treated as a distinct population for the purposes of determining regression coefficients.</P>
              <P>(4) Once the augmented models described in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section have been developed, they shall be converted to an uncentered form through appropriate algebraic manipulation.</P>
              <P>(5) The augmented model described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall be used to determine the effects of the parameter in question at levels between the levels in Fuels 1 and 3, as defined at § 80.49(a)(1), for all fuels which claim emission benefits from the parameter in question.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) In the case of petitions to augment the complex model defined at § 80.45 by extending the range of an existing complex model parameter, the effect of the parameter being tested shall be determined separately, for each pollutant and for each technology group and emitter class category, at levels between the extension level and the nearest limit of the core of the data used to develop the unaugmented complex model as follows:</P>

              <P>(2) The emission performance of each vehicle on the fuels specified at § 80.49(b)(2), as measured through vehicle testing in accordance with §§ 80.50 <PRTPAGE P="75"/>through 80.62, shall be analyzed to determine the effects of the fuel parameter being tested on emissions according to the following procedure:</P>
              <P>(i) The analysis shall incorporate the vehicle testing data from the extension fuels specified at § 80.49(b), the vehicle testing results used to develop the model specified at § 80.45, and vehicle testing results used to support any prior augmentation requests which the Administrator deems necessary. A regression incorporating the following terms shall be fitted to the natural logarithm of emissions contained in this combined data set:</P>

              <P>(A) A term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form D<E T="52">i</E> × V<E T="52">i</E>, where D<E T="52">i</E> is the coefficient for the term and V<E T="52">i</E> is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles. Vehicles shall be represented by separate terms for each test program in which they were tested. The vehicle terms for the vehicles included in the test program undertaken by the petitioner shall be calculated based on the results from all three fuels specified at § 80.49(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(B) Existing complex model terms that do not include the parameter being extended and their coefficients, including those augmentations that the Administrator deems necessary. The centering values for these terms shall be identical to the centering values used to develop the complex model described at § 80.45.</P>
              <P>(C) Existing complex model terms that include the parameter being extended. The coefficients for these terms shall be estimated by the regression. The centering values for these terms shall be identical to the centering values used to develop the complex model described at § 80.45.</P>
              <P>(D) If the unaugmented VOC or NO<E T="52">X</E> complex models do not contain a squared term for the parameter being extended, such a term should be added in a stepwise fashion after completing the model described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. The coefficient for this term shall be estimated by the regression. The centering value for this term shall be identical to the centering value used to develop the complex model described at § 80.45.</P>
              <P>(E) The terms defined in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(C) and (D) of this section shall be evaluated against the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The model described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section shall be developed separately for normal-emitting and higher-emitting vehicles, as defined at § 80.62. Each emitter class shall be treated as a distinct population for the purposes of determining regression coefficients.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Statistical criteria.</E> (1) The petitioner shall be required to submit evidence with the petition which demonstrates the statistical validity of the regression described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, including at minimum:</P>
              <P>(i) Evidence demonstrating that colinearity problems are not severe, including but not limited to variance inflation statistics of less than 10 for the second-order and interactive terms included in the regression model.</P>
              <P>(ii) Evidence demonstrating that the regression residuals are normally distributed, including but not limited to the skewness and Kurtosis statistics for the residuals.</P>

              <P>(iii) Evidence demonstrating that overfitting and underfitting risks have been balanced, including but not limited to the use of Mallow's C<E T="52">p</E> criterion.</P>
              <P>(2) The petitioner shall be required to submit evidence with the petition which demonstrates that the appropriate terms have been included in the regression, including at minimum:</P>
              <P>(i) Descriptions of the analysis methods used to develop the regressions, including any computer code used to analyze emissions data and the results of regression runs used to develop the proposed augmentation, including intermediate regressions produced during the stepwise regression process.</P>
              <P>(ii) Evidence demonstrating that the significance level used to include terms in the model was equal to 0.90.</P>
              <P>(f) The complex emission model shall be augmented with the results of vehicle testing as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) The terms and coefficients determined in paragraph (c) or (d) of this <PRTPAGE P="76"/>section shall be used to supplement the complex emission model equation for the corresponding pollutant and emitter category. These terms and coefficients shall be weighted to reflect the contribution of the emitter category to in-use emissions as shown at § 80.45.</P>
              <P>(2) If the candidate parameter is not included in the unaugmented complex model and is not represented in whole or in part by one or more parameters included in the model, the modification shall be accomplished by adding the terms and coefficients to the complex model equation for that pollutant, technology group, and emitter category.</P>
              <P>(3) If the parameter is included in the complex model but is being tested at levels beyond the current range of the model, the terms and coefficients determined in paragraph (d) of this section shall be used to supplement the complex emission model equation for the corresponding pollutant.</P>
              <P>(i) The terms and coefficients of the complex model described at § 80.45 shall be used to evaluate the emissions performance of fuels with levels of the parameter being tested that are within the valid range of the model, as defined at § 80.45.</P>
              <P>(ii) The emissions performance of fuels with levels of the parameter that are beyond the valid range of the unaugmented model shall be given in percentage change terms by 100 − [(100 + A) × (100 + C) / (100 + B)], where:</P>
              <P>(A) “A” shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions for a fuel with identical fuel property values to the fuel being evaluated except for the parameter being extended, which shall be set equal to the nearest limit of the data core, using the unaugmented complex model.</P>
              <P>(B) “B” shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions for the fuel described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section according to the augmented complex model.</P>
              <P>(C) “C” shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions of the actual fuel being evaluated using the augmented complex model.</P>
              <P>(g) EPA reserves the right to analyze the data generated during vehicle testing, to use such analyses to determine the validity of other augmentation petitions, and to use such data to update the complex model for use in certifying all reformulated gasolines.</P>
              <P>(h) Duration of acceptance of emission effects determined through vehicle testing:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Agency does not accept, modify, or reject a particular augmentation for inclusion in an updated complex model (performed through rulemaking), then the augmentation shall remain in effect until the next update to the complex model takes effect.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Agency does reject or modify a particular augmentation for inclusion in an updated complex model, then the augmentation shall no longer be able to be used as of the date the updated complex model is deemed to take effect, unless the following conditions and limitations apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The augmentation in question may continue to be used by those fuel suppliers which can prove, to the Administrator's satisfaction, that the fuel supplier had already begun producing a fuel utilizing the augmentation at the time the revised model is promulgated.</P>
              <P>(ii) The augmentation in question may only be used to evaluate the emissions performance of fuels in conjunction with the complex emission model in effect as of the date of production of the fuels.</P>
              <P>(iii) The augmentation may only be used for three years of fuel production, or a total of five years from the date the augmentation first took effect, whichever is shorter.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator shall determine when sufficient new information on the effects of fuel properties on vehicle emissions has been obtained to warrant development of an updated complex model.</P>

              <P>(2) The addition fuels shall contain detergent control additives in accordance with section 211(l) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the associated EPA requirements for such additives.</P>
              <P>(3) The addition fuels shall be specified with at least the same level of detail and precision as in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, and this information shall be included in the petition submitted to the Administrator requesting augmentation of the complex emission model.</P>
              <P>(i) Paraffin levels in Fuels 1 and 2 shall be altered from the paraffin level in Fuel 3 to compensate for the addition or removal of the candidate parameter, if necessary. Paraffin levels in Fuel 4 shall be altered from the paraffin level in Fuel 5 to compensate for the addition or removal of the candidate parameter, if necessary. Paraffin levels in Fuel 6 shall be altered from the paraffin level in Fuel 7 to compensate for the addition or removal of the candidate parameter, if necessary.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Measurement methods for benzene and 1,3-butadiene.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Sampling for benzene and 1,3-butadiene must be accomplished by bag sampling as used for total hydrocarbons determination. This procedure is detailed in 40 CFR 86.109.</P>
              <P>(b) Benzene and 1,3-butadiene must be analyzed by gas chromatography. Expected values for benzene and 1,3-butadiene in bag samples for the baseline fuel are 4.0 ppm and 0.30 ppm respectively. At least three standards ranging from at minimum 50% to 150% of these expected values must be used to calibrate the detector. An additional standard of at most 0.01 ppm must also be measured to determine the required limit of quantification as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The sample injection size used in the chromatograph must be sufficient to be above the laboratory determined limit of quantification (LOQ) as defined in paragraph (d) of this section for at least one of the bag samples. A control chart of the measurements of the standards used to determine the response, repeatability, and limit of quantitation of the instrumental method for 1,3-butadiene and benzene must be reported.</P>

              <P>(d) As in all types of sampling and analysis procedures, good laboratory practices must be used. See, Lawrence, Principals of Environmental Analysis, 55 Analytical Chemistry 14, at 2210-2218 (1983) (copies may be obtained from the publisher, American Chemical Society, 1155 16th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036). Reporting reproducibility control charts and limits of detection measurements are integral procedures to assess the validity of the chosen analytical method. The repeatability of the test method must be determined by measuring a standard periodically during testing and recording the measured values on a control chart. The control chart shows the error between the measured standard and the prepared standard concentration for the periodic testing. The error between the measured standard and the actual standard indicates the uncertainty in the analysis. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined by repeatedly measuring a <PRTPAGE P="82"/>blank and a standard prepared at a concentration near an assumed value of the limit of detection. If the average concentration minus the average of the blanks is greater than three standard deviations of these measurements, then the limit of detection is at least as low as the prepared standard. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) is defined as ten times the standard deviation of these measurements. This quantity defines the amount of sample required to be measured for a valid analysis.</P>
              <P>(e) Other sampling and analytical techniques will be allowed if they can be proven to have equal specificity and equal or better limits of quantitation. Data from alternative methods that can be demonstrated to have equivalent or superior limits of detection, precision, and accuracy may be accepted by the Administrator with individual prior approval.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Measurement methods for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde will be measured by drawing exhaust samples from heated lines through either 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) impregnated cartridges or impingers filled with solutions of DNPH in acetonitrile (ACN) as described in §§ 86.109 and 86.140 of this chapter for formaldehyde analysis. Diluted exhaust sample volumes must be at least 15 L for impingers containing 20 ml of absorbing solution (using more absorbing solution in the impinger requires proportionally more gas sample to be taken) and at least 4 L for cartridges. As required in § 86.109 of this chapter, two impingers or cartridges must be connected in series to detect breakthrough of the first impinger or cartridge.</P>
              <P>(b) In addition, sufficient sample must be drawn through the collecting cartridges or impingers so that the measured quantity of aldehyde is sufficiently greater than the minimum limit of quantitation of the test method for at least a portion of the exhaust test procedure. The limit of quantitation is determined using the technique defined in § 80.55(d).</P>
              <P>(c) Each of the impinger samples are quantitatively transferred to a 25 mL volumetric flask (5 mL more than the sample impinger volume) and brought to volume with ACN. The cartridge samples are eluted in reversed direction by gravity feed with 6mL of ACN. The eluate is collected in a graduated test tube and made up to the 5mL mark with ACN. Both the impinger and cartridge samples must be analyzed by HPLC without additional sample preparation.</P>
              <P>(d) The analysis of the aldehyde derivatives collected is accomplished with a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Standards consisting of the hydrazone derivative of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are used to determine the response, repeatability, and limit of quantitation of the HPLC method chosen for acetaldehyde and formaldehyde.</P>
              <P>(e) Other sampling and analytical techniques will be allowed if they can be proven to have equal specificity and equal or better limits of quantitation. Data from alternative methods that can be demonstrated to have equivalent or superior limits of detection, precision, and accuracy may be accepted by the Administrator with individual prior approval.</P>

              <P>(c) Each vehicle in the test fleet shall have no fewer than 4,000 miles of accumulated mileage prior to being included in the test program.</P>

              <P>(b) Candidate vehicles for the test fleet must be screened for their exhaust VOC emissions in accordance with the provisions in § 80.62.</P>
              <P>(c) On the basis of pretesting pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the test fleet shall be subdivided into two emitter group sub-fleets: the normal emitter group and the higher emitter group.</P>
              <P>(1) Each vehicle with an exhaust total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions rate which is less than or equal to twice the applicable emissions standard shall be placed in the normal emitter group.</P>
              <P>(2) Each vehicle with an exhaust THC emissions rate which is greater than two times the applicable emissions standard shall be placed in the higher emitter group.</P>
              <P>(d) The test vehicles in each emitter group must conform to the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Test vehicles for the normal emitter sub-fleet must be selected from the list shown in this paragraph (d)(1). This list is arranged in order of descending vehicle priority, such that the order in which vehicles are added to the normal emitter sub-fleet must conform to the order shown (e.g., a ten-vehicle normal emitter group sub-fleet must consist of the first ten vehicles listed in this paragraph (d)(1)). If more vehicles are tested than the minimum number of vehicles required for the normal emitter sub-fleet, additional vehicles are to be added to the fleet in the order specified in this paragraph (d)(1), beginning with the next vehicle not already included in the group. The vehicles in the normal emitter sub-fleet must possess the characteristics indicated in the list. If the end of the list is reached in adding vehicles to the normal emitter sub-fleet and additional vehicles are desired then they shall be added beginning with vehicle number one, and must be added to the normal emitter sub-fleet in accordance with the order in table A:</P>

              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(3)(i) For each averaging period, and separately for each parameter that may be met either per-gallon or on average, any refiner shall designate for each refinery, or any importer shall designate its gasoline or RBOB as being subject to the standard applicable to that parameter on either a per-gallon or average basis. For any specific averaging period and parameter all batches of gasoline or RBOB shall be designated as being subject to the per-gallon standard, or all batches of gasoline and RBOB shall be designated as being subject to the average standard. For any specific averaging period and parameter a refiner for a refinery, or any importer may not designate certain batches as being subject to the per-gallon standard and others as being subject to the average standard.</P>

              <P>(ii) In the event any refiner for a refinery, or any importer fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section and for a specific averaging period and parameter designates certain batches as being subject to the per-gallon standard and others as being subject to the average, all batches produced or imported during the averaging period that were designated as being subject to the average standard shall, <E T="03">ab initio</E>, be redesignated as being subject to the per-gallon standard. This redesignation shall apply regardless of whether the batches in question met or failed to meet the per-gallon standard for the parameter in question.</P>

              <P>(B) The action of any reseller, distributor, oxygenate blender, carrier, or a retailer or wholesale purchaser- consumer supplied by any of these persons, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner designed to prevent such action, and despite periodic sampling and testing by the refiner to ensure compliance with such contractual obligation; or</P>
              <P>(C) The action of any carrier or other distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by the refiner for transportation of gasoline, despite specification or inspection of procedures and equipment by the refiner which are reasonably calculated to prevent such action.</P>
              <P>(ii) In this paragraph (b), to show that the violation “was caused” by any of the specified actions the party must demonstrate by reasonably specific showings, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.</P>

              <P>(ii) Effective data and publication of decision.</P>

              <P>(A) If the Administrator determines that the petition meets the requirements of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, then EPA shall publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing its intention to establish the non-commingling season as requested by the Governor, and specifying a tentative effective date.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The Administrator shall provide the public with an opportunity for a hearing and the submission of written comments.</P>

              <P>(B) If the Administrator receives adverse comments or information demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the criteria of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section have not been met, that the tentative effective date is not reasonable, or that other good reasons exist to deny the petition, then the Administrator may reject the Governor's request for an extended non-commingling season, in whole or in part, or may delay the effective date by up to two (2) additional years. Absent receipt of such adverse comments or information, EPA shall publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing its approval of the petition and specifying an effective date for the extended non-commingling season.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of any refiner that produces RBOB, or any importer that imports RBOB, the oxygenate that is blended with the RBOB may be included with the refiner's or importer's compliance calculations under paragraph (d) of this section only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The oxygenate meets the applicable renewable oxygenate definition under paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of RBOB designated for “non VOC controlled ether only” the refiner or importer assumes that ETBE or other oxygenate that does not exhibit volatility-related commingling effects when mixed with other gasolines and approved by the EPA Administrator under subparagraph (a)(3) of this section will be blended with the RBOB and so labels the transfer documentation.</P>

              <P>(iv) Transmix blenders who seek an exemption under paragraph (d)(3) of this section must comply with any request by EPA for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption. However, they may withdraw their exemption petition or approved exemption at any time, upon notice to EPA.</P>
              <P>(v) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the transmix blender's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the end-point temperature of the gasoline produced, or if EPA determines that any other circumstance exists which merits modification of the requirements of an exemption. If EPA finds that a transmix blender provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the transmix blender's exemption will be void ab initio.</P>
              <P>(4) In the event the test results for any sample collected pursuant to a quality assurance program indicate the gasoline does not comply with any of the applicable standards in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the transmix blender shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Immediately take steps to stop the sale of the gasoline that was sampled;</P>
              <P>(ii) Take steps which are reasonably calculated to determine the cause of the noncompliance and to prevent future instances of noncompliance;</P>
              <P>(iii) Inform EPA of the noncompliance; and</P>

              <P>(iv) If the transmix was blended by a computer controlled in-line blending system, increase the rate of sampling and testing to a rate of not less than once per week and continue the increased frequency of sampling and testing until the results of ten consecutive <PRTPAGE P="138"/>samples and tests indicate the gasoline complies with applicable standards, at which time the sampling and testing may be conducted at the original frequency;</P>
              <P>(5) Any transmix blender who blends transmix into previously certified gasoline and who does not meet the requirements under this paragraph (d) shall meet all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under subparts D and E of this part, other than this section and §§ 80.74(b)(10), and 80.104(b).</P>
              <P>(e) The provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section also apply to mixtures of gasoline and distillate fuel:</P>

Summer fuel is defined as fuel produced and intended for sale to satisfy Federal summer volatility standards. When such per batch actual RVP data is not available, data is allocated per month as follows. A summer month is defined as any month during which more than 50 percent (by volume) of the gasoline produced by a refiner met the Federal summer gasoline volatility requirements. Winter shall be any month which could not be considered a summer month under this definition.</P>

A refiner may retire credits or allowances purchased under this paragraph (k)(3)(iii) at any time.</P>

              <P>(D) For purposes of satisfying a refinery's obligations under paragraphs (k)(3)(ii)(C), (k)(3)(iii)(A) or (l)(6)(ii) of this section, any NO<E T="52">X</E> credits or allowances that a refiner purchases must have been validly generated as part of a state stationary source program covered by an approved state implementation plan (SIP) and must be current and marketable NO<E T="52">X</E> credits or allowances. It shall be the refiner's responsibility to ensure that NO<E T="52">X</E> credits or allowances are valid, current and marketable.</P>
              <P>(E) In order to be retired, NO<E T="52">X</E> allowances or credits must be retired by EPA or the administering state agency, as provided for in the applicable state implementation plan (SIP). It shall be the refiner's responsibility to ensure that NO<E T="52">X</E> credits or allowances are actually retired and that retirement is reflected in the records of EPA or the administering state agency.</P>

              <P>(iv) (A) The refinery shall not generate marketable credits or allotments under the Tier 2 gasoline program provisions of Subpart H of this part during the entire alternative averaging period and shall provide a written statement, on a quarterly basis, certifying that the refinery has not generated, produced, sold, or transferred any such marketable credits or allotments under Subpart H of this part.<PRTPAGE P="185"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) If the final quarter of the alternative averaging period ends on a date other than December 31, then the refiner may generate credits for that portion of the year that was not subject to the alternative averaging period.</P>

              <P>(vi) A refinery that has been granted an averaging period under this section must submit the following reports to the Administrator within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter:</P>
              <P>(A) Quarterly batch reports and anti-dumping averaging reports for gasoline produced during each quarter; and</P>
              <P>(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) Documents that demonstrate compliance with the requirements under paragraph (k)(3)(iii) and (k)(3)(iv) of this section. including a calculation of the NO<E T="52">X</E> deficit or benefit for that quarter and a current total, based upon all quarters, indicating the current NO<E T="52">X</E> deficit or NO<E T="52">X</E> benefit balance for the refinery; and</P>
              <P>(2) A statement of the number of NO<E T="52">X</E> credits or allowances purchased, sold or retired during the quarter and a current total, based upon all quarters, indicating the current balance of NO<E T="52">X</E> credits or allowances; and</P>

              <P>(vii) The Administrator may specify, as part of the approved petition, deadlines by which a refiner is obligated to take certain actions (including those listed in paragraph (k)(2)(viii) of this section) demonstrating reasonable progress toward completion of the refinery changes necessary to produce gasoline that will allow the refinery to comply with the overall alternative averaging period NO<E T="52">X</E> standard.</P>

              <P>(viii)(A) The refiner shall submit reports demonstrating compliance with deadline requirements under paragraph (k)(3)(vii) of this section no later than 30 days after the applicable deadline occurs. Upon failure to meet a deadline requirement under paragraph (k)(3)(vii) of this section, the Administrator may accelerate the date by which the refiner would have to produce gasoline that complies with the annual average statutory baseline NO<E T="52">X</E> standard under paragraph (k)(3)(i) or (l)(6)(i) of this section such that the gasoline produced by the refinery beginning with the quarter immediately following the quarter during which the failure occurred (and during each subsequent quarter) would have to meet that standard. The acceleration of the requirement under paragraph (k)(3)(i) or (l)(6)(i) of this section, regarding compliance with the annual average statutory baseline NO<E T="52">X</E> standard, does not affect the applicability of any other standard or requirement applicable to the refinery under this or any other section of the Act (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the refinery must still comply with the overall alternative averaging period NO<E T="52">X</E> requirements in paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section).</P>

              <P>(ix) The refiner shall comply with any condition or requirement prescribed by the Administrator as part of the petition approval.</P>

              <P>(x) The refinery must comply with all standards in this paragraph and with all applicable anti-dumping standards in Subpart E of this section, except the NO<E T="52">X</E> standard.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Approval or disapproval of petitions.</E> The Administrator will approve or disapprove the petition within six months of receipt, in writing, and in the case of an approval will include any conditions or requirements to which the approval is subject.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Effective date for alternative averaging period.</E> (i) For an approved petition, the alternative averaging period shall become effective with the first day of the next calendar quarter, unless the first day of a later calendar quarter is requested.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the final quarter of the alternative averaging period ends on a date other than December 31, then the refiner must demonstrate compliance with anti-dumping standards for gasoline produced during the remainder of <PRTPAGE P="186"/>that year and must demonstrate such compliance via the annual report as specified in § 80.105.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Refinery request for a change in alternative averaging period.</E> At any point during the pendency of an alternative conventional gasoline anti-dumping compliance period the Administrator may, upon application by a refiner, approve a different alternative compliance period for a refinery already operating subject to an alternative compliance period. In any such case:</P>
              <P>(i) A refinery for which a change in the applicable alternative compliance period is approved shall thereafter operate as if the refinery had originally requested and received such alternative compliance period, and shall be subject to the standards and other requirements applicable under such alternative compliance period.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator will approve or disapprove any application for a different alternative compliance period, in writing, within six months of receipt, and in the case of an approval will include any conditions or other requirements to which the approval is subject;</P>
              <P>(iii) Accept as specifically modified by this section, such refinery must continue to comply with all other standards and other requirements applicable under the conventional gasoline anti-dumping standards; and</P>
              <P>(iv) No application may result in an alternative compliance period that extends beyond January 1, 2006, except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Violations under this paragraph (k).</E> Any person who fails to meet a standard or other requirement under this paragraph (k) shall be liable for penalties under § 80.5. Additionally, in the event that the refiner fails to achieve the required NO<E T="52">X</E> benefit calculated under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, any NO<E T="52">X</E> credits still banked under paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section shall be forfeit.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Special alternative anti-dumping averaging period provisions for small refineries</E>—(1) <E T="03">Eligibility for petition.</E> A refiner who has been granted small refiner status under § 80.235 and who meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (k)(1) of this section may petition for an alternative compliance period that is greater than five years and/or that extends beyond January 1, 2006, provided that such application is submitted by January 1, 2004. No application under this paragraph (l) may result in an alternative compliance period that extends beyond January 1, 2008.</P>

              <P>(4) Approval or disapproval of petitions. The Administrator may approve <PRTPAGE P="187"/>a petition under this paragraph (l) if it includes information sufficient to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that cost and/or technological constraints make it infeasible for the refinery to comply with an alternative anti-dumping compliance baseline of five years or less, or that ends on or before January 1, 2006. The Administrator will approve or deny the petition in writing within six months of receipt. An approval will include any conditions or requirements to which the approval is subject.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Cessation of extended alternative compliance period.</E> (i) Refineries that qualify as small under § 80.223, and that later are disqualified under § 80.230(b), will be subject to the statutory anti-dumping baseline on an annual average basis beginning the calendar year immediately following the refinery's change in status.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Administrator finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information on its application for small refiner status, upon notice from the Administrator, the refiner's extended alternative compliance period will be void ab initio.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Compliance requirements for qualifying small refiners.</E> (i) If the refiner's application for an extended compliance period under this paragraph (l) is approved, then the refinery must comply with the statutory baseline NO<E T="52">X</E> standard, on average, for gasoline produced beginning by not later than the 19th quarter (for a six year compliance period) or by no later than the 22nd quarter (for a seven year compliance period).</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Detergent registration requirements.</E> To be eligible for use by fuel manufacturers in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, a detergent additive package must be registered by its manufacturer under 40 CFR part 79 according to the specifications in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section. After evaluating the adequacy of registration data provided by the detergent manufacturer pursuant to these requirements, if EPA finds the data to be deficient, EPA may disqualify the detergent package for use in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="203"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Compositional data.</E> The compositional data supplied to EPA by the additive manufacturer for purpose of registering a detergent additive package under § 79.21(a) of this chapter must include:</P>
              <P>(i) A complete listing of the components of the detergent additive package, using standard chemical nomenclature when possible or providing the chemical structure of any component for which the standard chemical name is not precise.

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Allowable variation in compositional data.</E> (i) A single detergent additive registration may contain no variation in the identity of any of the detergent-active components identified pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) A single detergent additive registration may specify a range of concentrations for identified detergent-active components, provided that, if each such component were present in the detergent additive package at the lower bound of its reported range of concentration, the minimum recommended concentration reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section would still provide the deposit control effectiveness claimed by the detergent registrant.</P>
              <P>(iii) The identity or concentration of non-detergent-active components of the detergent additive package may vary under a single registration, provided that the range of such variation is specified in the registration, and that such variability does not reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the additive package as compared with the level of effectiveness claimed by the detergent registrant pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, detergent additive packages which do not satisfy these restrictions must be separately registered. EPA may disqualify an additive for use in satisfying the requirements of this subpart if EPA determines that the variability included within a given detergent additive registration may reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent package such that it could invalidate the minimum recommended concentration reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) A change in minimum concentration requirements resulting from a modification of detergent additive composition shall not require a new detergent additive registration or a change in existing registration if:</P>
              <P>(A) The modification is effected by a detergent blender only for its own use or for the use of parties which are subsidiaries of, or share common ownership with, the blender, and the modified detergent is not sold or transferred to other parties; and</P>
              <P>(B) The modification is a dilution of the additive for the purpose of ensuring proper detergent flow in cold weather; and</P>
              <P>(C) Gasoline is the only diluting agent used; and</P>
              <P>(D) The diluted detergent is subsequently added to gasoline at a rate that attains the detergent's registered minimum recommended concentration, taking into account the dilution; and</P>

              <P>(E) EPA is notified, either before or within seven days after the dilution action, of the identity of the detergent, the identity of the diluting material, the amount or percentage of the dilution, the change in treat rate necessitated by the dilution, and the locations and time period of diluted detergent usage. The notification shall be sent or faxed to the address in § 80.174(c).<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Minimum recommended concentration.</E> (i) The lower boundary of the recommended range of concentration for the detergent additive package in gasoline, which the additive manufacturer must report pursuant to the registration requirements in § 79.21(d) of this chapter, must equal or exceed the minimum concentration which the manufacturer has determined to be necessary for the control of deposits in the associated fuel type, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The minimum recommended concentration shall be provided to EPA in units of gallons of detergent additive package per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, reported to four digits. This concentration is the lowest additive concentration (LAC) referred to elsewhere in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) The minimum concentration reported in the detergent registration according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section must also be communicated in writing by the additive manufacturer to each fuel manufacturer who purchases the subject detergent for purpose of compliance with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, and to any additive manufacturer who purchases the subject additive with the intent of reselling it to a fuel manufacturer for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(iii) Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, EPA may require the additive manufacturer to submit data to support the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent package at the specified minimum effective concentration. EPA may disqualify an additive for use in satisfying the requirements of this subpart upon finding that the supporting data is inadequate. Manufacturers may be subject to the liabilities and enforcement actions in §§ 80.156 and 80.159 if such a finding is made.</P>
              <P>(iv) Once included in the registration for a detergent additive package, the minimum concentration recommended by the detergent manufacturer to detergent blenders and other users of the detergent additive, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, may not be changed without first notifying EPA. The notification must be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b). Changes to the minimum recommended concentration must be supported by available test data pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) A manufacturer may use a single set of test data to demonstrate the deposit control effectiveness of more than one registered detergent additive product, provided that:</P>
              <P>(A) The additive products contain all of the same detergent-active components and no detergent-active components other than those contained in common; and</P>
              <P>(B) The minimum concentration recommended for the use of each such additive product is specified such that, when each additive product is mixed in gasoline at the recommended concentration, each of its detergent-active components will be present at a final concentration no less than the lowest concentration for that component shown to be effective by the data available for the tested additive product.</P>
              <P>(d) The rate at which a detergent blender treats gasoline with a detergent additive package must be no less than the minimum recommended concentration reported for the subject detergent additive pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, except under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) If a detergent blender believes that the minimum treat rate recommended by the manufacturer of a detergent additive exceeds the amount of detergent actually required for effective deposit control, and possesses substantiating data consistent with the guidelines in paragraph (e) of this section, then, upon informing EPA in writing of these circumstances, the detergent blender may use the detergent at a lower concentration.</P>

              <P>(2) The notification to EPA must clearly specify the name of the detergent product and its manufacturer, the concentration recommended by the detergent manufacturer, and the lower concentration which the detergent blender intends to use. The notification must also attest that data are available to substantiate the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent at the intended lower concentration. The notification must be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b).<PRTPAGE P="205"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) At its discretion, EPA may require that the detergent blender submit the test data purported to substantiate the claimed effectiveness of the lower concentration of the detergent additive. EPA may also require the manufacturer of the subject detergent additive to submit test data substantiating the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent additive registration. In either case, EPA will send a letter to the appropriate party, and the supporting data will be due to EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's letter.</P>
              <P>(i) If the detergent blender fails to submit the required supporting data to EPA in the allotted time period, or if EPA judges the submitted data to be inadequate to support the detergent blender's claim that the lower concentration provides a level of deposit control consistent with the requirements of this section, then EPA will disapprove the use of the detergent at the lower concentration. Further, the detergent blender may be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to §§ 80.156 and 80.159 for any gasoline or PRC it has additized at the lower concentration.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the detergent manufacturer fails to submit the required test data to EPA within the allotted time period, EPA will proceed on the assumption that data are not available to substantiate the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent registration, and the subject additive may be disqualified for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section. The detergent manufacturer may also be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to §§ 80.156 and 80.159.</P>
              <P>(iii) If both parties submit the required information, EPA will evaluate the quality and results of both sets of test data in relation to each other and to industry-consensus test practices and standards, in a manner consistent with the guidelines described in paragraph (e) of this section. EPA will approve or disapprove the use of the detergent at the lower concentration, and will inform both the detergent blender and the detergent manufacturer of the results of its analysis within 60 days of receipt of both sets of data.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Demonstration of deposit control efficiency.</E> At its discretion, EPA may require a detergent additive registrant to provide test data to support the deposit control effectiveness of a detergent at the minimum concentration recommended, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section and § 79.21(d) of this chapter. The required supporting data must be submitted to EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's request. EPA will notify the submitter, within 60 days after receiving the supporting data, whether the data is adequate to support the deposit control efficiency claimed. Subject to the procedures specified in paragraph (g) of this section, if the supporting data are not submitted or if EPA finds the data insufficient, the detergent may be disqualified for use by fuel manufacturers in complying with the requirements of this subpart. EPA will use the following guidelines in determining the adequacy of the supporting data:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">CARB-based supporting test data.</E> For detergent additives which are certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for use in the State of California (pursuant to Title 13, section 2257 of the California Code of Regulations), the CARB certification data constitutes adequate support of the detergent's effectiveness under this section, with the exception that CARB detergent certification data specific to California Phase II reformulated gasoline (pursuant to Title 13, Chapter 5, Article 1, Subarticle 2, California Code of Regulations, Standards for Gasoline Sold Beginning March 1, 1996) will not be considered adequate support for detergent effectiveness in gasolines that do not conform to the compositional specifications for California's Phase II reformulated gasoline. For CARB-based supporting data to be used to demonstrate detergent performance, the minimum recommended concentration reported in the detergent additive registration must be no less than the concentration of the detergent-active components reported in the subject CARB detergent certification.</P>

              <P>(2) EPA will evaluate the adequacy of other supporting data according to the following guidelines:<PRTPAGE P="206"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Test fuel guidelines.</P>
              <P>(A) The gasoline used in the supporting tests must contain the detergent-active components of the subject detergent additive package in an amount which corresponds to the minimum recommended concentrations recorded in the respective detergent registration, or less than this amount.</P>
              <P>(B) The test fuels must not contain any detergent-active components other than those recorded in the subject detergent registration.</P>
              <P>(C) The test fuels used must be reasonably typical of in-use fuels in their tendency to form deposits. Test fuel taken directly from commercial refinery production stock is acceptable. Specially refined low-deposit-forming fuels such as indolene are not acceptable. Other specially blended test fuels will be evaluated by EPA for acceptability based on the extent to which such fuels adequately represent the deposit-forming tendency of typical (average) in-use fuels, as reflected in the levels of the following fuel parameters: sulfur content, aromatic content, olefin content, T-90, and oxygenate content.</P>
              <P>(D) The composition of the blended test fuel(s) used in carburetor deposit control testing, conducted to support the claimed effectiveness of detergents used in leaded gasoline, should be reasonably typical of in-use gasoline in its tendency to form carburetor deposits (or more severe than typical in-use fuels) as defined by the olefin and sulfur content. Test data using leaded fuels is preferred for this purpose, but data collected using unleaded fuels may also be acceptable provided that some correlation with additive performance in leaded fuels is available.</P>
              <P>(ii) Test procedure guidelines.</P>
              <P>(A) To be acceptable, test data submitted to support the deposit control effectiveness of a detergent additive must derive from testing conducted in conformity with good engineering practices.</P>
              <P>(B) For demonstration of fuel injector and intake valve deposit control performance, the tests specified in §§ 80.165, or other vehicle-based tests using generally accepted industry procedures and standards, are preferred. Engine-based tests may also be acceptable, assuming a reasonable correlation with vehicle-based tests and standards can be demonstrated. Bench test data may be acceptable to demonstrate fuel injector deposit control performance, assuming the results can be correlated with vehicle- or engine-based tests and standards. Bench testing will not be considered acceptable for demonstration of IVD control performance. Examples of acceptable test procedures are contained in the following references:</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Detergent identification test procedure.</E> (1) At its discretion, EPA may require the additive registrant to submit an analytical procedure capable of identifying the detergent additive in its pure state. The test procedure will be due to EPA within 30 days of the registrant's receipt of the request. Subject to the provisions in paragraph (g) of this section, if the registrant fails to submit an analytical procedure, or if EPA judges a submitted procedure to be inadequate, EPA may deny or withdraw the detergent's eligibility to be used to satisfy the detergency requirements in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The analytical procedure submitted by the registrant must be able to both qualitatively and quantitatively identify each component of the detergent additive package. To be acceptable, the procedure must provide results that conform to reasonable and customary standards of repeatability and reproducibility, and reasonable and customary limits of detection and accuracy, for the type of test in question.</P>
              <P>(3) A fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-based procedure, including an actual infrared spectrum of the detergent additive package and each component part of the detergent package obtained from this test method, is preferred.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Disqualification of a detergent additive package.</E> (1) When EPA makes a preliminary determination that a detergent additive registrant has failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c), (d)(3)(ii), (e), or (f) of this section, either by failing to submit required information for a subject detergent additive or by submitting information which EPA deems inadequate, EPA shall notify the additive registrant by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the basis for that determination and informing the registrant that the detergent may lose its eligibility to be used to comply with the detergency requirements of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) If EPA determines that the detergent registration was created by fraud or other misconduct, such as a negligent disregard for the truthfulness or accuracy of the required information or of the application, the detergent registration will be considered void <E T="03">ab initio</E> and the revocation of qualification will be retroactive to January 1, 1995 or the date on which the additive product was first registered, whichever is later.</P>

              <P>(3) The registrant will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of detergent disqualification to submit written comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If the registrant does not respond in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of disqualification, the detergent disqualification shall become final by operation of law and the Administrator shall notify the registrant of such disqualification. If the registrant responds in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to disqualify, the Administrator shall review and consider all comments submitted by the registrant before taking final action concerning the proposed disqualification. All correspondence regarding a disqualification must be sent to the address specified in § 80.174(b).<PRTPAGE P="208"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) As part of a written response to a notice of intent to disqualify, a registrant may request an informal hearing concerning the notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information the registrant wishes to present at such a hearing. If an informal hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 90 days from the date of receipt of the request. If an informal hearing is held, the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether or not the registrant has complied with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If an informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall be informal, and the hearing shall not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, or 557. A verbatim transcript of each informal hearing shall be kept and the Administrator shall consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented at the hearing in making a final decision concerning a proposed cancellation.</P>

              <P>(5) If a registrant who has received a notice of intent to disqualify submits a timely written response, and the Administrator decides after reviewing the response and the transcript of any informal hearing to disqualify the detergent for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, the Administrator shall issue a final disqualification order, forward a copy of the disqualification order to the registrant by certified mail, and promptly publish the disqualification order in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Any disqualification order issued after receipt of a timely written response by the registrant shall become legally effective five days after it is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Upon making a final decision to disqualify a detergent additive package pursuant to this paragraph (g), EPA shall inform all fuel manufacturers and secondary additive manufacturers whose product registrations report the potential use of the disqualified detergent that such detergent is no longer eligible for compliance with the requirements of this subpart. Such fuel manufacturers and secondary additive manufacturers shall have 45 days in which to stop using the ineligible detergent additive package and substitute an eligible detergent additive. When applicable, EPA shall also notify such parties that the detergent registration had been created by fraud or other misconduct, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</P>

The written blending instructions must have been supplied by the manufacturer prior to the customer's use or sale of the detergent. The instructions must accurately identify the minimum recommended concentration (lowest additive concentration) specified in the detergent's 40 CFR part 79 registration, and must also accurately identify if the detergent, at that concentration, is only registered as effective for use in leaded gasoline.</P>
              <P>(C) If the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product was produced less than one year before the manufacturer was notified by EPA of the possible violation, then the manufacturer must provide FTIR or other test results for the batch of detergent used in the noncomplying product, performed in accordance with the detergent testing procedure submitted by the manufacturer, or available for submission, pursuant to § 80.141(f).</P>

              </P>
              <P>(iv) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in § 80.157, a VAR formula record must be created for the combined detergents. The VAR compliance period must begin no later than the time of the commingling event.

Otherwise, the blender must comply with paragraph (c)(7)(v)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) If both detergents have the same LAC, and the original detergent accounts for no more than 20 percent of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent.</P>
              <P>(B) If the two detergents have different LACs and the original detergent accounts for 10 percent or less of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent, and must attain the LAC of the new detergent. If the original detergent's LAC is greater than that of the new detergent, then the compliance period may begin earlier than the date of the commingling event (pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section) only if the original detergent does not exceed 10 percent of the total detergent used during the compliance period.</P>
              <P>(C) If neither of the preceding paragraphs (c)(7)(v)(A) or (B) of this section applies, then the VAR formula record must identify both of the commingled detergents, and must use and attain the higher LAC of the two detergents. Once the commingled detergent has been depleted by an amount equal to the volume of the original detergent in the tank at the time the new detergent was added, subsequent VAR formula records must identify and use the LAC of only the new detergent.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Defense to liability for noncompliance with leaded-only use restrictions.</E> A party shall not be deemed liable for violations of § 80.155(a) or (e) caused solely by the additization or use of gasoline or PRC in violation of leaded-only use restrictions, provided that the conditions specified in § 80.169(c)(9) are met.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Volumetric additive reconciliation (“VAR”), equipment calibration, and recordkeeping requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This section contains requirements for automated detergent blending facilities and hand-blending detergent facilities. All gasolines and all PRC intended for use in gasoline must be additized, unless otherwise noted in supporting VAR records, and must be accounted for in VAR records. The VAR reconciliation standard is attained under this section when the actual concentration of detergent used per VAR formula record equals or exceeds the lowest additive concentration (LAC) specified for that detergent pursuant to § 80.141(c)(3), or, if appropriate, under § 80.141(d). A separate VAR formula record must be created for leaded gasoline additized with a detergent registered for use only with leaded gasoline, or used at a concentration that is registered as effective for leaded gasoline only. Detergent so used <PRTPAGE P="215"/>must be accurately and separately measured, either through the use of a separate storage tank, a separate meter, or some other measurement system that is able to accurately distinguish its use. Recorded volumes of gasoline, detergent, and PRC must be expressed to the nearest gallon (or smaller units), except that detergent volumes of five gallons or less must be expressed to the nearest tenth of a gallon (or smaller units). However, if the blender's equipment cannot accurately measure to the nearest tenth of a gallon, then such volumes must be rounded downward to the next lower gallon. PRC included in the reconciliation must be identified. Each VAR formula record must also contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Automated blending facilities.</E> In the case of an automated detergent blending facility, for each VAR period, for each detergent storage system and each detergent in that storage system, the following must be recorded:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the detergent additive package being reconciled, and the LAC specified in the detergent registration for use with the applicable type of gasoline (i.e., unleaded or leaded). The LAC must be expressed in terms of gallons of detergent per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, and expressed to four digits. If the specified LAC is only effective for use with leaded gasoline, the record must so indicate. If the detergent storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.</P>
              <P>(2) The total volume of detergent blended into gasoline and PRC, in accordance with one of the following paragraphs, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(i) For a facility which uses in-line meters to measure detergent usage, the total volume of detergent measured, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter readings for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.</P>

              <P>(ii) For a facility which uses a gauge to measure the inventory of the detergent storage tank, the total volume of detergent shall be calculated from the following equation:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Detergent Volume = (A) − (B) + (C) − (D)</FP>
              
              <EXTRACT>
                <FP>where:</FP>
                
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">A = Initial detergent inventory of the tank</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">B = Final detergent inventory of the tank</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">C = Sum of any additions to detergent inventory</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D = Sum of any withdrawals from detergent inventory for purposes other than the additization of gasoline or PRC.</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <FP>The value of each variable in this equation must be separately recorded on the VAR formula record. In addition, a list of each detergent addition included in variable C and a list of each detergent withdrawal included in variable D must be provided, either on the formula record or as VAR supporting documentation.</FP>
              <P>(3) The total volume of gasoline plus PRC to which detergent has been added, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: The beginning and ending meter measurements for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. If gasoline has intentionally been overadditized in anticipation of the later addition of unadditized PRC, then the total volume of gasoline plus PRC recorded must include the expected amount of unadditized PRC to be added later. In addition, the amount of gasoline which was overadditized for this purpose must be specified.</P>

              <P>(4) The actual detergent concentration, calculated as the total volume of detergent added (pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section), divided by the total volume of gasoline plus PRC (pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four digits.<PRTPAGE P="216"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) A list of each detergent concentration rate initially set for the detergent that is the subject of the VAR record, together with the date and description of each adjustment to any initially set concentration. The concentration adjustment information may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. No concentration setting is permitted below the applicable LAC, except as may be modified pursuant to § 80.141(d) or as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) The dates of the VAR period, which shall be no longer than thirty-one days. If the VAR period is contemporaneous with a calendar month, then specifying the month will fulfill this requirement; if not, then the beginning and ending dates and times of the VAR period must be listed. The times may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in supporting documentation. Any adjustment to any detergent concentration rate more than 10 percent over the concentration rate initially set in the VAR period shall terminate that VAR period and initiate a new VAR period, except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) The concentration setting for a detergent injector may be set below the applicable LAC, or it may be adjusted more than 10 percent above the concentration initially set in the VAR period without terminating that VAR period, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The purpose of the change is to correct a batch misadditization prior to the end of the VAR period and prior to the transfer of the batch to another party, or to correct an equipment malfunction; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The concentration is immediately returned after the correction to a concentration that fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The blender creates and maintains documentation establishing the date and adjustments of the correction; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If the correction is initiated only to rectify an equipment malfunction, and the amount of detergent used in this procedure is not added to gasoline in the compliance period, then this amount is subtracted from the detergent volume listed on the VAR formula record.</P>
              <P>(8) If unadditized gasoline has been transferred from the facility, other than bulk transfers from refineries or pipelines to non-retail outlets or non-WPC facilities, the total amount of such gasoline must be specified.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-automated facilities.</E> In the case of a facility in which hand blending or any other non-automated method is used to blend detergent, for each detergent and for each batch of gasoline and each batch of PRC to which the detergent is being added, the following shall be recorded:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the detergent additive package being reconciled, and the LAC specified in the detergent registration for use with the applicable type of gasoline (i.e., unleaded or leaded). The LAC must be expressed in terms of gallons of detergent per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, and expressed to four digits. If the specified LAC is only effective for use with leaded gasoline, the record must so indicate.</P>
              <P>(2) The date of the additization that is the subject of the VAR formula record.</P>
              <P>(3) The volume of added detergent.</P>
              <P>(4) The volume of the gasoline and/or PRC to which the detergent has been added. If gasoline has intentionally been overadditized in anticipation of the later addition of unadditized PRC, then the total volume of gasoline plus PRC recorded must include the expected amount of unadditized PRC to be added later. In addition, the amount of gasoline which was overadditized for this purpose must be specified.</P>
              <P>(5) The brand (if known), grade, and leaded/unleaded status of gasoline, and/or the type of PRC.</P>
              <P>(6) The actual detergent concentration, calculated as the volume of added detergent (pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section), divided by the volume of gasoline and/or PRC (pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four digits.</P>

              <P>(c) Every VAR formula record created pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) <PRTPAGE P="217"/>of this section shall contain the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The signature of the creator of the VAR record;</P>
              <P>(2) The date of the creation of the VAR record; and</P>
              <P>(3) A certification of correctness by the creator of the VAR record.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Electronically-generated VAR formula and supporting records.</E> (1) Electronically-generated records are acceptable for VAR formula records and supporting documentation (including PTDs), provided that they are complete, accessible, and easily readable. VAR formula records must also be stored with access and audit security, which must restrict to a limited number of specified people those who have the ability to alter or delete the records. In addition, parties maintaining records electronically must make available for EPA use the hardware and software necessary to review the records.</P>
              <P>(2) Electronically-generated VAR formula records may use an electronic user identification code to satisfy the signature requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The use of the ID is limited to the record creator; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A paper record is maintained, which is signed and dated by the VAR formula record creator, acknowledging that the use of that particular user ID on a VAR formula record is equivalent to his/her signature on the document.</P>
              <P>(e) Automated detergent blenders must calibrate their detergent equipment once in each calendar half year, with the acceptable calibrations being no less than one hundred twenty days apart. Equipment recalibration is also required each time the detergent package is changed, unless written documentation indicates that the new detergent package has the same viscosity as the previous detergent package. Detergent package change calibrations may be used to satisfy the semiannual requirement provided that the calibrations occur in the appropriate half calendar year and are no less than one hundred twenty days apart.</P>
              <P>(f) The following VAR supporting documentation must also be created and maintained:</P>
              <P>(1) For all automated detergent blending facilities, documentation reflecting performance of the calibrations required by paragraph (e) of this section, and any associated adjustments of the automated detergent equipment;</P>
              <P>(2) For all hand-blending facilities which are terminals, a record specifying, for each calendar month, the total volume in gallons of transfers from the facility of unadditized base gasoline;</P>
              <P>(3) For all detergent blending facilities, product transfer documents for all gasoline, detergent and detergent-additized PRC transferred into or out of the facility; in addition, bills of lading, transfer, or sale for all unadditized PRC transferred into the facility;</P>
              <P>(4) For all automated detergent blending facilities, documentation establishing the brands (if known) and grades of the gasoline which is the subject of the VAR formula record;</P>
              <P>(5) For all hand blending detergent blenders, the documentation, if in the party's possession, supporting the volumes of gasoline, PRC, and detergent reported on the VAR formula record; and</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents.</E> For each occasion when any gasoline refiner, importer, reseller, distributor, carrier, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, distributor, carrier, or blender, transfers custody or title to any gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC other than when detergent-additized gasoline is sold or dispensed at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility to the ultimate consumer, the transferor shall provide to the transferee, and the transferee shall acquire from the transferor, documents which accurately include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The names and addresses of the transferee and transferor; the address requirement may be fulfilled, in the alternative, through separate documentation which establishes said addresses and is maintained by the parties and made available to EPA for the same length of time as required for the PTDs, provided that the normal business procedure of these parties is not to identify addresses on PTDs.</P>
              <P>(2) The date of the transfer.</P>
              <P>(3) The volume of product transferred.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) The identity of the product being transferred (i.e., its identity as base gasoline, detergent, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized oxygenate or detergent-additized gasoline blending stock that comprises a detergent-additized PRC). PTDs for detergent-additized gasoline or PRC are not required to identify the particular detergent used to additize the product.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the product being transferred consists of two or more different types of product subject to this regulation, i.e., base gasoline, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized PRC, then the PTD for the commingled product must identify each such type of component contained in the commingled product.</P>
              <P>(5) If the product being transferred is base gasoline, then in addition to the base gasoline identification, the following warning must be stated on the PTD: “Not for sale to the ultimate consumer”. If, pursuant to § 80.160(a), the product being transferred is exempt base gasoline to be used for research, development, or test purposes only, the following warning must also be stated on the PTD: “For use in research, development, and test programs only.”</P>
              <P>(6) The name of the detergent additive as reported in its registration must be used to identify the detergent package on its PTD.</P>
              <P>(7) If the product being transferred is leaded gasoline, then the PTD must disclose that the product contains lead and/or phosphorous, as applicable.</P>

              <P>(8) If the product being transferred is detergent that is only authorized for the control of carburetor deposits, then <PRTPAGE P="219"/>the following must be stated on the detergent's transfer document: “For use with leaded gasoline only.”</P>
              <P>(9) If the product being transferred is detergent-additized gasoline that has been overadditized in anticipation of the later (or earlier) addition of PRC, then the PTD must include a statement that the product has been overadditized to account for a specified volume in gallons, or a specified percentage of the product's total volume, of additional, specified PRC.</P>
              <P>(b) Gasoline may not be additized with a detergent authorized only for the control of carburetor deposits and whose product transfer document states “For use with leaded gasoline only”, and gasoline may not be additized at the lower concentration specified for a detergent authorized at a lower concentration for the control of carburetor deposits only, unless the product transfer document for the gasoline to be additized identifies it as leaded gasoline.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of product codes and other non-regulatory language.</E> (1) Product codes and other non-regulatory language may not be used as a substitute for the specified PTD warning language specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for base gasoline, except that:</P>
              <P>(i) The specified warning language may be omitted for bulk transfers of base gasoline from a refinery to a pipeline if there is a prior written agreement between the parties specifying that all such gasoline is unadditized and will not be transferred to the ultimate consumer;</P>
              <P>(ii) Product codes may be used as a substitute for the specified warning language provided that the PTD is an electronic data interchange (EDI) document being used solely for the transfer of title to the base gasoline, and provided that the product codes otherwise comply with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Product codes and other language not specified in this section may otherwise be used to comply with PTD information requirements, provided that they are clear, accurate, and not misleading.</P>
              <P>(3) If product codes are used, they must be standardized throughout the distribution system in which they are used, and downstream parties must be informed of their full meaning.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">PTD exemption for small transfers of additized gasoline.</E> Transfers of additized gasoline are exempt from the PTD requirements of this section provided all the following conditions are followed:</P>
              <P>(1) The product is being transferred by a distributor who is not the product's detergent blender; and</P>
              <P>(2) The recipient is a wholesale purchaser-consumer (WPC) or other ultimate consumer of gasoline, for its own use only or for that of its agents or employees; and</P>
              <P>(3) The volume of additized gasoline being transferred is not greater than 550 gallons.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Recordkeeping period.</E> Any person creating, providing or acquiring product transfer documentation for gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, shall retain the documents required by this section for a period of five years from the date the product transfer documentation was created, received or transferred, as applicable, and shall deliver such documents to EPA upon request. WPCs are not required to retain PTDs of additized gasoline received by them.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Detergent additive certification program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Effective dates and applicability of requirements.</E> (1) As of July 1, 1997:</P>
              <P>(i) Detergent additives for the control of port fuel injector deposits (PFID) and/or intake valve deposits (IVD) in gasoline engines may not be transferred or sold for use in compliance with this subpart unless such additives have been certified according to the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided in § 80.169(c)(8), PFID and IVD control additives may not be added to gasoline or post-refinery component (PRC) for compliance with this subpart unless such additives have been certified according to the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Gasoline may not be sold or transferred to a party who sells or transfers gasoline to the ultimate consumer unless such gasoline contains detergent additives which have been certified according to the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Beginning August 1, 1997, all gasoline sold or transferred to the ultimate consumer must contain detergent additive(s) which have been certified, according to the requirements of this section, to be effective for the control of PFID and IVD in gasoline engines.</P>
              <P>(3) Except as specifically exempted in § 80.173, these detergency requirements apply to all gasoline, whether intended for on-highway or nonroad use, including conventional, oxygenated, reformulated, and leaded gasolines, as well as the gasoline component in mixtures of petroleum and alcohol fuels, gasoline used as marine fuel, gasoline service accumulation fuel (as described in § 86.113-94(a)(1) of this chapter), the gasoline component of fuel mixtures of petroleum and methanol used for service accumulation in flexible fuel vehicles (as described in § 86.113-94(d) of this chapter), the gasoline used for factory fill purposes, and all additized PRC.</P>
              <P>(4) The specific controls and prohibitions applicable to persons subject to these regulations are set forth in § 80.168.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Detergent additive certification requirements.</E> For a detergent additive package to be certified as eligible for use by detergent blenders in complying <PRTPAGE P="222"/>with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, the requirements listed in this paragraph (b) must be satisfied for such detergent. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, if the certifier fails to conduct the specified tests or to submit the specified materials, or if EPA judges the testing or materials to be inadequate, or if the detergent fails EPA confirmatory deposit control performance testing pursuant to § 80.167, the Administrator may deny or withdraw the detergent's eligibility to be used to satisfy the detergency requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The detergent additive manufacturer must properly register the detergent additive under 40 CFR part 79. For this purpose:</P>
              <P>(i) The compositional data required under § 79.21(a) of this chapter shall include the information specified in § 80.162.</P>
              <P>(ii) The minimum recommended additive concentration required under § 79.21(d) of this chapter shall be reported to EPA in units of gallons of detergent additive package per 1000 gallons of gasoline or PRC, provided to four digits. This concentration is the lowest additive concentration (LAC) referred to in § 80.170, and shall be reported as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For a detergent additive registered for use in unleaded gasoline, the minimum concentration must be determined and reported for each certification option under which the manufacturer wishes to certify the additive pursuant to § 80.163.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) In the case of a detergent certified for use in California gasoline based on an existing certification granted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), pursuant to § 80.163(d), the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount specified in the CARB certification.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In the case of the alternative national generic certification option pursuant to § 80.163(a)(1)(iii), the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount mixed into the associated test fuel specified in § 80.177, which was shown to satisfy the fuel injector deposit control and intake valve deposit control performance tests and standards specified in § 80.176.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) In the case of any other detergent certification option, the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount mixed into the associated test fuel specified in § 80.164, which was shown to satisfy the fuel injector deposit control and intake valve deposit control performance tests and standards specified in § 80.165.</P>
              <P>(B) For a detergent registered for use in leaded gasoline, the minimum recommended concentration must be no less than the amount shown to be needed for control of carburetor deposits, pursuant to the test procedure and test fuel guidelines in § 80.166.</P>
              <P>(C) Once it has been registered by EPA, the minimum recommended concentration specified by a detergent manufacturer to detergent blenders and other users of the additive, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, may not be changed without first notifying EPA. Such notification should be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b). The change in minimum concentration must be supported by existing certification data or else the notification to EPA must be accompanied by new certification information which demonstrates that the modification is consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(D) A manufacturer may use a single set of certification test data to demonstrate the deposit control effectiveness of more than one registered detergent additive product, provided that:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The additive products contain all of the same detergent-active components and no detergent-active components other than those contained in common; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The minimum concentration recommended for the use of each such additive product is specified such that, when each additive product is mixed in gasoline at the recommended concentration, each of its detergent-active components will be present at a final concentration no less than the lowest concentration of that component which was present when the tested additive product met the PFID and IVD performance standards specified in § 80.165.</P>

              <P>(2) The detergent additive manufacturer (or other certifying party) must submit to EPA a sample of the actual <PRTPAGE P="223"/>detergent additive package which was used in the certification test fuels specified in § 80.164 or § 80.177 or, if such sample is not available, then a sample which has the same composition as the package used in certification testing.</P>
              <P>(i) The sample volume shall be between 250 ml and 500 ml.</P>
              <P>(ii) The sample shall be packaged in a container which has a resealable closure and which will maintain sample integrity for at least one year. The container shall be labeled with the name and address of the manufacturer and the name of the detergent additive package.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any known shelf life limitations, and any available information on optimal temperature, light exposure, or other conditions to prolong sample shelf life, shall be provided.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the certifying party wishes to claim that the sample or any accompanying documents are entitled to special handling for reasons of business confidentiality, the party must clearly identify the sample or documents as such. EPA will handle any samples or documents with such claims according to the regulations at 40 CFR part 2.</P>
              <P>(v) The sample shall be submitted to EPA, at the address provided in § 80.174(a), within seven days of the date on which the certification letter for the detergent package is sent to EPA as required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The detergent additive manufacturer (or other certifying party) shall submit a certification letter for the detergent additive package to the address in § 80.174(b). The party must use certified or express mail with return receipt service. The letter shall be signed by a person legally authorized to represent the certifying party and shall contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Identifying information.</P>
              <P>(A) The name and address of the detergent additive manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(B) In any case where the certifier is not the detergent additive manufacturer, such as in the case of a fuel-specific certification pursuant to § 80.163(c), the name and address of the certifier.</P>
              <P>(C) The commercial identifying name of the detergent additive product as registered under the requirements of § 79.21 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement attesting that:</P>
              <P>(A) The detergent package which is the subject of this certification has been tested according to applicable procedural and test fuel requirements in this subpart and has met the applicable performance standards; and</P>
              <P>(B) The testing was conducted in a manner consistent with good engineering practices; and</P>
              <P>(C) Complete documentation of the test fuel formulation, IVD demonstration procedures, fuel injector deposit demonstration procedure if applicable, detergent performance test procedures, and test results are available for EPA's inspection upon request.</P>
              <P>(iii) The name and location of the laboratory(ies) at which the certification testing was conducted and the dates during which the testing was conducted.</P>
              <P>(iv) For each option under which certification is sought pursuant to § 80.163, specifications of the test fuel(s) in which the detergent underwent performance testing. These fuel specifications must include:</P>
              <P>(A) The sulfur content in weight percent.</P>
              <P>(B) The T-90 distillation point in degrees Fahrenheit.</P>
              <P>(C) The olefin content in volume percent.</P>
              <P>(D) The aromatic content in volume percent.</P>
              <P>(E) The identity and volume percent of any oxygenate compound.</P>
              <P>(F) The source of the test fuel(s) and/or fuel blend stocks used to formulate the test fuel(s).</P>
              <P>(v) In the case of a national or PADD certification (pursuant to § 80.163(a)(1) or (b)) for which the test fuel was specially formulated from refinery blend stocks, the results of the IVD demonstration test, pursuant to § 80.164(b)(3). In the case of an alternative national generic certification (pursuant to § 80.163(a)(1)(iii)), the results of the IVD demonstration test and fuel injector deposit demonstration test (pursuant to § 80.177).</P>

              <P>(vi) In the case of a fuel-specific detergent certification, pursuant to § 80.163(c), the definition of the segregated gasoline pool, including any <PRTPAGE P="224"/>permitted PRC, for which the certification is sought, and the fuel parameter percentile distributions determined for the subject gasoline pool, as specified in § 80.164(c). The percentile distributions must include all of the fuel parameters listed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section, along with any other fuel parameter(s) which the certifier wishes to use to define the certification fuel. As specified in § 80.164(c)(1)(iv), the procedures used to measure the additional parameters must be identified, as well as the levels of these additional parameters present in the test fuel(s).</P>
              <P>(vii) In the case of a certification for California gasoline based on an existing certification granted by CARB, pursuant to § 80.163(d), a copy of the CARB certificate.</P>
              <P>(viii) The test concentration(s) of the subject detergent additive in each test fuel, and the corresponding test results (percent flow restriction demonstrated in the fuel injector test and milligrams of deposit per valve demonstrated in the IVD test).</P>
              <P>(ix) For each option under which certification of the detergent is sought, the minimum recommended concentration which the certifying party seeks to establish for the detergent additive package, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) EPA will acknowledge receipt of the detergent certification letter. The effective date of certification will be the sooner of 60 days from the date on which EPA receives the certification letter, or the certifier's receipt of EPA's acknowledgement of the certification letter. However, neither the passage of 60 days nor EPA's acknowledgement will signify acceptance by EPA of the validity of the information in the certification letter or the adequacy or potency of the detergent sample submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. EPA may elect at any time to review the detergent certification data, analyze the submitted detergent additive sample, or subject the detergent additive package to confirmatory testing as described in § 80.167 and, where appropriate, may disqualify a detergent certification according to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The minimum concentration reported in the detergent registration according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, plus any restrictions in use associated with that concentration, must be accurately communicated in writing by the additive manufacturer to each fuel manufacturer or detergent blender who purchases the subject detergent for purpose of compliance with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, and to any additive manufacturer who purchases the subject additive with the intent of reselling it to a fuel manufacturer for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(d) The rate at which a detergent blender treats gasoline with a detergent additive package must be no less than the minimum recommended concentration reported for the subject detergent additive pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, except under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) If a detergent blender possesses deposit control performance test results as specified in § 80.165, § 80.166, or § 80.176 which show that the minimum treat rate recommended by the manufacturer of a detergent additive product exceeds the amount of that detergent actually required for effective deposit control, then, upon informing EPA in writing of these circumstances, the detergent blender may use the detergent at the lower concentration substantiated by these test results.</P>
              <P>(2) The notification to EPA must clearly specify the name of the detergent product and its manufacturer, the concentration recommended by the detergent manufacturer, and the lower concentration which the detergent blender intends to use. The notification must also attest that the required data are available to substantiate the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent at the intended lower concentration. The notification must be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b).</P>

              <P>(3) At its discretion, EPA may require that the detergent blender submit the test data purported to substantiate the claimed effectiveness of the lower concentration of the detergent additive. In addition, EPA may require <PRTPAGE P="225"/>the manufacturer of the subject detergent additive to submit test data substantiating the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent additive registration. In either case, EPA will send a letter to the appropriate party; the supporting data will be due to EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's letter.</P>
              <P>(i) If the detergent blender fails to submit the required supporting data to EPA in the allotted time period, or if EPA judges the submitted data to be inadequate to support the detergent blender's claim that the lower concentration provides a level of deposit control consistent with the requirements of this section, then EPA will disapprove the use of the detergent at the lower concentration. Further, the detergent blender may be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to §§ 80.169 and 80.172 for any gasoline or PRC it has additized at the lower concentration.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the detergent manufacturer fails to submit the required test data to EPA within the allotted time period, EPA will proceed on the assumption that data are not available to substantiate the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent registration, and the subject additive may be disqualified for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section. The detergent manufacturer may also be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties in §§ 80.169 and 80.172.</P>
              <P>(iii) If both parties submit the required information, EPA will evaluate the quality and results of both sets of test data, and will either approve or disapprove the use of the lower treat rate submitted by the detergent blender. EPA will inform both parties of the results of its analysis.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Disqualification of a detergent additive package.</E> (1) When EPA makes a preliminary determination that a detergent additive certifier has failed to comply with the detergent certification requirements of this section, including a failure to submit required materials for a detergent additive or submission of materials which EPA deems inadequate, or if a detergent additive fails confirmatory testing conducted pursuant to § 80.167, EPA shall notify the additive certifier by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the basis for that determination and informing the certifier that the detergent may lose its eligibility to be used to comply with the detergency requirements of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) If EPA determines that the detergent certification was created by fraud or other misconduct, such as a negligent disregard for the truthfulness or accuracy of the required information, the detergent certification will be considered void <E T="03">ab initio</E> and the disqualification will be retroactive to July 1, 1997 or the date on which the additive product was first certified, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(3) The certifier will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of detergent disqualification to submit written comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the specific requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If the certifier does not respond in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of disqualification, the detergent disqualification shall become final and the Administrator shall notify the certifier of such final disqualification order. If the certifier responds in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to disqualify, the Administrator shall review and consider all comments submitted by the certifier before taking final action concerning the proposed disqualification. All correspondence regarding a disqualification must be sent to the address provided in § 80.174(b).</P>

              <P>(4) As part of a written response to a notice of intent to disqualify, a certifier may request an informal hearing concerning the notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information the certifier wishes to present at such a hearing. If an informal hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 90 days from the date of receipt of the request. If an informal hearing is held, the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether or not the certifier has complied with the specific requirements which provide the basis for <PRTPAGE P="226"/>the proposed disqualification. If an informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall be informal, and the hearing shall not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, or 557. A verbatim transcript of each informal hearing shall be kept and the Administrator (or designee) shall consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented at the hearing in making a final decision concerning a proposed disqualification.</P>

              <P>(5) If a certifier who has received a notice of intent to disqualify submits a timely written response, and the Administrator (or designee) decides after reviewing the response and the transcript of any informal hearing to disqualify the detergent for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, the Administrator (or designee) shall issue a final disqualification order and forward a copy of the disqualification order to the certifier by certified mail. Notice of the disqualification order will also be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The disqualification will become effective as of the date on which the copy of the order is received by the certifier. If the certifier is also a blender of the disqualified additive, then the certifier must stop using the ineligible detergent upon receipt of the disqualification order.</P>

              <P>(6) Within 10 days of receipt of EPA's notification of the final decision to disqualify a detergent additive package pursuant to this paragraph (e), the detergent certifier must submit to EPA, at the address specified in § 80.174(b), a list of its customers who use the disqualified detergent. Failure to do so may subject the certifier to liabilities for violations of § 80.168 that result from the use of the uncertified detergent. EPA shall inform the certifier's customers by certified mail that the detergent is no longer eligible for compliance with the requirements of this subpart. These parties must stop using the ineligible detergent additive package and substitute an eligible detergent additive within 45 days of receiving the notification, or within 45 days of publication of the disqualification notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> whichever occurs sooner.</P>

              <P>For a detergent additive product to be eligible for use by detergent blenders in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, the compositional data to be supplied to EPA by the additive manufacturer for the purpose of registering a detergent additive package under § 79.21(a) of this chapter must include the items listed in this section. In the case of items requiring measurement or other technical analysis, and for which a specific test procedure is not stipulated herein, the procedure must conform to reasonable and customary standards of repeatability and reproducibility, and reasonable and customary limits of detection and accuracy for the type of test procedure or analytic procedure in question. At EPA's request, detailed documentation of any such test procedure must be submitted within 10 days of the registrant's receipt of EPA's request.</P>
              <P>(a) A complete listing of the components of the detergent additive package and the weight and/or volume percent (as applicable) of each component of the package.</P>
              <P>(1) When possible, standard chemical nomenclature shall be used or the chemical structure of the component shall be given. Polymeric components may be reported as the product of other chemical reactants, provided that the supporting data specified in paragraph (b) of this section is also reported.</P>
              <P>(2) Each detergent-active component of the package shall be classified into one of the following designations:</P>
              <P>(i) Polyalkyl amine;</P>
              <P>(ii) Polyether amine;</P>
              <P>(iii) Polyalkylsuccinimide;</P>

              <P>(vi) Detergent-active synthetic carrier oil; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Other detergent-active component (identify category, if feasible.)</P>
              <P>(3) Composition variability.<PRTPAGE P="227"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The composition of a detergent additive reported in a single additive registration (and the detergent additive product sold under a single additive registration) may not:</P>
              <P>(A) Include detergent-active components which differ in identity from those contained in the detergent additive package at the time of certification testing; or</P>
              <P>(B) Include a range of concentration for any detergent-active component such that, if the component were present in the detergent additive package at the lower bound of the reported range, the deposit control effectiveness of the additive package would be reduced as compared with the level of effectiveness demonstrated during certification testing. Subject to the foregoing constraint, a detergent additive product sold under a particular additive registration may contain a higher concentration of the detergent-active component(s) than the concentration(s) of such component(s) reported in the registration for the additive.</P>
              <P>(ii) The identity or concentration of non-detergent-active components of the detergent additive package may vary under a single registration provided that such variability does not reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the additive package as compared with the level of effectiveness demonstrated during certification testing.</P>
              <P>(A) Unless the additive manufacturer (or other certifying party) provides EPA with data to substantiate that a carrier oil does not act to enhance the detergent additive package's ability to control deposits, any carrier oil contained in the detergent additive package, whether petroleum-based or synthetic, must be treated as a detergent-active component in accordance with the additive compositional reporting requirements in § 80.162(a)(2). Such data should be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b).</P>
              <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section, detergent additive packages which do not satisfy the restrictions in this paragraph (a)(3) must be separately registered. EPA may disqualify an additive for use in satisfying the requirements of this subpart if EPA determines that the variability included within a given detergent additive registration may reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent package such that it may invalidate the minimum recommended concentration reported in accordance with the applicable requirements of § 80.161(b)(1)(ii).</P>
              <P>(iv) A change in minimum concentration requirements resulting from a modification of detergent additive composition shall not require a new detergent additive registration or a change in existing registration if:</P>
              <P>(A) The modification is effected by a detergent blender only for its own use or for the use of parties which are subsidiaries of, or share common ownership with, the blender, and the modified detergent is not sold or transferred to other parties; and</P>
              <P>(B) The modification is a dilution of the additive for the purpose of ensuring proper detergent flow in cold weather; and</P>
              <P>(C) Gasoline is the only diluting agent used; and</P>
              <P>(D) The diluted detergent is subsequently added to gasoline at a rate that attains the detergent's registered minimum recommended concentration, taking into account the dilution; and</P>
              <P>(E) EPA is notified, either before or within seven days after the dilution action, of the identity of the detergent, the identity of the diluting material, the amount or percentage of the dilution, the change in treat rate necessitated by the dilution, and the locations and time period of diluted detergent usage. The notification shall be sent or faxed to the address in § 80.174(c).</P>
              <P>(b) For detergent-active polymers and detergent-active carrier oils which are reported as the product of other chemical reactants:</P>

              <P>(1) Identification of the reactant materials and the manufacturer's acceptance criteria for determining that these materials are suitable for use in synthesizing detergent components. The manufacturer must maintain documentation, and submit it to EPA upon request, demonstrating that the acceptance criteria reported to EPA are the same criteria which the manufacturer specifies to the suppliers of the reactant materials.<PRTPAGE P="228"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A Gel Permeation Chromatograph (GPC), providing the molecular weight distribution of the polymer or detergent-active carrier oil components and the concentration of each chromatographic peak representing more than one percent of the total mass. For these results to be acceptable, the GPC test procedure must include equipment calibration with a polystyrene standard or other readily attainable and generally accepted calibration standard. The identity of the calibration standard must be provided, together with the GPC characterization of the standard.</P>
              <P>(c) For non-detergent-active carrier oils, the following parameters:</P>
              <P>(1) T10, T50, and T90 distillation points, and end boiling point, measured according to applicable test procedures cited in § 80.46.</P>

              <P>(3) Concentration of oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, if greater than or equal to 0.5 percent (by weight) of the carrier oil</P>
              <P>(d) Description of an FTIR-based method appropriate for identifying the detergent additive package and its detergent-active components (polymers, carrier oils, and others) both qualitatively and quantitatively, together with the actual infrared spectra of the detergent additive package and each detergent-active component obtained by this test method. The FTIR infrared spectra submitted in connection with the registration of a detergent additive package must reflect the results of a test conducted on a sample of the additive containing the detergent-active component(s) at a concentration no lower than the concentration(s) (or the lower bound of a range of concentration) reported in the registration pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section.</P>

              <P>(e) To provide a basis for establishing an affirmative defense to presumptive liability pursuant to § 80.169(c)(4)(i)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>), specific physical parameters must be identified which the manufacturer considers adequate and appropriate, in combination with other information and sampling requirements under this subpart, for identifying the detergent additive package and monitoring its production quality control.</P>
              <P>(1) Such parameters shall include (but need not be limited to) viscosity, density, and basic nitrogen content, unless the additive manufacturer specifically requests, and EPA approves, the substitution of other parameter(s) which the manufacturer considers to be more appropriate for a particular additive package. The request must be made in writing and must include an explanation of how the requested physical parameter(s) are helpful as indicator(s) of detergent production quality control. EPA will respond to such requests in writing; the additional parameters are not approved until the certifier receives EPA's written approval.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer shall identify a standardized measurement method, consistent with the chemical and physical nature of the detergent product, which will be used to measure each parameter. The documented ASTM repeatability for the method shall also be cited. The manufacturer's target value for each parameter in the detergent package, and the expected range of production values for each parameter, shall be specified.</P>
              <P>(3) EPA will consider the parameter measurements to be an acceptable basis for establishing an affirmative defense to presumptive liability, if the expected range of variability differs from the target value by an amount no greater than five times the standard repeatability of the test procedure, or by no more than 10 percent of the target value, whichever is less. However, in the case of nitrogen analysis or other procedures for measuring concentrations of specific chemical compounds or elements, when the target value is less than 10 parts per million, a range of variability up to 50 percent of the target value will be considered acceptable.</P>

              <P>(4) If a manufacturer wishes to rely on measurement methods or production variability ranges which do not conform to the above limitations, then the manufacturer must receive prior written approval from EPA in order to be assured that any related parameter <PRTPAGE P="229"/>measurements will be considered an acceptable basis for establishing an affirmative defense. A request for such allowance must be made in writing. It must fully justify the adequacy of the test procedure, explain why a broader range of variability is required, and provide evidence that the production detergent will perform adequately throughout the requested range of variability.</P>

              <P>(1) A detergent certified under this option is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in the defined gasoline pool reported in the certification letter pursuant to § 80.161(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(i) The gasoline pool may only include gasoline produced or distributed from the facilities covered by the fuel survey which was used to define the fuel-specific certification test fuels, pursuant to § 80.164(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(ii) The gasoline pool must be kept segregated from any other gasoline prior to blending with the detergent additive.</P>
              <P>(iii) Depending on the oxygenate components added to the test fuel pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2), the gasoline pool may be inclusive of all grades and all oxygenate blending characteristics (i.e., generic), or may be restricted to non-oxygenated gasoline, or to gasoline containing a specific oxygenate compound. The certification may also be restricted to premium grade gasoline. Any such use restrictions must be specified in the certification letter. Provisions in §§ 80.168 and 80.171(a)(9) through (12) related to such use restrictions also apply.</P>
              <P>(2) Detergent certification under this option entails special initial and annual reporting requirements, specified under §§ 80.161(b)(3)(vi) and 80.164(c)(3), which necessitate that the responsible party have control over and access to the segregated gasoline pool for which the detergent is certified. For this reason, the certifying party under this option is likely to be (but is not required to be) a fuel manufacturer or detergent blender, rather than the additive manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(3) If a certifier demonstrates that the required test fuel representing a segregated pool of gasoline meets the deposit control performance standards specified in § 80.165 in the absence of a detergent additive, or using a detergent additive which has only PFID-control activity, then this gasoline pool (and PFID detergent, if applicable) can be certified accordingly under the fuel-specific option.</P>
              <P>(4) Gasoline properly additized with a detergent certified under the fuel-specific option may be transferred or sold anywhere within the United States and its territories (subject to approved State programs).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">CARB-Based Certification.</E> A valid certification under section 2257 of Title 13, California Code of Regulations (CARB certification) may be the basis for a certification under the following restrictions and conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) A detergent certified under this option may be used at the LAC specified in the CARB certification only in gasoline that meets the requirements of California Phase II reformulated gasoline (pursuant to Title 13, Chapter 5, Article 1, Subarticle 2, California Code of Regulations, Standards for Gasoline Sold Beginning March 1, 1996). The grade(s) of California gasoline which may be so additized, and the oxygenate(s) which may be present, are as specified in the CARB certification for the detergent in question.</P>
              <P>(2) The gasoline must be either: Additized in California; or sold or dispensed to the ultimate consumer in California (or to parties who sell or dispense to the ultimate consumer in California); or both additized and ultimately dispensed in California.</P>
              <P>(3) A certification under this option will continue to be valid only as long as the CARB certification remains valid. The certifier must cease selling or using a detergent immediately upon being notified by CARB that the CARB certification for this detergent has been invalidated, and must notify EPA within 7 days of receipt of this notification.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> This section provides specifications for the test fuels required in conjunction with the certification options described in §§ 80.163(a)(1) and 80.163(b) through (d). For each such certification option, the associated test fuel must meet or exceed the levels of four basic fuel parameters (aromatics, fuel sulfur, olefins, and T-90) prescribed here and may also contain specified oxygenate compounds. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, some <PRTPAGE P="232"/>fuels must undergo an IVD demonstration test before they are eligible to be used as test fuels under this certification program. Test fuel characteristics must be reported to EPA in the detergent certification letter required pursuant to § 80.161(b)(3). The specifications for the test fuels required in conjunction with the alternative national generic certification option in § 80.163(a)(1)(iii) are contained in § 80.177.</P>
              <P>(1) Quantitative specifications for the four basic fuel parameters, provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, refer to the levels of these parameters in the base gasoline prior to the addition of any oxygenate. The levels of the basic fuel parameters must be measured in accordance with applicable procedures in § 80.46.</P>
              <P>(2) Oxygenate components of certification test fuels must be of fuel grade quality. The type and amount of oxygenate to be blended into the test fuel (if any) shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) To certify a detergent for generic use (i.e., for use in gasoline containing any oxygenate compound, as well as for use in nonoxygenated gasoline), the finished test fuel shall contain ethanol at 10 volume percent.</P>
              <P>(ii) To certify a detergent specifically for use in nonoxygenated gasoline, no oxygenate compounds shall be added to the test fuel.</P>
              <P>(iii) To certify a detergent specifically for use in gasoline blended with a specified oxygenate compound other than ethanol, the specified oxygenate must be added to the test fuel in an amount such that the finished fuel contains the oxygenate at the highest concentration at which the specific oxygenate may be used in in-use gasoline.</P>
              <P>(3) No detergent-active substance other than the detergent additive package undergoing testing may be added to a certification test fuel. Typical nondetergent additives, such as antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, and metal deactivators, may be present in the test fuel at the discretion of the additive certifier. In addition, any nondetergent additives (other than oxygenate compounds) which are commonly blended into gasoline and which are known or suspected to affect IVD or PFID formation, or to reduce the ability of the detergent in question to control such deposits, should be added to the test fuel for certification testing.</P>
              <P>(4) Certification test requirements may be satisfied for a detergent additive using more than one batch of test fuel, provided that each batch satisfies all applicable test fuel requirements under this section.</P>

              <P>(5) Unless otherwise required by this section, finished test fuels must conform to the requirements for commercial gasoline described in ASTM D 4814-95c, “Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel”, which is incorporated by reference. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fuel-specific certification test fuels.</E> (1) Test fuels required for fuel-specific certification must contain levels of each of the four basic fuel parameters (aromatics, olefins, T-90, and fuel sulfur) at no less than their respective 65th percentile values in the segregated gasoline pool for which the detergent certification is sought in accordance with § 80.163(c). These values must be determined by the certifier as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) At least once monthly for at least one complete year prior to the certification, the certifier must measure the levels of the required parameters in representative fuel samples contributed to the segregated gasoline pool by each participating refinery, terminal, or other fuel production or distribution facility. The fuel parameters must be measured in accordance with the test procedures in § 80.46. If the applicability of the fuel-specific certification is to be limited to premium gasoline, then the required fuel compositional data must be collected only from samples of premium gasoline.</P>
              <P>(ii) The fuel composition survey results, weighted according to the percentage of gasoline contributed to the segregated gasoline pool from each participating facility, shall be used to construct a percentile distribution of the measured values for each of the fuel parameters.</P>
              <P>(iii) Data from more than one year may be used to construct the required statistical distribution provided that only the total data from complete consecutive years is used and that all survey data must have been collected within three years of the date the certification information is submitted to EPA.</P>
              <P>(iv) At the discretion of the certifier, other fuel parameters may be used to define the certification test fuels in addition to the four required parameters. To be taken into account by EPA in case of confirmatory testing pursuant to § 80.167, such additional parameters must be surveyed and analyzed according to the same requirements applicable to the four standard parameters. In addition, any optional parameters must be measured using test procedures which conform to reasonable and customary standards of repeatability and reproducibility, and reasonable and customary limits of detection and accuracy for the type of test procedure or analytic procedure in question.</P>
              <P>(v) Using the percentile distributions calculated from the survey data for the four required parameters and any additional discretionary parameters, the 65th percentile value for each such parameter shall be determined. Prior to the addition of any oxygenate compound, the fuel-specific certification test fuel shall contain each specified parameter at a level or concentration no less than this 65th percentile value. Test fuel oxygenate requirements for generic, nonoxygenate, and oxygenate-specific certification suboptions are specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Fuel-specific certification test fuels must either be formulated to specification from the same refinery blend stocks which are normally used to blend the gasolines included in the subject gasoline pool, or drawn from the finished fuel supplies which contribute to this pool of gasoline. Fuel-specific certification test fuels need not undergo an IVD demonstration test prior to use in certification testing.</P>
              <P>(3) The certifier must submit an annual report to EPA within 30 days of the anniversary of the initial certification effective date. Failure to submit the annual report by the required date will invalidate the fuel-specific certification and may subject the certifier to liability and penalties under §§ 80.169 and 80.172. The purpose of the annual report is to update the information on the composition of the segregated gasoline pool that was characterized by the initial fuel survey.</P>
              <P>(i) For this purpose, the same fuel survey and statistical analysis requirements that were conducted pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(i),(ii), and (iv) of this section must be repeated, using data for the most current twelve-month period from each of the production/distribution facilities that contributed to the original fuel survey.</P>

              <P>(ii) The annual report must present the percentile distributions for each fuel parameter as determined from the new survey data and, for each measured fuel parameter, must compare the newly determined 50th percentile value with the 60th percentile value for that <PRTPAGE P="235"/>parameter as determined in the original fuel survey.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the new 50th percentile level for any fuel parameter is greater than or equal to the 60th percentile level reported in the initial certification, then the fuel-specific certification is no longer valid. In such instance, the certifier must immediately discontinue the sale and use of the subject detergent under the conditions of the fuel-specific certification and must immediately notify any downstream customers/recipients of the subject detergent that the certification is no longer valid and that their use of the detergent must discontinue within seven days. To avoid liability and penalties under §§ 80.169 and 80.172, the certifier must take these remedial steps within 45 days of the anniversary of the original fuel-specific certification. Downstream customers/recipients must discontinue usage of the detergent within seven days of receipt of notification of the detergent's invalidity to avoid such liability.</P>
              <P>(4) The fuel composition survey results which support the original test fuel specifications and the annual statistical analyses, along with related documentation on test methods and statistical procedures, shall be retained by the certifier for a period of at least five years, and shall be made available to EPA upon request.</P>

Port and throttle body fuel injector deposit control test data will also be considered to be adequate demonstration of an additive's ability to control carburetor deposits. Examples of acceptable test procedures for demonstration of carburetor deposit control, in addition to the fuel injector test procedure listed in § 80.165(a), are contained in the following references:</P>

              <P>(3) The composition of the test fuel used in carburetor deposit control testing, conducted to support the claimed effectiveness of detergents used in leaded gasoline, should be reasonably typical of in-use gasoline in its tendency to form carburetor deposits (or more severe than typical in-use fuels) as defined by the olefin and sulfur content. A test fuel conforming to these compositional guidelines may be sampled directly from finished gasolines or may be blended to specification using typical refinery blend stocks. Test data using leaded fuels is preferred for this purpose, but data collected using unleaded fuels may also be acceptable provided that some correlation with additive performance in leaded fuels is available.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Confirmatory testing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>EPA may test a detergent to confirm that the required performance levels are met. Based on the findings of this confirmatory testing, a detergent certification may be denied or revoked under the provisions of § 80.161(e).</P>
              <P>(a) Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of detergent certifications under the national, PADD, or fuel-specific options under §§ 80.163(a)(1) and 80.163(b) through (d) will generally entail a single vehicle test using the procedures detailed in § 80.165. The test fuel(s) used in conducting such confirmatory certification testing will contain the specified fuel parameters at or below the minimum levels specified in § 80.164, and will otherwise conform to the applicable certification test fuel specifications therein. Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of detergent certifications under the alternative national generic certification option in § 80.163(a)(1)(iii) will generally entail a single test using the procedures detailed in § 80.177. The test fuel(s) used in conducting such confirmatory certification testing will contain the specified fuel parameters at or below the minimum levels specified in § 80.177, and will otherwise conform to the applicable certification test fuel specifications therein.</P>
              <P>(b) Confirmatory certification testing conducted to evaluate the validity of CARB-based detergent certifications will use the subject detergent in test fuel(s) containing the relevant fuel parameters at levels no greater than the maximum levels for which the CARB certification was granted. The test procedures will be conducted pursuant to the procedures specified under section 2257 of Title 13, California Code of Regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of registration and certification information specific to detergent use in leaded gasoline will use the subject detergent in a test fuel containing the test fuel parameters at levels no greater than those prescribed in § 80.164. EPA will make all reasonable efforts to use the same test procedure for confirmatory testing purposes as was used by the certifier in conducting deposit control performance testing.</P>
              <P>(d) When EPA decides to conduct confirmatory testing on a fuel or additive which is not readily available in the open market, EPA may request that the detergent certifier and/or manufacturer of such fuel or additive furnish a sample in the needed quantity. If testing is conducted to evaluate the validity of a detergent certification under the fuel-specific option, the detergent blender must supply EPA with test fuel, or with blend stocks with which to formulate such test fuel, in sufficient quantity to conduct the specified deposit control performance testing. The fuel or additive manufacturer shall comply with a sample request made pursuant to this paragraph within 30 days of receipt of the request.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The following materials:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Documentation for the batch in question, showing that its measured viscosity, density, and basic nitrogen content, or any other such physical parameter(s) which EPA may have approved for monitoring production quality control, were within the acceptable range of production values specified in the certification pursuant to § 80.162(e); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) If the detergent registration identifies polymeric component(s) of the detergent package as the product(s) of other chemical reactants, documentation that the reagents used to synthesize the detergent batch in question were the same as those specified in the registration and that they met the manufacturer's normal acceptance criteria reported pursuant to § 80.162(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Detergent manufacturer causation liability.</E> In any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for a violation of § 80.168, and the manufacturer establishes an affirmative defense to such liability pursuant to § 80.169(c)(4)(i), the detergent manufacturer will nonetheless be deemed liable for the violation of § 80.168 if EPA can demonstrate, by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the detergent manufacturer caused the violation.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Defense against liability where more than one party may be liable for VAR violations.</E> In any case in which a party is presumptively or vicariously liable for a violation of § 80.170, except for the VAR record requirements pursuant to § 80.170(g), such party shall not be deemed liable if it can establish the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Prior to the violation it had entered into a written contract with another potentially liable detergent blender party (“the assuming party”), under which that other party assumed legal responsibility for fulfilling the VAR requirement that had been violated;</P>
              <P>(ii) The contract included reasonable oversight provision to ensure that the assuming party fulfilled its VAR responsibilities (including, but not limited to, periodic review of VAR records) and the oversight provision was actually implemented by the party raising the defense;</P>
              <P>(iii) The assuming party is fiscally sound and able to pay its penalty for the VAR violation; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The employees or agents of the party raising the defense did not cause the violation.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Defense to liability for gasoline non-conformity violations caused solely by the addition of misadditized ethanol or other PRC to the gasoline.</E> In any case in which a party is presumptively or vicariously liable for a gasoline non-conformity violation of § 80.168(a) caused solely by another party's addition of misadditized ethanol or other PRC to the gasoline, the former party shall not be deemed liable for the violation, provided that it can establish that it has fulfilled the defense requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Detergent tank transitioning defenses.</E> The commingling of two detergents in the same detergent storage tank will not be deemed to violate or cause violations of any of the provisions of this subpart, provided the following conditions are met:</P>

              <P>(i) The commingling must occur during a legitimate detergent transitioning event, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> a shift from the use of one detergent to another through the delivery of the new detergent into the same tank that contains the original detergent; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Any use restrictions applicable to the new detergent's certification also apply to the combined detergents; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The commingling event must be documented, either on the VAR formula record or on attached supporting records; and</P>

              <P>(iv) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in § 80.170, a VAR formula record must be created for the combined detergents. The VAR compliance period must begin no later than the <PRTPAGE P="243"/>time of the commingling event. However, at the blender's option, the compliance period may begin earlier, thus including use of the uncombined original detergent within the same period, provided that the 31-day limitation pursuant to § 80.170(a)(6) is not exceeded; and</P>
              <P>(v) The VAR formula record must also satisfy the requirements in one of the following paragraphs (c)(7)(v) (A) through (C) of this section, whichever applies to the commingling event. If neither paragraph (c)(7)(v) (A) nor (B) of this section initially applies, then the blender may drain and subsequently redeliver the original detergent into the tank in restricted amounts, in order to meet the conditions of paragraph (c)(7)(v) (A) or (B) of this section. Otherwise, the blender must comply with paragraph (c)(7)(v)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) If both detergents have the same LAC, and the original detergent accounts for no more than 20 percent of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent.</P>
              <P>(B) If the two detergents have different LACs and the original detergent accounts for 10 percent or less of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent, and must attain the LAC of the new detergent. If the original detergent's LAC is greater than that of the new detergent, then the compliance period may begin earlier than the date of the commingling event (pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section) only if the original detergent does not exceed 10 percent of the total detergent used during the compliance period.</P>
              <P>(C) If neither of the preceding paragraphs (c)(7)(v) (A) or (B) of this section applies, then the VAR formula record must identify both of the commingled detergents, and must use and attain the higher LAC of the two detergents. Once the commingled detergent has been depleted by an amount equal to the volume of the original detergent in the tank at the time the new detergent was added, subsequent VAR formula records must identify and use the LAC of only the new detergent.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Transition from noncertified to certified detergent.</E> Notwithstanding the prohibitions in §§ 80.161(a)(3) and 80.168, after June 30, 1997, the addition to gasoline or PRC of a detergent which has not been certified pursuant to § 80.161 shall not be deemed to violate or cause violations of provisions of this subpart, provided that all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The detergent was received by the detergent blender prior to July 1, 1997 and is used prior to January 1, 1998. Documentation which supports these dates must be maintained for at least five years and must be available for EPA's inspection upon request;</P>
              <P>(ii) The detergent is added to gasoline or PRC only in combination with a certified detergent and, at any one time, accounts for no more than 10 percent of the detergent tank's delivered volume;</P>
              <P>(iii) The total volume of detergent added to the gasoline or PRC is sufficient to attain the LAC of the certified detergent; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Use restrictions associated with the certified detergent are adhered to.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Procedures for curing use restrictions.</E> In the case of a fuel product which has been additized with a detergent under the conditions of a use-restricted certification (pursuant to § 80.163), the use restriction can be negated (“cured”) by application of the procedures in this paragraph (c)(9). A party shall not be liable for violations of § 80.168(a) or (e) caused solely by the additization or subsequent use of gasoline or PRC in violation of such use restriction, provided that the following steps and conditions are applied before EPA has identified the nonconformity and prior to the sale or transfer of nonconforming product to the ultimate consumer:</P>

              <P>(i) Additional detergent must be added in sufficient quantity to provide effective deposit control, taking into account both the amount of detergent previously added and the final anticipated volume and composition of the subject fuel product.<PRTPAGE P="244"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The additional detergent may be either the original detergent or a different detergent, so long as the additional detergent has been separately certified both for use with the subject fuel product and for use with the type of fuel product associated with the restriction which the party wishes to negate by the curing procedure. Detergents which have not been separately certified for both types of fuel products are not eligible to be used for this curing procedure.</P>

              <P>(iii) If a fuel product has been detergent additized under the conditions of a use-restricted certification which would preclude the addition of an oxygenate or other PRC, then such oxygenate or other PRC may nevertheless be added to that fuel product under this curing procedure, provided that additional eligible detergent is added, in an amount which equals or exceeds the number of gallons (D<E T="52">A</E>) derived from the following equation:

              <SUBJECT>Volumetric additive reconciliation (VAR), equipment calibration, and recordkeeping requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This section contains requirements for automated detergent blending facilities and hand-blending detergent facilities. All gasoline and all PRC intended for use in gasoline must be additized unless otherwise noted in supporting VAR records, and must be accounted for in VAR records. The VAR reconciliation standard is attained under this section when the actual concentration of detergent used per VAR formula record equals or exceeds the applicable LAC certified for that detergent pursuant to § 80.161(b)(3)(ix) or, if appropriate, § 80.161(d). If a given detergent package has been certified under more than one certification option pursuant to § 80.163, then a separate VAR formula record must be created for gasoline or PRC additized on the basis of each certification and its respective LAC. In such cases, the amount of the detergent used under different certification options must be accurately and separately measured, either through the use of a separate storage tank, a separate meter, or some other measurement system that is able to accurately distinguish its use. Recorded volumes of gasoline, detergent, and PRC must be expressed to the nearest gallon (or smaller units), except that detergent volumes of five gallons or less must be expressed to the nearest tenth of a gallon (or smaller units). However, if the blender's equipment cannot accurately measure to the nearest tenth of a gallon, then such volumes must be rounded downward to the next lower gallon. PRC included in the reconciliation must be identified. Each VAR formula <PRTPAGE P="245"/>record must also contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Automated blending facilities.</E> In the case of an automated detergent blending facility, for each VAR period, for each detergent storage system and each detergent in that storage system, the following must be recorded:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the detergent additive package being reconciled, the LAC, and any use restriction applicable to the LAC. The LAC must be expressed in terms of gallons of detergent per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, and expressed to four digits. If the detergent storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.</P>
              <P>(2) The total volume of detergent blended into gasoline and PRC, in accordance with one of the following paragraphs (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(i) For a facility which uses in-line meters to measure detergent usage, the total volume of detergent measured, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter readings for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.</P>

              <P>(ii) For a facility which uses a gauge to measure the inventory of the detergent storage tank, the total volume of detergent shall be calculated from the following equation:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Detergent Volume = (A) − (B) + (C) − (D)</FP>
              
              <EXTRACT>
                <FP>where:</FP>
                
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">A = Initial detergent inventory of the tank</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">B = Final detergent inventory of the tank</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">C = Sum of any additions to detergent inventory</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D = Sum of any withdrawals from detergent inventory for purposes other than the additization of gasoline or PRC.</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <FP>The value of each variable in this equation must be separately recorded on the VAR formula record. In addition, a list of each detergent addition included in variable C and a list of each detergent withdrawal included in variable D must be provided, either on the formula record or as VAR supporting documentation.</FP>
              <P>(3) The total volume of gasoline plus PRC to which detergent has been added, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter measurements for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. If gasoline has intentionally been overadditized in anticipation of the later addition of unadditized PRC, then the total volume of gasoline plus PRC recorded must include the expected amount of unadditized PRC to be added later. In addition, the amount of gasoline which was overadditized for this purpose must be specified.</P>
              <P>(4) The actual detergent concentration, calculated as the total volume of detergent added (pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section), divided by the total volume of gasoline plus PRC (pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four digits.</P>
              <P>(5) A list of each detergent concentration rate initially set for the detergent that is the subject of the VAR record, together with the date and description of each adjustment to any initially set concentration. The concentration adjustment information may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. No concentration setting is permitted below the applicable certified LAC, except as may be modified pursuant to § 80.161(d) or as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</P>

              <P>(6) The dates of the VAR period, which shall be no longer than thirty-one days. If the VAR period is contemporaneous with a calendar month, then specifying the month will fulfill this <PRTPAGE P="246"/>requirement; if not, then the beginning and ending dates and times of the VAR period must be listed. The times may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in supporting documentation. Any adjustment to any detergent concentration rate more than 10 percent over the concentration rate initially set in the VAR period shall terminate that VAR period and initiate a new VAR period, except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) The concentration setting for a detergent injector may be set below the applicable LAC, or it may be adjusted more than 10 percent above the concentration initially set in the VAR period without terminating that VAR period, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The purpose of the change is to correct a batch misadditization prior to the end of the VAR period and prior to the transfer of the batch to another party, or to correct an equipment malfunction; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The concentration is immediately returned after the correction to a concentration that fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (a) (5) and (6) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The blender creates and maintains documentation establishing the date and adjustments of the correction; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If the correction is initiated only to rectify an equipment malfunction, and the amount of detergent used in this procedure is not added to gasoline within the compliance period, then this amount is subtracted from the detergent volume listed on the VAR formula record.</P>
              <P>(8) If unadditized gasoline has been transferred from the facility, other than bulk transfers from refineries or pipelines to non-retail outlets or non-WPC facilities, the total amount of such gasoline must be specified.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-automated facilities.</E> In the case of a facility in which hand blending or any other non-automated method is used to blend detergent, for each detergent and for each batch of gasoline and each batch of PRC to which the detergent is being added, the following shall be recorded:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the detergent additive package being reconciled, the LAC, and any use restriction applicable to the LAC. The LAC must be expressed in terms of gallons of detergent per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, and expressed to four digits.</P>
              <P>(2) The date of the additization that is the subject of the VAR formula record.</P>
              <P>(3) The volume of added detergent.</P>
              <P>(4) The volume of the gasoline and/or PRC to which the detergent has been added. If gasoline has intentionally been overadditized in anticipation of the later addition of unadditized PRC, then the total volume of gasoline plus PRC recorded must include the expected amount of unadditized PRC to be added later. In addition, the amount of gasoline which was overadditized for this purpose must be specified.</P>
              <P>(5) The brand (if known), grade, and leaded/unleaded status of gasoline, and/or the type of PRC.</P>
              <P>(6) The actual detergent concentration, calculated as the volume of added detergent (pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section), divided by the volume of gasoline and/or PRC (pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four digits.</P>
              <P>(c) Every VAR formula record created pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall contain the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The signature of the creator of the VAR record;</P>
              <P>(2) The date of the creation of the VAR record; and</P>
              <P>(3) A certification of correctness by the creator of the VAR record.</P>
              <P>(d) Electronically-generated VAR formula and supporting records.</P>

              <P>(1) Electronically-generated records are acceptable for VAR formula records and supporting documentation (including PTDs), provided that they are complete, accessible, and easily readable. VAR formula records must also be stored with access and audit security, which must restrict to a limited number of specified people those who have the ability to alter or delete the records. In addition, parties maintaining records electronically must make available to EPA the hardware and software necessary to review the records.<PRTPAGE P="247"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Electronically-generated VAR formula records may use an electronic user identification code to satisfy the signature requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The use of the ID is limited to the record creator; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A paper record is maintained, which is signed and dated by the VAR formula record creator, acknowledging that the use of that particular user ID on a VAR formula record is equivalent to his/her signature on the document.</P>
              <P>(e) Automated detergent blenders must calibrate their detergent equipment once in each calendar half year, with the acceptable calibrations being no less than one hundred twenty days apart. Equipment recalibration is also required each time the detergent package is changed, unless written documentation indicates that the new detergent package has the same viscosity as the previous detergent package. Detergent package change calibrations may be used to satisfy the semiannual requirement provided that the calibrations occur in the appropriate half calendar year and are no less than one hundred twenty days apart.</P>
              <P>(f) The following VAR supporting documentation must also be created and maintained:</P>
              <P>(1) For all automated detergent blending facilities, documentation reflecting performance of the calibrations required by paragraph (e) of this section, and any associated adjustments of the automated detergent equipment;</P>
              <P>(2) For all hand-blending facilities which are terminals, a record specifying, for each VAR period, the total volume in gallons of transfers from the facility of unadditized base gasoline;</P>
              <P>(3) For all detergent blending facilities, product transfer documents for all gasoline, detergent and detergent-additized PRC transferred into or out of the facility; in addition, bills of lading, transfer, or sale for all unadditized PRC transferred into the facility;</P>
              <P>(4) For all automated detergent blending facilities, documentation establishing the brands (if known) and grades of the gasoline which is the subject of the VAR formula record; and</P>
              <P>(5) For all hand blending detergent blenders, the documentation, if in the party's possession, supporting the volumes of gasoline, PRC, and detergent reported on the VAR formula record.</P>
              <P>(6) For all detergent blending facilities, documentation establishing the curing of a batch or amount of misadditized gasoline or PRC, or the curing of a use restriction on the additized gasoline or PRC, and providing at least the following information: the date of the curing procedure; the problem that was corrected; the amount, name, and LAC of the original detergent used; the amount, name, and LAC of the added curing detergent; and the actual detergent concentration attained in, and the volume of, the total cured product.</P>
              <P>(g) Document retention and availability. All detergent blenders shall retain the documents required under this section for a period of five years from the date the VAR formula records and supporting documentation are created, and shall deliver them upon request to the EPA Administrator or the Administrator's authorized representative.</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, automated detergent blender facilities and hand-blender facilities which are terminals, which physically blend detergent into gasoline, must make immediately available to EPA, upon request, the preceding twelve months of VAR formula records plus the preceding two months of VAR supporting documentation.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, other hand-blending detergent facilities which physically blend detergent into gasoline must make immediately available to EPA, upon request, the preceding two months of VAR formula records and VAR supporting documentation.</P>
              <P>(3) Facilities which have centrally maintained records at other locations, or have customers who maintain their own records at other locations for their proprietary detergent systems, and which can document this fact to the Agency, may have until the start of the next business day after the EPA request to supply VAR supporting documentation, or longer if approved by the Agency.</P>
              <P>(4) In this paragraph (g) of this section, the term <E T="03">immediately available</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="248"/>means that the records must be provided, electronically or otherwise, within approximately one hour of EPA's request, or within a longer time frame as approved by EPA.</P>

              <P>(1) The name and address of the transferee and transferor; the address requirement may be fulfilled, in the alternative, through separate documentation which establishes said addresses and is maintained by the parties and made available to EPA for the same length of time as required for the PTDs, provided that the normal business procedure of these parties is not to identify addresses on PTDs.</P>
              <P>(2) The date of the transfer.</P>
              <P>(3) The volume of product transferred.</P>

              <P>(4)(i) The identity of the product being transferred (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> its identity as base gasoline, detergent, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized oxygenate or detergent-additized gasoline blending stock that comprises a detergent-additized PRC). PTDs for detergent-additized gasoline or PRC are not required to identify the particular detergent used to additize the product.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the product being transferred consists of two or more different types of product subject to this regulation, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> base gasoline, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized PRC, component, then the PTD for the commingled product must identify each such type of component contained in the commingled product.</P>
              <P>(5) If the product being transferred is base gasoline, then in addition to the base gasoline identification, the following warning must be stated on the PTD: “Not for sale to the ultimate consumer”. If, pursuant to § 80.173(a), the product being transferred is exempt base gasoline to be used for research, development, or test purposes only, the following warning must also be stated on the PTD: “For use in research, development, and test programs only”.</P>
              <P>(6) The name of the detergent additive as reported in its registration must be used to identify the detergent package on its PTD.</P>
              <P>(7) If the product being transferred is leaded gasoline, then the PTD must disclose that the product contains lead and/or phosphorous, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(8) If the product being transferred is gasoline or PRC that has been additized with detergent under a PADD-specific or CARB-based certification, or under a certification option which creates an oxygenate or PRC use restriction, then the PTD for the additized product must identify the applicable use restriction. The PTD for commingled additized gasolines or PRCs containing such restrictions must indicate the applicable restriction(s) from each component.</P>
              <P>(9) If the product being transferred is detergent-additized gasoline or PRC that has been overadditized in anticipation of the later (or earlier) addition of PRC, then the PTD must include a statement that the product has been overadditized to account for a specified volume in gallons, or a specified percentage of the product's total volume, of additional, specified PRC.</P>
              <P>(10) If a detergent package has been certified under only one certification option, and that option places a use restriction on the respective LAC, then the PTD must identify the detergent as use-restricted; the PTD for a detergent package certified with more than one LAC must identify that the detergent has special use options available.</P>
              <P>(11) Base gasoline designated for fuel-specific certification.</P>

              <P>(i) The PTD for segregated base gasoline intended for additization with a <PRTPAGE P="249"/>specific fuel-specific detergent pursuant to § 80.163(c) must indicate that it is for use with the designated, fuel-specific detergent.</P>
              <P>(ii) A PTD for base gasoline may not indicate that the product is for use with a designated, fuel-specific detergent, unless the entire quantity of base gasoline is from the segregated fuel supply specified in the detergent's certification and the gasoline contains only those oxygenates or PRCs, if any, specified and approved in the detergent's certification.</P>
              <P>(iii) If, pursuant to § 80.163(c)(3), the fuel-specific certification for the segregated pool of gasoline has established that no detergent additives are necessary for such gasoline to comply with this subpart, then the PTD must identify this gasoline as detergent-equivalent gasoline.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of product codes and other non-regulatory language.</E> (1) Product codes and other non-regulatory language may not be used as a substitute for the specified PTD warning language specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for base gasoline, except that:</P>
              <P>(i) The specified warning language may be omitted for bulk transfers of base gasoline from a refinery to a pipeline if there is a prior written agreement between the parties specifying that all such gasoline is unadditized and will not be transferred to the ultimate consumer;</P>
              <P>(ii) Product codes may be used as a substitute for the specified warning language provided that the PTD is an electronic data interchange (EDI) document being used solely for the transfer of title to the base gasoline, and provided that the product codes otherwise comply with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Product codes and other non-regulatory language may not be used in place of the PTD language specified in paragraph (a)(11) of this section regarding detergent package use restrictions.</P>
              <P>(3) Product codes and other language not specified in this section may otherwise be used to comply with PTD information requirements, provided that they are clear, accurate, and not misleading.</P>
              <P>(4) If product codes are used, they must be standardized throughout the distribution system in which they are used, and downstream parties must be informed of their full meaning.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PTD exemption for small transfers of additized gasoline.</E> Transfers of additized gasoline are exempt from the PTD requirements of this section provided all the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(1) The product is being transferred by a distributor who is not the product's detergent blender; and</P>
              <P>(2) The recipient is a wholesale purchaser-consumer (WPC) or other ultimate consumer of gasoline, for its own use only or for that of its agents or employees; and</P>
              <P>(3) The volume of additized gasoline being transferred is no greater than 550 gallons.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Recordkeeping Period.</E> Any person creating, providing or acquiring product transfer documentation for gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC shall retain the documents required by this section for a period of five years from the date the product transfer documentation was created, received or transferred, as applicable, and shall deliver such documents to EPA upon request. WPCs are not required to retain PTDs of additized gasoline received by them.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) Tests conducted for the intake valve deposit demonstration test pursuant to § 80.177(b)(4) and to demonstrate compliance with the intake valve deposit control standards in this section must be conducted using the same engine block and cylinder head.</P>
              <P>(2) All results must be derived from operationally valid tests in accordance with the test validation criteria of ASTM D6201.</P>
              <P>(3) Test results shall be reported for individual intake valves and as an average of all intake valves.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fuel injector deposit test procedure</E>—(1) <E T="03">Summary of test procedure.</E> After flushing the vehicle fuel system with the fuel to be tested and installing new injectors, an automatic starter control system starts the vehicle and lets it idle for five minutes. The engine is then shut off and allowed to soak for 25 minutes. This cycle is repeated for a total of 192 cycles (96 hours). During this time, the engine is kept at operating temperature with block heaters. After the 96 hours of start/soak cycles, the engine is allowed to hot-soak for 48 hours, during which time the engine is not started but is maintained at operating temperature. At the end of the 48-hour hot soak, the block heaters are turned off and the engine is allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. At the end of this 48-hour ambient temperature soak, an injector balance test is conducted to determine whether any poppet nozzles are stuck closed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Facilities and equipment</E>—(i) <E T="03">Location.</E> A temperature-controlled garage or large room is needed. A dynamometer is not needed, since this test is an idle test. The room temperature shall be maintained in the range of 68-75 °F. The room shall be equipped with an exhaust system that connects to the vehicle tail pipe to remove the exhaust gases from the building. It is recommended that an interlock be provided so that if the building exhaust system fails, the vehicle test will shut down.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Electrical power.</E> Two 110-volt, 15-amp circuits are needed (20-amp circuits are recommended) to operate the four block heaters and a battery charger.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Fuel drain facility.</E> A facility is required to drain the fuel from the vehicle between tests. The fuel is drained from the service port on the fuel rail, near the back of the engine. A commercial cart equipped with a tank and a suction pump is recommended for this operation.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Vehicle.</E> A Chevrolet Astro or GMC Safari van, model year 1998-2001, shall be used for the test. Either two-wheel drive or all-wheel drive is satisfactory, although the former allows easier installation of the block heaters.<PRTPAGE P="253"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Injectors.</E> New injectors, General Motors part number 17091432, shall be used for each test.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Block heaters.</E> Four block heaters, General Motors part number 12371293, are needed for each vehicle. Two heaters shall be installed on each side of the engine, in the freeze plug locations.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Battery charger.</E> Because of the large number of starts and the very short engine running time, a battery charger is needed. It is recommended that the charger be installed permanently on the vehicle and remain plugged in while the test is in progress.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Starter controller.</E> A system is needed to start the engine automatically and then shut it off after exactly five minutes of running. A commercial after-market remote starting system connected to a timer or computer can be used, or a one-of-a-kind system can be designed and built.</P>
              <P>(ix) <E T="03">Tech 2 analyzer.</E> A General Motors Tech 2 analyzer, part number GM3000094, available from Kent-Moore, shall be used to conduct the injector balance test.</P>
              <P>(x) <E T="03">Fuel pressure gauge.</E> A fuel pressure gauge capable of measuring fuel system pressure to the nearest 1 psi over the range of 45 to 65 psi, shall be used with the Tech 2 analyzer when conducting the injector balance test. A pressure transducer shall not be used.</P>
              <P>(xi) <E T="03">Gaskets.</E> The upper intake manifold gasket and injector body gasket will need to be replaced from time to time as they crack, tear, or wear out from frequent handling during injector replacement.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Initial vehicle preparation</E>—(i) <E T="03">Diagnostics.</E> To help determine whether a vehicle is satisfactory for use in this injector test procedure, a thorough inspection and engine diagnostic test shall be conducted as described in the service manual. Check the cooling system to be sure the coolant looks clean and there are no signs of rust.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Block heaters.</E> Install four electric block heaters, General Motors part number 12371293, in the coolant passages of the engine block, two on each side of the block. The heaters will be plugged into a heater control unit. Two of the heaters will remain on at all times during the first 144 hours of the injector fouling test, while the other two heaters will be turned on and off by the controller as needed to maintain an engine temperature of about 100-102 °C during the soak periods of the test. (The temperature will drop while the engine is running, as the coolant from the radiator circulates through the engine. The temperature should recover to 100-102 °C within about 20 minutes after the engine shuts off.)</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Thermocouples.</E> Install a 1/16-inch Type K thermocouple in a threaded bolt hole on the rear of the right cylinder head. This thermocouple provides the feedback signal to the controller to turn two block heaters on and off. Install another thermocouple in the other hole near the first thermocouple. This second thermocouple provides a signal to an over-temperature safety shut-off on the heater controller. If the engine temperature reaches the set point (110 °C recommended), the heater controller will signal the starter controller to shut down the test.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Fuel system flush.</E> Drain the fuel from the fuel system through the service port on the fuel rail at the back of the engine. Refuel with a non-detergent gasoline containing between 5 and 10 percent ethanol. Drive the vehicle for approximately 100 miles to thoroughly expose all parts of the fuel system to the fuel. The fuel pump and fuel filters should not be replaced unless there is a problem with them or if the vehicle history suggests that replacement would be prudent. If replacement is necessary, the new parts should first be conditioned by recirculating a 10% ethanol-gasoline blend (without deposit control additive) through them for one week.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Oil change.</E> Change the engine oil and oil filter, using oil that meets the manufacturer's recommended service classification and viscosity grade.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Battery charger.</E> Install a battery charger in the vehicle so that it can be plugged in during the test and keep the battery at full charge.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Radiator.</E> Install cardboard or other suitable material on the front of the radiator to block the flow of air through the radiator while the engine is running. This will help minimize the drop in coolant temperature.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Starter controller.</E> Make the necessary changes to the vehicle electrical <PRTPAGE P="254"/>system so that the engine can be started and stopped automatically on a programmed schedule. Install a starter controller or computer and program it to do the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Start the engine and let it run for 5 minutes, and then shut it off and let it hot-soak for 25 minutes.</P>
              <P>(B) Repeat the 5/25 cycle for a total of 192 cycles.</P>
              <P>(C) Allow a 48-hr hot soak during which the engine is not run but the engine temperature is maintained at 100-102 °C.</P>
              <P>(D) Turn off the heaters for 48 hours.</P>
              <P>(E) Continuously count and display the number of cycles that have been completed throughout the test.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Test procedure.</E> The steps described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) though (vi) of this section must be performed by the action described in paragraph (c)(3)(vii) of this section so that the new injectors are exposed only to the new test fuel. Take the following additional steps:</P>
              <P>(i) Drain the fuel from the vehicle.</P>
              <P>(ii) Add approximately 2 gallons of the fuel to be tested.</P>
              <P>(iii) Drive the vehicle for approximately 20 miles at speeds up to approximately 50-60 mph. Approximately every 5 miles, stop the vehicle and moderately accelerate. If the radiator covering is still in place, watch the temperature gauge during the driving and avoid overheating the engine. This step not only flushes the fuel system but also helps remove carbon (if any) from the spark plugs and water from the exhaust system.</P>
              <P>(iv) Drain the fuel from the vehicle and add approximately 1 to 2 gallons of the fuel to be tested.</P>
              <P>(v) Drive the vehicle for approximately 5 miles. Watch the temperature gauge and avoid overheating the engine.</P>
              <P>(vi) Drain the fuel from the vehicle and add approximately 10 gallons of the fuel to be tested. (The test consumes about 7.5 gallons of fuel.)</P>
              <P>(vii) Remove the fuel injectors and install new injectors. Run the engine for a few minutes to be sure it runs properly.</P>
              <P>(viii) Park the vehicle in the location where the test will be run.</P>
              <P>(ix) Connect the vehicle tail pipe to the building exhaust system.</P>
              <P>(x) Depending on the design of the starter control system, remove fuses and relays as necessary and connect the wires from the controller to the vehicle fuse box. Close the hood.</P>
              <P>(xi) Turn on the vehicle ignition switch and the security bypass switch if so equipped.</P>
              <P>(xii) Turn on the heater controller and be sure that it is working.</P>
              <P>(xiii) Turn on the starter controller and the vehicle should start.</P>
              <P>(xiv) Monitor the engine temperature for the first few cycles to be sure it is increasing.</P>
              <P>(xv) At the end of the 192-hour (8-day) test, turn off the ignition switch, starter controller, and heater controller. Return the fuses, relays, and wires to their standard configuration for normal operation of the vehicle.</P>
              <P>(xvi) Connect the Tech 2 analyzer to the ALDL connector under the instrument panel, and connect the fuel pressure gauge to the service port on the fuel rail at the back of the engine.</P>
              <P>(xvii) Conduct the injector balance test by following the instructions on the Tech 2. The injector balance test checks each injector individually to determine whether the poppet nozzle is stuck closed. First, the Tech 2 turns on the fuel pump momentarily to pressurize the fuel system. Then it pulses the injector for a preset interval. If the injector and poppet nozzle are working properly, the fuel system pressure will decrease gradually and smoothly by about 8 to 10 psi during the pulsing. If the pressure does not decrease, or decreases very suddenly but then stops decreasing before the pulsing is done, the poppet is stuck closed. This procedure, beginning with pressurizing the fuel system, is carried out for each injector.</P>

                <P>(1) Refiners with refineries built after January 1, 1999;</P>
                <P>(2) Refiners who exceed the employee or crude oil capacity criteria under § 80.225(a) on January 1, 1999, but who meet these criteria after that date, regardless of whether the reduction in employees or crude capacity is due to operational changes at the refinery or a company sale or reorganization;</P>
                <P>(3) Importers; and</P>
                <P>(4) Refiners who produce gasoline other than by processing crude oil through refinery processing units.</P>

                <P>(b)(1)(i) Refiners who qualify as small under § 80.225 and subsequently cease production of diesel fuel from processing crude oil through refinery processing units, or employ more than 1,500 people or exceed the 155,000 bpcd crude oil capacity limit after January 1, 2004 as a result of merger with or acquisition of or by another entity, are disqualified as small refiners, except this shall not apply in the case of a merger between two previously approved small refiners. If disqualification occurs, the refiner shall notify EPA in writing no <PRTPAGE P="266"/>later than 20 days following this disqualifying event.</P>
                <P>(ii) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, any refiner whose status changes under this paragraph shall meet the applicable standards of § 80.195 within a period of up to 30 months of the disqualifying event for any of its refineries that were previously subject to the small refiner standards of § 80.240(a). However, such period shall not extend beyond December 31, 2007, or, for refineries for which the Administrator has approved an extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.553(c), December 31, 2010.</P>
                <P>(iii) A refiner may apply to EPA for an additional six months to comply with the standards of § 80.195 if more than 30 months will be required for the necessary engineering, permitting, construction, and start-up work to be completed. Such applications must include detailed technical information supporting the need for additional time. EPA will base its decision to approve additional time on the information provided by the refiner and on other relevant information. In no case will EPA extend the compliance date beyond December 31, 2007, or, for refineries for which the Administrator has approved an extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.553(c), December 31, 2010.</P>
                <P>(iv) During the period of time up to 30 months provided under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and any extension provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the refiner may not generate gasoline sulfur credits under § 80.310.</P>
                <P>(2) Any refiner who qualifies as a small refiner under § 80.225 may elect to meet the standards under § 80.195 by notifying EPA in writing no later than November 15 prior to the year that the change will occur. Any refiner whose status changes under this paragraph (b)(2) shall meet the standards under § 80.195 beginning with the first averaging period subsequent to the status change.</P>

An extension will be granted for a refinery for the 2008 averaging period if the small refiner who owns the refinery adequately demonstrates that severe economic hardship would result if compliance with the standards in § 80.195 is required in 2008, or that compliance with the standard in 2008 is not feasible for reasons beyond the refiner's control, and that the refiner has made the best efforts possible to achieve compliance with the national standards by January 1, 2008. Upon reapplication by the refiner, if EPA determines that further relief is appropriate, EPA may grant a further extension through the 2009 averaging period. In no case will a further extension for the 2009 averaging period be granted unless the refiner demonstrates conclusively that it has financing in place and that it will be able to complete construction and meet the national gasoline sulfur <PRTPAGE P="272"/>standards no later than December 31, 2009.</P>
                <P>(b) EPA may request more information, if necessary, for evaluation of the application. If requested information is not submitted within the time specified in EPA's request, or any extensions granted, the application may be denied.</P>
                <P>(c) EPA will notify the refiner of approval or disapproval of hardship extension by letter.</P>
                <P>(1) If approved, EPA will also notify the refiner of the date that full compliance with the standards specified at § 80.195 must be achieved or what interim sulfur levels or schedules apply, if any.</P>
                <P>(2) If disapproved, beginning January 1, 2008, the refinery is subject to the requirements in § 80.195. Refiners who receive an extension for the 2008 averaging period shall meet the standards in § 80.195 beginning on January 1, 2009, unless EPA grants an extension of the hardship relief for an additional year. If such an additional extension is granted, the refiner shall meet the standards in § 80.195 on January 1, 2010.</P>
                <P>(d) Refiners who receive a hardship extension may be required to meet more stringent standards than those which apply to them during 2007, and/or could be required to offset excess sulfur levels. EPA may impose reasonable conditions on an extension, such as requiring segregation of the small refiner's gasoline or requiring the gasoline to be sold for use in older vehicles only.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How can a small refiner obtain an adjustment of its 2004-2007 per-gallon cap standard?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) EPA may in its discretion adjust the small refiner per-gallon cap sulfur standard established for a refinery under § 80.240(a) (the established small refiner per-gallon standard) if the refiner demonstrates that the burden of complying with the established small refiner per-gallon standard would effectively prevent the refiner from participating in the small refiner relief provided in § 80.240. No refiner will be eligible for an adjustment of its established per-gallon standard above 450 ppm. The refinery annual average sulfur standards in § 80.240(a) are not affected by this section.</P>
                <P>(b) A refiner wishing to apply for such an adjustment of its established small refiner per-gallon sulfur standard under § 80.240(a) must send a letter to Gasoline Sulfur Program, U.S. EPA, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, 2000 Traverwood Dr., Ann Arbor, MI 48105 no later than January 1, 2003. Such application must include the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) A detailed description of the nature of the difficulty that the per-gallon cap creates;</P>
                <P>(2) The refiner's proposed adjusted per-gallon cap standard and the proposed duration for the adjustment, including an explanation of how a lower per-gallon cap standard or shorter duration would not address the hardship;</P>
                <P>(3) The refiner's expected actual annual average sulfur level (i.e., prior to the use of any credits or allotments) for each year that the adjustment would be in effect;</P>
                <P>(4) The refiner's estimate of the number of gallons of gasoline it produces that will exceed the established small refiner per-gallon standard under § 80.240(a) for each year that the adjusted per-gallon cap would apply; and</P>
                <P>(5) The number of sulfur credits or allotments that the refiner estimates will be required under paragraph (d) of this section for each year that the adjusted per-gallon cap would apply and a plan for obtaining this number of credits or allotments.</P>
                <P>(6) Other relevant information that EPA requests.</P>
                <P>(c) EPA will evaluate each application for an adjusted per-gallon cap sulfur standard on a case-by-case basis. EPA may impose any reasonable conditions on adjustments granted under this section. EPA may in its discretion set forth the duration of the adjusted per-gallon cap sulfur standard but in no case shall it extend beyond December 31, 2007.</P>
                <P>(d)(1) A small refiner with an adjusted per-gallon sulfur cap standard under paragraph (a) of this section must obtain and use sulfur credits or allotments to offset the amount that the adjusted standard exceeds the established small refiner per-gallon standard under § 80.240(a). The number of sulfur credits or allotments needed for each year that the adjusted per-gallon cap would apply is calculated on a per-batch basis according to paragraph (d)(2) of this section and summed over the averaging period.</P>

                <P>(2) The formula for determining the number of sulfur credits or allotments that such a small refiner is required to use for any batch of gasoline exceeding the established small refiner per-gallon standard under § 80.240(a) is as follows:

                <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the requirements of this section apply beginning January 1, 2004, or January 1 of the first year of allotment or credit generation under § 80.275 or § 80.305, whichever is earlier.</P>
                <P>(3) Prior to January 1, 2004:</P>
                <P>(i) Any refiner may release gasoline from the refinery prior to obtaining the test results required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) Any refiner of conventional gasoline may combine samples of gasoline from more than one batch of gasoline or blendstock prior to analysis and treat such composite sample as one batch of gasoline or blendstock pursuant to the requirements of § 80.101(i)(2).</P>
                <P>(4)(i) Beginning January 1, 2004, any refiner who produces gasoline using computer-controlled in-line blending equipment is exempt from the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section to obtain the test results required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section prior to the gasoline leaving the refinery, provided that the refiner obtains an exemption from this requirement from EPA. To obtain such exemption, the refiner must:</P>
                <P>(A) Have been granted an in-line blending exemption under § 80.65(f)(4); or</P>
                <P>(B) If the refiner has not been granted an exemption under § 80.65(f)(4), submit to EPA all of the information required under § 80.65(f)(4)(i)(A). A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B).</P>
                <P>(ii) Refiners who seek an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section must comply with any request by EPA for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption.</P>

                <P>(iii) Within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a submission under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section, EPA will notify the refiner if the exemption is not approved or of any deficiencies in the refiner's submission, or if any additional information is required or other requirements are included in the exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. In the absence of such notification from EPA, the effective date of an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for refiners who do not hold an exemption under § 80.65(f)(4) is 60 days from EPA's <PRTPAGE P="281"/>receipt of the refiner's submission under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iv) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the refiner's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the sulfur content of the refinery's gasoline production, or if EPA determines that any other circumstances exist which merit modification of the requirements of an exemption, such as advancements in the state of the art for in-line blending measurement which allow for additional control or more accurate monitoring or documentation of sulfur content. If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the refiner's exemption will be void ab initio.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Sampling methods.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, refiners and importers shall sample each batch of gasoline by using one of the following methods:</P>

                <SUBJECT>What standards and requirements apply to refiners producing gasoline by blending blendstocks into previously certified gasoline (PCG)?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Any refiner who produces gasoline by blending blendstock into PCG must meet the requirements of § 80.330 to sample and test every batch of gasoline as follows:</P>
                <P>(1)(i) Sample and test to determine the volume and sulfur content of the PCG prior to blendstock blending.</P>
                <P>(ii) Sample and test to determine the volume and sulfur content of the gasoline subsequent to blendstock blending.</P>
                <P>(iii) Calculate the volume and sulfur content of the blendstock, by subtracting the volume and sulfur content of the PCG from the volume and sulfur content of the gasoline subsequent to blendstock blending. The blendstock is a batch for purposes of compliance calculations and reporting. For purposes of this paragraph (a), compliance with the applicable cap standard under § 80.195(a) shall be determined based on the sulfur content of the gasoline subsequent to blendstock blending.</P>
                <P>(2) In the alternative, a refiner may sample and test each batch of blendstock when received at the refinery to determine the volume and sulfur content, and treat each blendstock receipt as a separate batch for purposes of compliance calculations for the annual average sulfur standard and for reporting. This alternative applies only if every batch of blendstock used at a refinery during an averaging period has a sulfur content that is equal to, or less than, the applicable per-gallon cap standard under §§ 80.195 or 80.216.</P>
                <P>(b) Refiners who blend only butane into PCG may meet the sampling and testing requirements by using sulfur test results of the butane supplier, provided that the following requirements are also met:</P>
                <P>(1) The sulfur content of the butane received from the butane supplier must not exceed the following sulfur standards on a per-gallon basis as follows:</P>
                <P>(i)(A) 120 ppm in 2004;</P>
                <P>(B) 30 ppm from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2016; and</P>
                <P>(C) 10 ppm on or after January 1, 2017.</P>
                <P>(ii) Except that the per-gallon sulfur content of butane blended to PCG that is designated as GPA gasoline shall not exceed 150 ppm from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2006.</P>
                <P>(2) The refiner obtains test results from the butane supplier that demonstrate that the sulfur content of each load of butane supplied does not exceed the applicable per-gallon sulfur standard under paragraph (b)(1) of this section through test results of samples of the butane contained in the storage tank from which the butane blender is supplied.</P>
                <P>(i) Testing for the sulfur content of the butane by the supplier must be subsequent to each receipt of butane into the supplier's storage tank, or the testing must be immediately before transfer of butane to the butane blender.</P>
                <P>(ii) The testing must be performed by the method specified in § 80.46(a)(2) or by the alternative method specified in § 80.46(a)(4).</P>
                <P>(iii) The butane blender must obtain a copy of the butane supplier's test results, at the time of each transfer of butane to the butane blender, that reflect the sulfur content of each load of butane supplied to the butane blender.</P>
                <P>(3) The sulfur content and volume of each batch of gasoline produced is that of the butane the refiner blends into gasoline for purposes of calculating compliance with the standards in §§ 80.195 and 80.216.</P>
                <P>(4) The refiner must conduct a quality assurance program of sampling and testing for each butane supplier that demonstrates the butane sulfur content does not exceed the applicable per-gallon sulfur standard in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The frequency of butane sampling and testing, for each butane supplier, must be one sample for every 500,000 gallons of butane received, or one sample every 3 months, whichever results in more frequent sampling.</P>
                <P>(5) If any of the requirements of this section are not met, in whole or in part, for any butane blended into gasoline, that butane is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur standards in § 80.195 or § 80.216, as applicable.</P>

                <P>(c) The procedures in §§ 80.65(i) and 80.101(g)(9) may be applied for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the sulfur standards under this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="284"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) Refiners who blend only blender-grade pentane into PCG pursuant to the requirements of § 80.85 may meet the sampling and testing requirements by using sulfur test results of the pentane supplier pursuant to the requirements § 80.85, provided that the following requirements are also met:</P>
                <P>(1) The sulfur content and volume of each batch of gasoline produced is that of the blender-grade pentane the refiner blends into gasoline for purposes of calculating compliance with the standards in §§ 80.195 and 80.216.</P>
                <P>(2) If any of the requirements of this section are not met, in whole or in part, for any pentane blended into gasoline, that pentane is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur standards in § 80.85, or § 80.86, § 80.195, § 80.216 as applicable.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What definitions apply for purposes of this subpart?</SUBJECT>
                <P>The definitions of § 80.2 and the following additional definitions apply to this subpart I:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Entity</E> means any refiner, importer, distributor, retailer or wholesale-purchaser consumer of any distillate fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Facility</E> means any place, or series of places, where an entity produces, imports, or maintains custody of any distillate fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) from the time it is received to the time custody is transferred to another entity, except as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section:</P>

                <P>(1) Where an entity maintains custody of a batch of diesel fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) from one place in the distribution system to another place (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> from a pipeline to a terminal), all owned by the same entity, both places combined are considered to be one single aggregated facility, except where an entity chooses to treat components of such an aggregated facility as separate facilities. The choice made to treat these places as separate facilities may not be changed by the entity during any applicable compliance period. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, where compliance requirements depend upon facility-type, the entire facility must comply with the requirements that apply to its components as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) If an aggregated facility includes a refinery, the entire facility must comply with the requirements applicable to refineries.</P>
                <P>(ii) If an aggregated facility includes a truck loading terminal but not a refinery, the entire facility must comply with the requirements applicable to truck loading terminals.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Situations where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal.</E>(A) Where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal, diesel fuel or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I produced by such refinery and distributed over the truck terminal rack must be included in refinery batches that may be based on shipments to a truck terminal rack tank or on the total volumes delivered to tanker trucks for a period not to exceed 1 calendar month per batch.</P>

                <P>(B) Where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal, diesel fuel or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I that were imported or produced by another refinery, and that are distributed through the refinery or truck terminal rack, must be treated as previously designated fuel for which the aggregated facility is responsible for all applicable balance and downgrade requirements under §§ 80.527, 80.598, 80.599 and related recordkeeping and reporting requirements like any other distributor downstream from the refiner or importer.<PRTPAGE P="309"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) A refinery or import facility may not be aggregated with facilities that receive fuel from other refineries or import facilities, either directly or indirectly. For example, a refinery may not be aggregated with a terminal that receives any fuel from a common carrier pipeline. However, a refinery may be aggregated with a pipeline and terminal that are owned by the same entity and which receive no fuel from any source other than the refinery. Likewise, a refinery may not be aggregated with a mobile facility that is also carrying another entity's fuel; it may however be aggregated with a mobile facility that does not receive fuel from any source other than the refinery. If a refinery or import facility is aggregated with other facilities, then the aggregated facility is treated as a refinery or import facility.</P>
                <P>(3) Retail outlets or wholesale purchaser consumers may not be aggregated with any other facility.</P>

                <P>(4) Mobile components and mobile facilities. (i) Where an entity maintains custody of diesel fuel in one or more mobile components (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, rail, barge, shipping, or trucking operations), the mobile components may be aggregated as a single facility. Mobile components may also be aggregated with a facility from which they receive fuel or a facility to which they deliver fuel. However, mobile components may not be aggregated with both a facility from which they receive fuel and a facility to which they deliver fuel.</P>
                <P>(ii) When an entity maintains title to, but not custody of, diesel fuel in one or more mobile components, the entity may treat the mobile component(s) as a facility under this paragraph (b), but only for the fuel to which the entity has title. In the event that title changes while a mobile component is in transport (but the fuel physically remains in the same mobile facility), the original entity that had title to the fuel continues to be responsible for the designate and track requirements until custody of the fuel is transferred from the mobile facility.</P>
                <P>(5) An individual refinery or contiguous pipeline may not be subdivided into more than one facility. An individual terminal may not be subdivided into more than one facility unless approved by the Administrator.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Truck loading terminal</E> means any facility that dyes NRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine fuel, pays taxes on motor vehicle diesel fuel per IRS code (26 CFR part 48), or adds a fuel marker pursuant to § 80.510 to heating oil and delivers diesel fuel or heating oil into trucks for delivery to retail or ultimate consumer locations.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Batch</E> means a quantity of diesel fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) which is homogeneous with regard to those properties that are specified for MVNRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine fuel under this subpart I, has the same designation under this subpart I (if applicable), and whose custody is transferred from one facility to another facility.</P>
                <P>(1) In the case of aggregated facilities consisting of a refinery and a truck loading terminal, a batch may be defined by one of the following methods:</P>
                <P>(i) The sum of the deliveries from the truck loading terminal rack to trucks for periods not to exceed 1 month;</P>
                <P>(ii) Each individual truck or truck compartment; or</P>
                <P>(iii) For refineries with “certification tanks” where testing is performed and “rack tanks” that feed the truck loading terminal rack, each transfer from the certification tank to the rack tank. If this method of determining a batch is selected, it must be the sole method used and must be performed such that no double-counting or undercounting of volumes occurs.</P>
                <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Downstream location</E> means any point in the diesel fuel distribution system that is downstream of refineries and import facilities, for example, diesel fuel at facilities of distributors, carriers, retailers, kerosene blenders, and wholesale purchaser-consumers.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Definition of PADD.</E> For the purposes of this subpart only, the following definitions of PADDs apply:</P>
                <P>(1) The following States are included in PADD I:

                <SUBJECT>May an importer treat diesel fuel as blendstock?</SUBJECT>
                <P>An importer may exclude diesel fuel that it imports from the requirements under this subpart, and instead may designate such diesel fuel as diesel fuel treated as blendstock (DTAB), if all the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(a) The DTAB must be included in all applicable designation, credit and compliance calculations for diesel fuel for a refinery operated by the same entity that is the importer . That entity must meet all refiner standards and requirements.</P>
                <P>(b) The importer entity may not transfer title of the DTAB to another entity until the DTAB has been used to produce diesel fuel and all refiner standards and requirements have been met for the diesel fuel produced.</P>

                <P>(c) The refinery at which the DTAB is used to produce diesel fuel must be <PRTPAGE P="314"/>physically located at either the same terminal at which the DTAB first arrives in the U.S., the import facility, or at a facility to which the DTAB is directly transported from the import facility.</P>
                <P>(d) The DTAB must be completely segregated from any other diesel fuel, including any diesel fuel tank bottoms, prior to the point of blending, sampling and testing in the importer entity's refinery operation. The DTAB may, however, be added to a diesel fuel blending tank where the diesel fuel tank bottom is not included as part of the batch volume for a prior batch. In addition, the DTAB may be placed into a storage tank that contains other DTAB imported by that importer. The DTAB also may be discharged into a tank containing finished diesel fuel of the same category as the diesel fuel which will be produced using the DTAB (for example, 15 ppm sulfur undyed or 15 ppm sulfur dyed diesel fuel) provided the blending process is performed in that same tank.</P>
                <P>(e) The entity must account for the volume of diesel fuel produced using DTAB in a manner that excludes the volume of any previously designated diesel fuel. The diesel fuel tank bottom may not be included in the company's refinery compliance calculations for that batch of diesel fuel if the fuel in that tank bottom has been previously designated by a refiner or importer. This exclusion of previously designated diesel fuel must be accomplished using the following approach:</P>
                <P>(1) Determine the volume of any tank bottom that is previously designated diesel fuel before any diesel fuel production begins.</P>
                <P>(2) Add the DTAB plus any blendstock to the storage tank, and completely mix the tank.</P>
                <P>(3) Determine the volume and sulfur content of the diesel fuel contained in the storage tank after blending is complete. Mathematically subtract the volume of the tank bottom to determine the volume of the DTAB plus blendstock added, and subsequently transferred to another facility. Such fuel is reported to EPA as a batch of diesel fuel under §§ 80.593, 80.601, and 80.604.</P>
                <P>(4) If previously designated motor vehicle diesel fuel having a sulfur content of 15 ppm or less is blended with DTAB, and the combined product after blending has a sulfur content that exceeds 15 ppm, the importer entity, in its capacity as a refiner, must redesignate all the diesel fuel as 500 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel for purposes of the temporary compliance option under § 80.530, or other permissible redesignation under § 80.598. If #2D 15 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel is redesignated as #2D 500 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel, such entity must apply the volume of previously designated 15 ppm sulfur diesel fuel, for purposes of its operations as a distributor, to its downgrading limitation under § 80.527, if applicable, and for volume balancing purposes under § 80.599.</P>
                <P>(5) As an alternative to paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section, where an importer has a blending tank that is used only to combine DTAB and blending components, and no previously designated diesel fuel is added to the tank, the importer entity, in its capacity as a refiner, may account for the diesel fuel produced in such a blending tank by sampling and testing for the sulfur content of the batch after DTAB and blendstock are added and mixed, and reporting the volume of diesel fuel transferred from that tank to a different facility, up to the point where a new blend is produced by adding new DTAB and blendstock.</P>
                <P>(f) The importer must include the volume and sulfur content of each batch of DTAB in the annual importer reports to EPA, as prescribed under §§ 80.593, 80.601, and 80.604, but with a notation that the batch is not included in the importer compliance calculations because the product is DTAB. Any DTAB that ultimately is not used in the importer's refinery operation (for example, a tank bottom of DTAB at the conclusion of the refinery operation), must be treated as newly imported diesel fuel, for which all required sampling and testing, and recordkeeping must be accomplished, and included in the importer's compliance calculations for the averaging period when this sampling and testing occurs.</P>

                <P>(g) The importer must retain records that reflect the importation, sampling <PRTPAGE P="315"/>and testing, and physical movement of any DTAB, and must make these records available to EPA on request.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What provisions apply to transmix processing facilities and pipelines that produce diesel fuel from pipeline interface?</SUBJECT>
                <P>For purposes of this section, transmix means a mixture of finished fuels, such as pipeline interface, that no longer meets the specifications for a fuel that can be used or sold without further processing or handling. For the purposes of this section, pipeline interface means the mixture between different fuels that abut each other during shipment by pipeline. This section applies to refineries (or other facilities) that produce diesel fuel from transmix by distillation or other refining processes but do not produce diesel fuel by processing crude oil and to pipelines that produce diesel fuel from transmix. This section only applies to the volume of diesel fuel produced from transmix by a transmix processor using these processes, and to the diesel fuel volume produced by a pipeline operator from transmix. This section does not apply to any diesel fuel volume produced by the blending of blendstocks.</P>
                <P>(a) From June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010, motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor is subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(c).</P>
                <P>(b) Beginning June 1, 2010, motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor is subject to the sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1).</P>

                <P>(d) From June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2014, NRLM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the standards under § 80.510(a). This paragraph (d) does not apply to NRLM diesel fuel that is sold or intended for sale in the areas listed in § 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2).</P>
                <P>(e) From June 1, 2014 and beyond, NRLM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor and a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the standards of § 80.510(c).</P>
                <P>(f) From February 25, 2013 through May 31, 2014, LM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix that is sold or intended for sale in the area listed in § 80.510(g)(1) is subject to the standards of § 80.510(a) provided that the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section are satisfied. Diesel fuel produced from transmix that does not meet the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section is subject to the sulfur standard in § 80.510(c).</P>
                <P>(g) Beginning June 1, 2014, LM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the sulfur standard of § 80.510(a), provided that the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section are satisfied. Diesel fuel produced from transmix that does not meet the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section is subject to the sulfur standard in § 80.510(c).</P>
                <P>(h) The following conditions must be satisfied to allow the production of 500 ppm LM under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) The fuel must be produced from transmix.</P>

                <P>(2) The fuel must not be sold or intended for sale in the area listed in § 80.510(g)(2) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Alaska).</P>

                <P>(3) A facility producing 500 ppm LM diesel fuel must obtain approval from the Administrator for a compliance plan. The compliance plan must detail how the facility will segregate any 500 ppm LM diesel fuel produced subject to the standards under § 80.510(a) from the producer through to the ultimate consumer from fuel having other designations. The compliance plan must demonstrate that the end users of 500 ppm LM will also have access to 15 ppm diesel fuel for use in those engines that require the use of 15 ppm diesel fuel. The compliance plan must identify the entities that handle the 500 ppm LM through to the ultimate consumer. No more than 4 separate entities shall handle the 500 ppm LM between the producer and the ultimate consumer. <PRTPAGE P="316"/>The compliance plan must also identify all ultimate consumers to whom the refiner supplies the 500 ppm LM diesel fuel.

                <P>(a) A refiner that has been approved by EPA under § 80.217 for the geographic phase-in area (GPA) gasoline sulfur content standards under § 80.216 may apply to EPA for approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA standards in 2007 and 2008. Such application shall be submitted to EPA, at the address provided in § 80.595(b), by December 31, 2001. A foreign refiner must apply under the provisions of paragraph (n) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) The refiner must submit an application in accordance with the provisions of §§ 80.595 and 80.596. The application must also include information, as provided in § 80.594(c), demonstrating that starting no later than June 1, 2006, 95 percent of the motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by the refinery for United States use will comply with the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1), and that the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced will comply with the volume requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) The Administrator may approve a refiner's application to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards in 2007 and 2008 if the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are satisfied. In approving an application, the Administrator shall establish a motor vehicle diesel fuel volume baseline under §§ 80.595 and 80.596.</P>
                <P>(d) From June 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008, 95 percent of the motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a refiner that has been approved under paragraph (c) of this section to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur standards in 2007 and 2008, must be accurately designated under § 80.598 as meeting the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(a)(1).</P>
                <P>(e) The total volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced for use in the United States and designated as meeting the 15 ppm sulfur standard under paragraph (d) of this section must meet or exceed 85 percent of the baseline volume established under paragraph (c) of this section, except that for the first compliance period from June 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007, the total volume must meet or exceed 92 percent of the baseline volume.</P>
                <P>(f) Compliance with the volume requirements in paragraph (e) of this section shall be determined each compliance period. Annual compliance periods shall be from July 1 through June 30. For the year 2006, the compliance period shall be from June 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007.</P>

                <P>(g) If a refiner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, or if the approval of the application, including the baseline, was based on false or inaccurate information, the approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards under this section during the years 2007 and 2008 shall be void ab initio, and gasoline produced for use in the GPA must meet the gasoline sulfur content standards of subpart H of this Part as if there had been no approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards in 2007 and 2008.<PRTPAGE P="330"/>
                </P>
                <P>(h) If for any compliance period a refiner fails to meet the volume requirements in paragraph (e) of this section, the approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards shall be void for that compliance period and for all succeeding compliance periods, and gasoline produced for use in the GPA must meet the gasoline sulfur standards under subpart H of this subpart as if there had been no approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards under this section in 2007 and 2008.</P>
                <P>(i) A refiner that is approved for production of gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur standards under this section in 2007 and 2008 must meet all applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements of §§ 80.592, 80.593, and 80.594, and shall meet all the recordkeeping and reporting requirements under §§ 80.219, 80.365 and 80.370.</P>
                <P>(j) A refiner approved to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur standards under this section in 2007 and 2008 may not generate or use credits under § 80.531(a) or (e), or § 80.532 unless the approval is vacated as provided in paragraph (k) of this section.</P>
                <P>(k) A refiner may petition the Administrator to vacate approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards in 2007 and 2008. EPA may grant such a petition, effective January 1 of the compliance period following EPA's receipt of such petition (or effective June 1, in 2006, if applicable). Upon such effective date and thereafter, gasoline produced for use in the GPA must meet the gasoline sulfur content standards under subpart H of this Part as if there had been no approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards under this section in 2007 and 2008. Upon such effective date, the refiner shall not be subject to the requirements of this section.</P>
                <P>(l) The provisions of this section shall apply separately for each refinery of a refiner.</P>

                <P>(a) Beginning on June 1, 2006 (or earlier pursuant to § 80.531), for motor vehicle diesel fuel, and beginning June 1, 2010 (or earlier pursuant to § 80.535), for NRLM diesel fuel, and beginning June 1, 2014, for ECA marine fuel, each refiner and importer shall collect a representative sample from each batch of motor vehicle or NRLM diesel fuel produced or imported and subject to the 15 ppm sulfur content standard, or ECA marine fuel subject to the 1,000 ppm sulfur content standard. Batch, for the purposes of this section, means batch as defined under § 80.2 but without the reference to transfer of custody from one facility to another facility.</P>

                <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the refiner or importer shall test each sample collected pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to determine its sulfur content for compliance with the requirements of this subpart prior to the diesel fuel leaving the refinery or import facility, using an appropriate sampling and testing method as specified in § 80.580.<PRTPAGE P="346"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c)(1) Any refiner who produces motor vehicle, NRLM diesel fuel, or ECA marine fuel using computer-controlled in-line blending equipment, including the use of an on-line analyzer test method that is approved under the provisions of § 80.580, and who, subsequent to the production of the diesel fuel batch tests a composited sample of the batch under the provisions of § 80.580 for purposes of designation and reporting, is exempt from the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section to obtain the test result required under this section prior to the diesel fuel leaving the refinery, provided that the refiner obtains approval from EPA. The requirement of this paragraph (c)(1) that the in-line blending equipment must include an on-line analyzer test method that is approved under the provisions of § 80.580 is effective beginning June 1, 2006.</P>
                <P>(2) To obtain an exemption from paragraph (b) of this section, the refiner must submit to EPA all the information required under § 80.65(f)(4)(i)(A). A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this paragraph (c)(2).</P>
                <P>(3) Refiners who seek an exemption under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must comply with any request by EPA for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption.</P>
                <P>(4) Within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a submission under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, EPA will notify the refiner if the exemption is not approved or of any deficiencies in the refiner's submission, or if any additional information is required or other requirements are included in the exemption pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In the absence of such notification from EPA, the effective date of an exemption under this paragraph (c) is 60 days from EPA's receipt of the refiner's submission.</P>

                <P>(5) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under this paragraph (c), in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the refiner's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the sulfur content of the refinery's diesel fuel production, or if EPA determines that any other circumstances exist which merit modification of the requirements of an exemption, such as advancements in the state of the art for in-line blending measurement which allow for additional control or more accurate monitoring or documentation of sulfur content. If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the refiner's exemption will be void <E T="03">ab initio.</E>

                <SUBJECT>What alternative sampling and testing requirements apply to importers who transport motor vehicle diesel fuel, NRLM diesel fuel, or ECA marine fuel by truck or rail car?</SUBJECT>

                <P>Importers who import diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(b) or (c) or 80.520(a) into the United States by truck or by rail car may comply with the following requirements instead of the requirements to sample and test each batch of fuel <PRTPAGE P="349"/>designated as subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.581 otherwise applicable to importers:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Terminal testing.</E> For purposes of determining compliance with the 15 ppm sulfur standard, the importer may use test results for sulfur content testing conducted by the foreign truck-loading or rail car-loading terminal operator for diesel fuel contained in the storage tank from which trucks or rail cars used to transport diesel fuel designated as subject to the 15 ppm sulfur content standard into the United States are loaded, provided the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(1) The sampling and testing shall be performed after each receipt of diesel fuel into the storage tank, or immediately before each transfer of diesel fuel to the importer's truck or rail car.</P>
                <P>(2) The sampling and testing shall be performed according to § 80.580.</P>
                <P>(3) At the time of each transfer of diesel fuel to the importer's truck or rail car for import to the U.S., the importer must obtain a copy of the terminal test result that indicates the sulfur content of the truck or rail car load, or truck or rail car compartment load, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality assurance program.</E> The importer must conduct a quality assurance program, as specified in this paragraph (b), for each truck or rail car loading terminal.</P>
                <P>(1) Quality assurance samples must be obtained from the truck-loading or rail car loading terminal and tested by the importer, or by an independent laboratory, and the terminal operator must not know in advance when samples are to be collected.</P>
                <P>(2) The sampling and testing must be performed using the methods specified in § 80.580.</P>
                <P>(3) The frequency of the quality assurance sampling and testing must be at least one sample for each 50 of an importer's trucks or rail cars that are loaded at a terminal, or one sample per month, whichever is more frequent.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Party required to conduct quality assurance testing.</E> The quality assurance program under paragraph (b) of this section shall be conducted by the importer. In the alternative, this testing may be conducted by an independent laboratory that meets the criteria under § 80.65(f)(2)(iii), provided the importer receives copies of all results of tests conducted no later than 21 days after the sample was taken.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative batch designations.</E> For purposes of maintaining batch records under §§ 80.592, 80.600, and 80.602, designation of batches under § 80.598, and reporting under §§ 80.593, 80.601, and 80.604:</P>
                <P>(1) In lieu of treating each portion of a tank truck compartment delivered to a different facility as a different batch, a truck importer may treat each compartment as a batch, if all the fuel in the compartment is delivered only to retail outlets, wholesale purchaser-consumers or other end users. Where different compartments contain homogeneous product of identical designations, the total volume of those compartments may be treated as a single batch, if the entire volume is delivered only to retail outlets, wholesale purchaser-consumers or other ultimate consumers.</P>
                <P>(2) Each portion of a rail car (or rail cars) delivery of a different designation or each delivery to a different facility is considered to be a separate batch.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">EPA inspections of terminals.</E> EPA inspectors or auditors must be given full and immediate access to the truck or rail car-loading terminal and any laboratory at which samples of diesel fuel collected at the terminal are analyzed, and must be allowed to conduct inspections, review records, collect diesel fuel samples and perform audits. These inspections or audits may be either announced or unannounced.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Certified DFR-Diesel.</E> This section does not apply to Certified DFR-Diesel as defined in § 80.620.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Effect of noncompliance.</E> If any of the requirements of this section are not met, all motor vehicle diesel fuel and NRLM diesel fuel imported by the truck or rail car importer during the time the requirements are not met is deemed in violation of the 15 ppm sulfur diesel fuel standards in § 80.510(b) or (c) or § 80.520(a), as applicable. Additionally, if any requirement is not met, EPA may notify the importer of the violation, and, if the requirement is not fulfilled within 10 days of notification, the truck importer may not in the future use the sampling and testing <PRTPAGE P="350"/>provisions in this section in lieu of the provisions in § 80.581.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What are the alternative defense requirements in lieu of § 80.613(a)(1)(vi)?</SUBJECT>
                <P>Any person who blends a MVNRLM diesel fuel additive package into MVNRLM diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standards of § 80.510(b) or (c) or § 80.520(a) which contains a static dissipater additive that has a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm but whose contribution to the sulfur content of the MVNRLM diesel fuel is less than 0.4 ppm at its maximum recommended concentration, and/or red dye that has a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm but whose contribution to the sulfur content of the MVNRLM diesel fuel is less than 0.04 ppm at its maximum recommended concentration, and which contains no other additives with a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm must establish all the following in order to use this section as an alternative to the defense element under § 80.613(a)(1)(vi):</P>
                <P>(a)(1) The blender of the additive package has a sulfur content test result for the MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to blending of the additive package that indicates that the additive package, when added, will not cause the MVNRLM diesel fuel sulfur content to exceed 15 ppm sulfur.</P>
                <P>(2) In cases where the storage tank that contains MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to additization contains multiple fuel batches, the blender of the additive package must have sulfur test results on each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel that was added to the storage tank during the current and previous volumetric accounting reconciliation (VAR) periods, which indicates that the additive package, when added to the component MVNRLM diesel fuel batch in the storage tank with the highest sulfur level would not cause that component batch to exceed 15 ppm sulfur.</P>
                <P>(b) The VAR standard is attained as determined under the provisions of this section. The VAR reconciliation standard is attained when the actual concentration of the additive package used per the VAR formula record under paragraph (f) of this section is less than the concentration that would have caused any batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to exceed a sulfur content of 15 ppm given the maximum sulfur test result on any MVNRLM diesel fuel batch described in paragraph (a) of this section that is additized with the additive package during the VAR period.</P>
                <P>(c) The product transfer document complies with the applicable sulfur information requirements of § 80.591.</P>
                <P>(d) If more than one additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye is used during a VAR period, then a separate VAR formula record must be created for MVNRLM diesel fuel additized for each of the additive packages used. In such cases, the amount of the each additive package used must be accurately and separately measured, either through the use of a separate storage tank, a separate meter, or some other measurement system that is able to accurately distinguish its use.</P>

                <P>(e) Recorded volumes of MVNRLM diesel fuel and the additive package must be expressed to the nearest gallon (or smaller units), except that additive package volumes of five gallons or less must be expressed to the nearest tenth of a gallon (or smaller units). However, if the blender's equipment cannot accurately measure to the nearest tenth of a gallon, then such volumes must be rounded upward to the next higher gallon for purposes of determining compliance with this section.<PRTPAGE P="401"/>
                </P>
                <P>(f) Each VAR formula record must also contain the following information:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Automated blending facilities.</E> In the case of an automated additive package blending facility, for each VAR period, for each storage system for an additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye, and each additive package in that storage system, the following must be recorded:</P>
                <P>(i)(A) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the package being reconciled, the maximum recommended treatment level, the potential contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that might result when the additive package is used at its maximum recommended treatment level, the intended treatment level, and the contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that would result when the additive package is used at its intended treatment level. The intended treatment level is the treatment level that the additive injection equipment is set to.</P>
                <P>(B) The maximum recommended treatment level and the intended treatment level must be expressed in terms of gallons of the additive package per thousand gallons of MVNRLM diesel fuel, and expressed to four significant figures. If the additive package storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.</P>
                <P>(ii) The total volume of the additive package blended into MVNRLM diesel fuel, in accordance with one of the following methods, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(A) For a facility which uses in-line meters to measure usage, the total volume of additive package measured, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter readings for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.</P>

                <P>(B) For a facility which uses a gauge to measure the inventory of the additive package storage tank, the total volume of additive package shall be calculated from the following equation:
                </P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Additive package volume = (A) − (B) + (C) − (D)</FP>

                  <FP SOURCE="FP-2">A = Initial additive package inventory of the tank</FP>
                  <FP SOURCE="FP-2">B = Final additive package inventory of the tank</FP>
                  <FP SOURCE="FP-2">C = Sum of any additions to additive package inventory</FP>
                  <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D = Sum of any withdrawals from additive package inventory for purposes other than the additization of MVNRLM diesel fuel.</FP>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(C) The value of each variable in the equation in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section must be separately recorded on the VAR formula record. In addition, a list of each additive package addition included in variable C and a list of each additive package withdrawal included in variable D must be provided, either on the formula record or as VAR supporting documentation.</P>
                <P>(iii) The total volume of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package has been added, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter measurements for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.</P>
                <P>(iv) The actual concentration of the additive package, calculated as the total volume of the additive package added (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section), divided by the total volume of MVNRLM diesel fuel (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to 4 significant figures.</P>

                <P>(v) A list of each additive package concentration rate set for the additive package that is the subject of the VAR record, together with the date and description of each adjustment to any initially set concentration. The concentration adjustment information may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR <PRTPAGE P="402"/>supporting documentation. No concentration setting is permitted above the maximum recommended concentration supplied by the additive manufacturer, except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(vi) The dates of the VAR period, which shall be no longer than thirty-one days. If the VAR period is contemporaneous with a calendar month, then specifying the month will fulfill this requirement; if not, then the beginning and ending dates and times of the VAR period must be listed. The times may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in supporting documentation. Any adjustment to any additive package concentration rate initially set in the VAR period shall terminate that VAR period and initiate a new VAR period, except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(vii) The concentration setting for the additive package injector may be changed from the concentration initially set in the VAR period without terminating that VAR period, provided that:</P>
                <P>(A) The purpose of the change is to correct a batch under-additization prior to the end of the VAR period and prior to the transfer of the batch to another party, or to correct an equipment malfunction where there has been no over-additization of the additive;</P>
                <P>(B) The concentration is immediately returned after the correction to a concentration that fulfills the requirements of this paragraph (f);</P>
                <P>(C) The blender creates and maintains documentation establishing the date and adjustments of the correction; and</P>
                <P>(D) If the correction is initiated only to rectify an equipment malfunction, and the amount of additive package used in this procedure is not added to MVNRLM diesel fuel within the compliance period, then this amount is subtracted from the additive package volume listed on the VAR formula record. In such a case, the addition of this amount of additive must be reflected in the following VAR period.</P>
                <P>(viii) The measured sulfur level for each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package is added during each VAR period. In cases where the storage tank that contains MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to additization contains multiple fuel batches, a measured sulfur level on each batch added to the storage tank during the current and previous VAR periods must be recorded.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-automated facilities.</E> In the case of a facility in which hand blending or any other non-automated method is used to blend the additive packages, for each additive package and for each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package is being added, the following shall be recorded:</P>
                <P>(i) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the additive package being reconciled, the maximum recommended treatment level, the potential contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that might result when the additive package is used at its maximum recommended treatment level, the intended treatment level, and the contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that would result when the additive package is used at its intended treatment level.</P>
                <P>(A) The maximum recommended treatment level and the intended treatment level must be expressed in terms of gallons of additive package per thousand gallons of MVNRLM diesel fuel, and expressed to four significant figures.</P>
                <P>(B) If the additive package storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.</P>

The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four significant figures.<PRTPAGE P="403"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vii) The measured sulfur level for each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package is added during each VAR period.

                <SUBJECT>What are the additional requirements for diesel fuel or distillates produced by foreign refineries subject to a temporary refiner compliance option, hardship provisions, or motor vehicle or NRLM diesel fuel credit provisions?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) A foreign refinery is a refinery that is located outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively referred to in this section as “the United States”).</P>
                <P>(2) A foreign refiner is a person who meets the definition of refiner under § 80.2(i) for a foreign refinery.</P>
                <P>(3) A diesel fuel program foreign refiner (“DFR”) is a foreign refiner that has been approved by EPA for participation in any motor vehicle diesel fuel or NRLM diesel fuel provision of § 80.530 through 80.533, or §§ 80.535, 80.536, 80.540, 80.552, 80.553, 80.554, 80.560 or 80.561 (collectively referred to as “diesel foreign refiner program”).</P>
                <P>(4) “DFR-Diesel” means diesel fuel or distillate fuel as applicable under subpart I of this part produced at a DFR refinery that is imported into the United States.</P>
                <P>(5) “Non-DFR-Diesel” means diesel fuel or distillate fuel that is produced at a foreign refinery that has not been approved as a DFR foreign refiner, diesel fuel produced at a DFR foreign refinery that is not imported into the United States, and diesel fuel produced at a DFR foreign refinery during a period when the foreign refiner has opted to not participate in the DFR-Diesel foreign refiner program under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>

                <P>(6) “Certified DFR-Diesel” means DFR-Diesel the foreign refiner intends to include in the foreign refinery's compliance calculations under any provisions of § 80.530 through 80.533, or §§ 80.535, 80.536, 80.540, 80.552, 80.553, 80.554, 80.560 or 80.561 and does include <PRTPAGE P="407"/>in these compliance calculations when reported to EPA.</P>
                <P>(7) “Non-Certified DFR-Diesel” means DFR-Diesel fuel that a DFR foreign refiner imports to the United States that is not Certified DFR-Diesel.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Baseline.</E> For any foreign refiner to obtain approval under the diesel foreign refiner program of this subpart for any refinery, it must apply for approval under the applicable provisions of this subpart. To obtain approval the refiner is required, as applicable, to demonstrate a volume baseline under subpart I of this part.</P>
                <P>(1) The refiner shall follow the procedures, applicable to volume baselines and using diesel fuel, or if applicable, heating oil, instead of gasoline, in §§ 80.91 through 80.93 to establish the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel that was produced at the refinery and imported into the United States during the applicable years for purposes of establishing a baseline under Subpart I for applicable fuels produced for use in the United States.</P>
                <P>(2) In making determinations for foreign refinery baselines EPA will consider all information supplied by a foreign refiner, and in addition may rely on any and all appropriate assumptions necessary to make such determinations.</P>
                <P>(3) Where a foreign refiner submits a petition that is incomplete or inadequate to establish an accurate baseline, and the refiner fails to correct this deficiency after a request for more information, EPA will not assign an individual refinery baseline.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">General requirements for DFR foreign refiners.</E> A foreign refiner of a refinery that is approved under the diesel foreign refiner program of this subpart must designate each batch of diesel fuel produced at the foreign refinery that is exported to the United States as either Certified DFR-Diesel or as Non-Certified DFR-Diesel, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. It must further designate all Certified DFR-Diesel as provided in § 80.598, and designate whether the diesel fuel is dyed or undyed, and for heating oil and/or locomotive or marine diesel fuel whether it is marked or unmarked under § 80.510(d) through (f).

                <P>(2) A <E T="03">foreign refiner</E> is a person who meets the definition of refiner under § 80.2(i) for a foreign refinery.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Toxics-FRGAS</E> means gasoline produced at a foreign refinery that has been assigned an individual refinery toxics baseline under § 80.915 and that is imported into the U.S.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Non-Toxics-FRGAS</E> means gasoline that is produced at a foreign refinery that has not been assigned an individual refinery toxics baseline, gasoline produced at a foreign refinery with an individual refinery toxics baseline that is not imported into the United States, and gasoline produced at a foreign refinery with an individual toxics baseline during a year when the foreign refiner has opted to not participate in the Toxics-FRGAS program under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Certified Toxics-FRGAS</E> means Toxics-FRGAS the foreign refiner intends to include in the foreign refinery's toxics compliance calculations under § 80.825, and does include in these compliance calculations when reported to EPA.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS</E> means Toxics-FRGAS that is not Certified Toxics-FRGAS.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Baseline establishment.</E> Any foreign refiner may submit a petition to the Administrator for an individual refinery toxics baseline pursuant to § 80.915 for all gasoline that was produced at the foreign refinery and imported into the United States between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000.</P>
                <P>(1) The refiner shall follow the procedures specified in §§ 80.91 through 80.93 to establish an anti-dumping baseline, if it does not already have such a baseline.</P>
                <P>(2) In making determinations for foreign refinery baselines, EPA will consider all information supplied by a foreign refiner, and in addition may rely on any and all appropriate assumptions necessary to make such determinations.</P>
                <P>(3)(i) Where a foreign refiner submits a petition that is incomplete or inadequate to establish an accurate toxics baseline, and the refiner fails to cure this defect after a request for more information, EPA will not assign an individual refinery toxics baseline.</P>
                <P>(ii) If a foreign refiner does not already have an anti-dumping individual baseline per § 80.94, and if pursuant to § 80.94(b)(5) EPA does not assign an individual anti-dumping baseline, EPA will also not assign an individual refinery toxics baseline.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">General requirements for foreign refiners with individual refinery toxics baselines.</E> A foreign refiner of a refinery that has been assigned an individual toxics baseline according to § 80.915 shall designate all gasoline produced at the foreign refinery that is exported to the United States as either Certified Toxics-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For calendar year 2006, the definitions of section 80.2 and the following additional definitions apply to this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Renewable fuel.</E> (i) <E T="03">Renewable fuel</E> means motor vehicle fuel that is used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a fuel mixture used to operate a motor vehicle, and which:</P>
              <P>(A) Is produced from grain, starch, oil seeds, vegetable, animal, or fish materials including fats, greases, and oils, sugarcane, sugar beets, sugar components, tobacco, potatoes, or other biomass; or</P>
              <P>(B) Is natural gas produced from a biogas source, including a landfill, sewage waste treatment plant, feedlot, or other place where decaying organic material is found.</P>
              <P>(ii) The term “renewable fuel” includes cellulosic biomass ethanol, waste derived ethanol, biodiesel, and any blending components derived from renewable fuel.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Cellulosic biomass ethanol</E> means ethanol derived from any lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter that is available on a renewable or recurring basis, including dedicated energy crops and trees, wood and wood residues, plants, grasses, agricultural residues, fibers, animal wastes and other waste materials, and municipal solid waste. The term also includes any ethanol produced in facilities where animal wastes or other waste materials are digested or otherwise used to displace 90 percent or more of the fossil fuel normally used in the production of ethanol.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Waste derived ethanol</E> means ethanol derived from animal wastes, including poultry fats and poultry wastes, and other waste materials, or municipal solid waste.<PRTPAGE P="436"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Small refinery</E> means a refinery for which the average aggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year (as determined by dividing the aggregate throughput for the calendar year by the number of days in the calendar year) does not exceed 75,000 barrels.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Biodiesel</E> means a diesel fuel substitute produced from nonpetroleum renewable resources that meets the registration requirements for fuels and fuel additives established by the Environmental Protection Agency under section 211 of the Clean Air Act. It includes biodiesel derived from animal wastes (including poultry fats and poultry wastes) and other waste materials, or biodiesel derived from municipal solid waste and sludges and oils derived from wastewater and the treatment of wastewater.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Renewable Fuel Standard for 2006.</E> The percentage of renewable fuel in the total volume of gasoline sold or dispensed to consumers in 2006 in the United States shall be a minimum of 2.78 percent on an annual average volume basis.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Responsible parties.</E> Parties collectively responsible for attainment of the standard in paragraph (b) of this section are refiners (including blenders) and importers of gasoline. However, a party that is a refiner only because he owns or operates a small refinery is exempt from this responsibility.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">EPA determination of attainment.</E> EPA will determine after the close of 2006 whether or not the requirement in paragraph (b) of this section has been met. EPA will base this determination on information routinely published by the Energy Information Administration on the annual domestic volume of gasoline sold or dispensed to U.S. consumers and of ethanol produced for use in such gasoline, supplemented by readily available information concerning the use in motor fuel of other renewable fuels such as cellulosic biomass ethanol, waste derived ethanol, biodiesel, and other non-ethanol renewable fuels.</P>
              <P>(1) The renewable fuel volume will equal the sum of all renewable fuel volumes used in motor fuel, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) One gallon of cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste derived ethanol shall be considered to be the equivalent of 2.5 gallons of renewable fuel; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Only the renewable fuel portion of blending components derived from renewable fuel shall be counted towards the renewable fuel volume.</P>
              <P>(2) If the nationwide average volume percent of renewable fuel in gasoline in 2006 is equal to or greater than the standard in paragraph (b) of this section, the standard has been met.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consequence of nonattainment in 2006.</E> In the event that EPA determines that the requirement in paragraph (b) of this section has not been attained in 2006, a deficit carryover volume shall be added to the renewable fuel volume obligation for 2007 for use in calculating the standard applicable to gasoline in 2007.</P>

              <P>(1) The deficit carryover volume shall be calculated as follows:
              </P>
              <FP>DC = Vgas * (Rs−Ra)</FP>

              <P>(1) Is a duplicate of a valid RIN.</P>
              <P>(2) Was based on volumes that have not been standardized to 60 °F.</P>
              <P>(3) Has expired.</P>
              <P>(4) Was based on an incorrect equivalence value.</P>
              <P>(5) Is deemed invalid under § 80.1167(g).</P>
              <P>(6) Does not represent renewable fuel as it is defined in § 80.1101.</P>
              <P>(7) Was otherwise improperly generated.</P>
              <P>(8) In the event that the same RIN is transferred to two or more parties, all such RINs will be deemed to be invalid, unless EPA in its sole discretion determines that some portion of these RINs is valid.</P>
              <P>(b) In the case of RINs that are invalid, the following provisions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Invalid RINs cannot be used to achieve compliance with the Renewable Volume Obligation of an obligated party or exporter, regardless of the party's good faith belief that the RINs were valid at the time they were acquired.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon determination by any party that RINs owned are invalid, the party must adjust their records, reports, and compliance calculations as necessary to reflect the deletion of the invalid RINs.</P>
              <P>(3) Any valid RINs remaining after deleting invalid RINs must first be applied to correct the transfer of invalid RINs to another party before applying the valid RINs to meet the party's Renewable Volume Obligation at the end of the compliance year.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) An <E T="03">obligated party</E> is any refiner that produces gasoline or diesel fuel within the 48 contiguous states or Hawaii, or any importer that imports gasoline or diesel fuel into the 48 contiguous states or Hawaii during a compliance period. A party that simply blends renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel fuel, as defined in § 80.1407(c) or (e), is not an obligated party.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrator approves a petition of Alaska or a United States territory to opt-in to the renewable fuel program under the provisions in § 80.1443, then “obligated party” shall also include any refiner that produces gasoline or diesel fuel within that state or territory, or any importer that imports gasoline or diesel fuel into that state or territory.</P>
              <P>(b) For each compliance period starting with 2010, an obligated party is required to demonstrate, pursuant to § 80.1427, that it has satisfied the Renewable Volume Obligations for that compliance period, as specified in § 80.1407(a).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Aggregation of facilities</E>—(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2), (d) and (e) of this section, an obligated party may comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section in the aggregate for all of the refineries that it operates, or for each refinery individually.</P>
              <P>(2) An obligated party that carries a deficit into year i + 1 must use the same approach to aggregation of facilities in year i + 1 as it did in year i.</P>
              <P>(d) An obligated party must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for all of its imported gasoline or diesel fuel in the aggregate.</P>
              <P>(e) An obligated party that is both a refiner and importer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for its imported gasoline or diesel fuel separately from gasoline or diesel fuel produced by its domestic refinery or refineries.</P>
              <P>(f) Where a refinery or import facility is jointly owned by two or more parties, the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section may be met by one of the joint owners for all of the gasoline or diesel fuel produced/imported at the facility, or each party may meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for the portion of the gasoline or diesel fuel that it produces or imports, as long as all of the gasoline or diesel fuel produced/imported at the facility is accounted for in determining the Renewable Volume Obligations under § 80.1407. In either case, all joint owners are subject to the liability provisions of § 80.1461(d).</P>
              <P>(g) The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section apply to the following compliance periods: Beginning in 2010, and every year thereafter, the compliance period is January 1 through December 31.</P>

              <P>(2) Multiple gallon-RINs generated to represent a given volume of renewable fuel can be represented by a single batch-RIN through the appropriate designation of the RIN volume codes SSSSSSSS and EEEEEEEE.</P>
              <P>(i) The value of SSSSSSSS in the batch-RIN shall be 00000001 to represent the first gallon-RIN associated with the volume of renewable fuel.</P>

              <P>(ii) The value of EEEEEEEE in the batch-RIN shall represent the last gallon-RIN associated with the volume of renewable fuel, based on the RIN volume V<E T="52">RIN</E> determined pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Under § 80.1452, RIN volumes will be managed by EMTS. RIN codes SSSSSSSS and EEEEEEEE do not have a role in EMTS.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Assignment of RINs to batches</E>—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section for delayed RINs, the producer or importer of renewable fuel must assign all RINs generated to volumes of renewable fuel.</P>

              <P>(3) Any party that exports a volume of renewable fuel must separate any RINs that have been assigned to the exported volume. A party may separate up to 2.5 RINs per gallon of exported renewable fuel.</P>
              <P>(4) Any party that produces, imports, owns, sells, or uses a volume of neat renewable fuel, or a blend of renewable fuel and diesel fuel, must separate any RINs that have been assigned to that volume of neat renewable fuel or that blend if:</P>
              <P>(i) The party designates the neat renewable fuel or blend as transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The neat renewable fuel or blend is used without further blending, in the designated form, as transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel.</P>
              <P>(5) Any party that produces, imports, owns, sells, or uses a volume of electricity or biogas for which RINs have been generated in accordance with § 80.1426(f) must separate any RINs that have been assigned to that volume of renewable electricity or biogas if:</P>
              <P>(i) The party designates the electricity or biogas as transportation fuel; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The electricity or biogas is used as transportation fuel.</P>
              <P>(6) RINs assigned to a volume of biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) can only be separated from that volume pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section if such biodiesel is blended into diesel fuel at a concentration of 80 volume percent biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) or less.</P>
              <P>(i) This paragraph (b)(6) shall not apply to biodiesel owned by obligated parties or to exported volumes of biodiesel.</P>

              <P>(10) Any party that produces a volume of renewable fuel may separate any RINs that have been generated to represent that volume of renewable fuel or that blend if that party retires the separated RINs to replace invalid RINs according to § 80.1474.</P>
              <P>(c) The party responsible for separating a RIN from a volume of renewable fuel shall change the K code in the RIN from a value of 1 to a value of 2 prior to transferring the RIN to any other party.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon and after separation of a RIN from its associated volume of renewable fuel, the separated RIN must be accompanied by a PTD pursuant to § 80.1453 when transferred to another party.</P>

              <P>(a) Renewable fuel blenders who handle and blend less than 250,000 gallons of renewable fuel per year, and who do not have one or more reported or unreported Renewable Volume Obligations, are permitted to delegate their RIN-related responsibilities to the party directly upstream of them who supplied the renewable fuel for blending.</P>
              <P>(b) The RIN-related responsibilities that may be delegated directly upstream include all of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The RIN separation requirements of § 80.1429.</P>
              <P>(2) The reporting requirements of § 80.1451.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Small refinery exemption.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) Transportation fuel produced at a refinery by a refiner, or foreign refiner (as defined at § 80.1465(a)), is exempt from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 from the renewable fuel standards of § 80.1405, and the owner or operator of the refinery, or foreign refinery, is exempt from the requirements that apply to obligated parties under this subpart M for fuel produced at the refinery if the refinery meets the definition of a small refinery under § 80.1401 for calendar year 2006.</P>
              <P>(2) The exemption of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall apply unless a refiner chooses to waive this exemption (as described in paragraph (f) of this section), or the exemption is extended (as described in paragraph (e) of this section).</P>
              <P>(3) For the purposes of this section, the term “refiner” shall include foreign refiners.</P>
              <P>(4) This exemption shall only apply to refineries that process crude oil through refinery processing units.</P>
              <P>(5) The small refinery exemption is effective immediately, except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) Refiners who own refineries that qualified as small under 40 CFR 80.1141 do not need to resubmit a small refinery verification letter under this subpart M. This paragraph (a) does not supersede § 80.1141.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) A refiner owning a small refinery must submit a verification letter to EPA containing all of the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) The annual average aggregate daily crude oil throughput for the period January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 (as determined by dividing the aggregate throughput for the calendar year by the number 365).</P>
              <P>(ii) A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the letter is true to the best of his/her knowledge, and that the refinery was small as of December 31, 2006.</P>
              <P>(iii) Name, address, phone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address of a corporate contact person.</P>
              <P>(2) Verification letters must be submitted by July 1, 2010 to one of the addresses listed in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) For foreign refiners the small refinery exemption shall be effective upon approval, by EPA, of a small refinery application. The application must contain all of the elements required for small refinery verification letters (as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), must satisfy the provisions of § 80.1465(f) through (i) and (o), and must be submitted by July 1, 2010 to one of the addresses listed in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) Small refinery verification letters are not required for those refiners who have already submitted a complete verification letter under subpart K of this part 80. Verification letters submitted under subpart K prior to July 1, 2010 that satisfy the requirements of subpart K shall be deemed to satisfy <PRTPAGE P="547"/>the requirements for verification letters under this subpart M.</P>
              <P>(c) If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information regarding a refinery's crude throughput (pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) in its small refinery verification letter, the exemption will be void as of the effective date of these regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) If a refiner is complying on an aggregate basis for multiple refineries, any such refiner may exclude from the calculation of its Renewable Volume Obligations (under § 80.1407) transportation fuel from any refinery receiving the small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) The exemption period in paragraph (a) of this section shall be extended by the Administrator for a period of not less than two additional years if a study by the Secretary of Energy determines that compliance with the requirements of this subpart would impose a disproportionate economic hardship on a small refinery.</P>
              <P>(2) A refiner may petition the Administrator for an extension of its small refinery exemption, based on disproportionate economic hardship, at any time.</P>
              <P>(i) A petition for an extension of the small refinery exemption must specify the factors that demonstrate a disproportionate economic hardship and must provide a detailed discussion regarding the hardship the refinery would face in producing transportation fuel meeting the requirements of § 80.1405 and the date the refiner anticipates that compliance with the requirements can reasonably be achieved at the small refinery.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator shall act on such a petition not later than 90 days after the date of receipt of the petition.</P>
              <P>(iii) In order to qualify for an extension of its small refinery exemption, a refinery must meet the definition of “small refinery” in § 80.1401 for the most recent full calendar year prior to seeking an extension and must be projected to meet the definition of “small refinery” in § 80.1401 for the year or years for which an exemption is sought. Failure to meet the definition of small refinery for any calendar year for which an exemption was granted would invalidate the exemption for that calendar year.</P>
              <P>(f) At any time, a refiner with a small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section may waive that exemption upon notification to EPA.</P>
              <P>(1) A refiner's notice to EPA that it intends to waive its small refinery exemption must be received by November 1 to be effective in the next compliance year.</P>
              <P>(2) The waiver will be effective beginning on January 1 of the following calendar year, at which point the transportation fuel produced at that refinery will be subject to the renewable fuels standard of § 80.1405 and the owner or operator of the refinery shall be subject to all other requirements that apply to obligated parties under this Subpart M.</P>
              <P>(3) The waiver notice must be sent to EPA at one of the addresses listed in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) A refiner that acquires a refinery from either an approved small refiner (as defined under § 80.1442(a)) or another refiner with an approved small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section shall notify EPA in writing no later than 20 days following the acquisition.</P>
              <P>(h) Verification letters under paragraph (b) of this section, petitions for small refinery hardship extensions under paragraph (e) of this section, and small refinery exemption waiver notices under paragraph (f) of this section shall be sent to one of the following addresses:</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A Risk Mitigation Plan (Plan) that demonstrates the growth of <E T="03">Arundo donax</E> or <E T="03">Pennisetum purpureum</E> will not pose a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel. The Plan must identify and incorporate best management practices (BMPs) into the production, management, transport, collection, monitoring, and processing of the feedstock. To the extent practicable, the Risk Mitigation Plan should utilize a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach to examine each phase of the pathway to identify spread reduction steps. BMPs should include the development of mitigation strategies and plans to minimize escape and other impacts (e.g., minimize soil disturbance), incorporate desirable traits (e.g., sterility or reduced seed production), develop and implement dispersal mitigation protocols prior to cultivation, develop multiple year eradication controls. Eradication controls should follow an approach of early detection and rapid response (EDRR) to unintended spread. EDRR efforts should demonstrate the likelihood that invasions will be halted while still localized and identify and employ cooperative networks, communication forums, and consultation processes with federal, state, and local agencies. The Risk Mitigation Plan must provide for the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Monitoring and reporting data for a period prior to planting that is sufficient to establish a baseline, through crop production, and extending beyond crop production for a sufficient period after the field is no longer used for feedstock production to ensure no remnants of giant reed or napier grass survive or spread.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Monitoring must include the area encompassing the feedstock growing areas, the transportation corridor between the growing areas and the renewable fuel production facility, and the renewable fuel production facility, extending to the distance of potential propagation of the feedstock species, or further if necessary.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Monitoring must reflect the likelihood of spread specific to the feedstock.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) A closure plan providing for the destruction and removal of feedstock from the growing area upon abandonment by the feedstock grower or end of production.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) A plan providing for an independent third party who will audit the monitoring and reporting conducted in accordance with the Plan on an annual basis, subject to approval of a different frequency by EPA.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A letter from the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to the renewable fuel producer stating USDA's conclusions and the bases therefore regarding whether the <E T="03">Arundo donax</E> or <E T="03">Pennisetum purpureum</E> does or does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel as proposed by the producer. This letter shall also include USDA's recommendation of whether it is appropriate to require the use of a financial mechanism to ensure the availability of financial resources sufficient to cover reasonable potential remediation costs associated with the invasive spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas. In coordination with USDA, EPA shall identify for the producer the appropriate USDA office from which the letter should originate.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Identification of all federal, state, regional, and local requirements related to invasive species that are applicable for the feedstock at the growing site and at all points between the growing site and the fuel production site.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) A copy of the agreement between the feedstock grower and fuel producer establishing all rights and duties of the parties related to the Risk Mitigation <PRTPAGE P="555"/>Plan and any other activities and liability associated with the prevention of the spread of <E T="03">Arundo donax</E> and/or <E T="03">Pennisetum purpureum</E> outside of the intended planting area.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) A copy of the agreement between the fuel producer and an independent third party describing how the third party will audit the monitoring and reporting conducted in accordance with the Risk Mitigation Plan on an annual basis, subject to approval of a different timeframe by EPA.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Information on the financial resources or other financial mechanism (such as a state-administered fund, bond, or certificate of deposit) that would be available to finance reasonable remediation activities associated with the potential spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas, and information on whether it is necessary to have any further such resources or mechanism. EPA may require a demonstration that there is an adequate financial mechanism (such as a state-administered fund, bond, or certificate of deposit) to ensure the availability of financial resources sufficient to cover reasonable potential remediation costs associated with the spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas.</P>
              <P>(9) EPA may require additional information as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(B) For a producer of renewable fuel made from <E T="03">Arundo donax</E> or <E T="03">Pennisetum purpureum</E> per § 80.1426(f)(14)(ii):</P>

Evidence must include data collected from similar environments (soils, temperatures, precipitation, USDA Hardiness Zones) as the proposed feedstock production project site and accepted by the scientific community. Such a demonstration should include consideration of the elements of a Risk Mitigation Plan set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(x)(A) of this section, fully disclose the potential invasiveness of the feedstock, provide a closure plan for the destruction and removal of feedstock from the growing area upon abandonment by the feedstock grower or end of production, and explain why a Risk Mitigation Plan is not needed to make the required determination.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A letter from the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to the renewable fuel producer stating USDA's conclusions and the bases therefore regarding whether the <E T="03">Arundo donax</E> or <E T="03">Pennisetum purpureum</E> does or does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel as proposed by the producer or importer. In coordination with USDA, EPA shall identify for the producer the appropriate USDA office from which the letter should originate.</P>

              <P>(C) EPA may suspend a producer's registration for purposes of generating RINs for renewable fuel using <E T="03">Arundo donax</E> or <E T="03">Pennisetum purpureum</E> as a feedstock if such feedstock has spread beyond the intended planting area.</P>

              <P>(iii) Whether economic considerations, legal constraints, historical land use and agricultural practices and other factors show that it is likely that producers of planted crops and crop residue will continue to use agricultural land within the 2007 baseline area of land identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section into the future, as opposed to clearing and cultivating land not included in the 2007 baseline area of land.</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether there is a reliable method to evaluate on an annual basis whether the 2007 baseline area of land identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is being or has been exceeded.</P>
              <P>(v) Whether a credible and reliable entity has been identified to conduct data gathering and analysis, including annual identification of the aggregate amount of cropland, pastureland, and land that is equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land, needed for the annual EPA evaluation specified in § 80.1454(g)(1), and whether the data, analyses, and methodologies are publicly available.</P>

              <P>(4)(i) Beginning January 1, 2017, any refiner who produces gasoline using computer-controlled in-line blending equipment is exempt from the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section to obtain the test results required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section prior to the gasoline leaving the refinery, provided that the refiner obtains an exemption from this requirement from EPA. To obtain such exemption, the refiner must—</P>
              <P>(A) Have been granted an in-line blending exemption under § 80.65(f)(4); or</P>
              <P>(B) If the refiner has not been granted an exemption under § 80.65(f)(4), submit to EPA all of the information required under § 80.65(f)(4)(i)(A). A letter signed by the president, chief operating officer or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B).</P>
              <P>(ii) Refiners who seek an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section must comply with any EPA request for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption.</P>
              <P>(iii) Within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a submission under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section, EPA will notify the refiner if the exemption is not approved or of any deficiencies in the refiner's submission, or if any additional information is required or other requirements are included in the exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. In the absence of such notification from EPA, the effective date of an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for refiners who do not hold an exemption under § 80.65(f)(4) is 60 days from EPA's receipt of the refiner's submission under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iv) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the refiner's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the sulfur content of the refinery's gasoline production, or if EPA determines that any other circumstances exist which merit modification of the requirements of an exemption, such as advancements in the state of the art for in-line blending measurement which allow for additional control or more accurate monitoring or documentation of sulfur content. If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the refiner's exemption will be void <E T="03">ab initio.</E>

              <SUBJECT>Standards and requirements that apply to refiners producing gasoline by blending blendstocks into previously certified gasoline (PCG).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any refiner who produces gasoline by blending blendstock into PCG, as defined at § 80.2(d), must meet the requirements of § 80.1630 to sample and test every batch of gasoline as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Exclude the PCG for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the sulfur standards of this subpart O.<PRTPAGE P="643"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) To accomplish the exclusion required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the refiner must determine the volume and sulfur content of the PCG used at the refinery and the volume and sulfur content of the gasoline produced at the refinery, and use the compliance calculation procedures in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) For each batch of PCG that is used to produce gasoline the refiner must include the volume and sulfur content of the PCG as a negative volume and a positive sulfur content in the refiner's compliance calculations in accord with the requirements at § 80.1603.</P>
              <P>(4) For each batch of gasoline produced at the refinery using PCG and blendstock, the refiner must determine the volume and sulfur content of the combined product and include each batch of combined product for purposes of sulfur compliance in the refinery's compliance calculations at § 80.1603 without regard to the presence of previously certified gasoline in the batch.</P>
              <P>(5) The refiner must use any PCG that it includes as a negative batch in its compliance calculations pursuant to § 80.1603 as a component in gasoline production during the annual averaging period in which the PCG was included as a negative batch in the refiner's compliance calculations.</P>
              <P>(6) The refiner must also comply with § 80.65(i) when producing RBOB or RFG and § 80.101(g)(9) when producing conventional gasoline or CBOB.</P>
              <P>(7) Any negative annual average sulfur value shall be reported as zero and not as a negative result.</P>
              <P>(b) In the alternative, a refiner may sample and test each batch of blendstock when received at the refinery to determine the volume and sulfur content, and treat each blendstock receipt as a separate batch for purposes of compliance calculations for the annual average sulfur standard and for reporting. This alternative applies only if every batch of blendstock used at a refinery during an averaging period has a sulfur content that is equal to, or less than, the applicable per-gallon cap standard under § 80.1603.</P>
              <P>(c) Refiners who blend only butane into PCG may meet the sampling and testing requirements of this subpart O for sulfur by using sulfur test results of the butane supplier, provided that the requirements of § 80.82 are met.</P>
              <P>(d) Refiners who blend only blender grade pentane into PCG may meet the sampling and testing requirements of this subpart O for sulfur by using sulfur test results of the pentane supplier, provided that the requirements of § 80.85 are met.</P>

              <P>Importers who import gasoline into the United States by truck may comply with the following requirements instead of the requirements to sample and test every batch of gasoline under § 80.1630, and the annual sulfur average and per-gallon cap standards otherwise applicable to importers under § 80.1603:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Alternative standards.</E> The imported gasoline must comply with the following standards:</P>
              <P>(1) The annual average standard of 10 ppm and the per-gallon standard of 80 ppm as provided by § 80.1603; or</P>
              <P>(2) A per-gallon standard of 10 ppm.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Terminal testing.</E> The importer may use test results for sulfur content testing conducted by the terminal operator, for gasoline contained in the storage tank from which trucks used to transport gasoline into the United States are loaded, for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the standards in paragraph (a) of this section, provided all the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The sampling and testing shall be performed after each receipt of gasoline into the storage tank, or immediately before each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck.</P>
              <P>(2) The sampling and testing shall be performed using the methods specified in §§ 80.8 and 80.47, respectively.</P>

              <P>(3) At the time of each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck for import to the United States, the importer must obtain a copy of the terminal test result that indicates the sulfur content of the truck load (or each compartment if fuel was loaded from different storage tanks).<PRTPAGE P="644"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Quality assurance program.</E> The importer must conduct a quality assurance program for each truck loading terminal as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Quality assurance samples must be obtained from the truck-loading terminal and tested by the importer, or by an independent laboratory, and the terminal operator must not know in advance when samples are to be collected.</P>
              <P>(2) The sampling and testing must be performed using the methods specified in §§ 80.8 and 80.47, respectively.</P>

              <P>(3) The quality assurance test results for sulfur must differ from the terminal test result by no more than the ASTM reproducibility of the terminal's test results, as determined by the following equation:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">R = 105 × ((S + 2) / 104) 0.4</FP>

              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(4) The frequency of the quality assurance sampling and testing must be at least one sample for each fifty of an importer's trucks that are loaded at a terminal, or one sample per month, whichever is more frequent.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Party required to conduct quality assurance testing.</E> The quality assurance program under paragraph (c) of this section shall be conducted by the importer. In the alternative, this testing may be conducted by an independent laboratory that meets the criteria under § 80.65(f)(2)(iii), provided the importer receives, no later than 21 days after the sample was taken, copies of all results of tests conducted.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Assignment of batch numbers.</E> The importer must treat each truckload of imported gasoline as a separate batch for purposes of reporting under § 80.1652 and assigning batch numbers and maintaining records under § 80.1653.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">EPA inspections of terminals.</E> EPA inspectors or auditors, and auditors conducting attest engagements under § 80.1667, must be given full and immediate access to the truck-loading terminal and any laboratory at which samples of gasoline collected at the terminal are analyzed, and must be allowed to conduct inspections, review records, collect gasoline samples, and perform audits. These inspections or audits may be either announced or unannounced.</P>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reporting requirements.</E> Any importer who elects to comply with the alternative standards in paragraph (a) of this section shall comply with all the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) All importer recordkeeping and reporting requirements under §§ 80.1652 and 80.1653, except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An importer who elects to comply with the alternative standards in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must certify in the annual report whether it is in compliance with the applicable per-gallon batch standard set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in lieu of providing the information required by § 80.1652 regarding annual average sulfur content and compliance with the average standard under § 80.1603.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Effect of noncompliance.</E> If any of the requirements of this section are not met, all gasoline imported by the truck importer during the time any requirements are not met is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur average and per-gallon cap standards in § 80.1603. Additionally, if any requirement is not met, EPA may notify the importer of the violation and, if the requirement is not fulfilled within 10 days of notification, the truck importer may not in the future use the sampling and testing provisions in this section in lieu of the provisions in § 80.1630.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Sampling requirements.</E> Producers and importers of oxygenates for use by oxygenate blenders shall collect a representative sample from each batch of <PRTPAGE P="645"/>oxygenate produced or imported prior to the oxygenate leaving the oxygenate production or import facility, using the sampling methods specified in § 80.8 or § 80.47.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of oxygenate sulfur content.</E> Producers and importers of oxygenates must test each batch of oxygenate they produce or import to determine its sulfur content to the nearest ppm using a test method provided in § 80.47, or, with respect to DFE may use the alternative means of determining the sulfur content contained in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative means of determining the sulfur content of DFE.</E> As an alternative to testing each batch of DFE pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the sulfur content of batches of DFE produced using certified denaturant meeting the requirements of § 80.1611 may be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The sulfur content of the batch of DFE shall be calculated by volume weighting the sulfur contribution from the denaturant, and the neat ethanol used.</P>
              <P>(2) The sulfur content of the neat (un-denatured) ethanol used in the calculation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be assumed to be negligible or assumed to be some specific value for the purposes of calculating the sulfur content of the DFE batch provided that the DFE manufacturer or importer conducts production quality control which demonstrates that such an assumption is valid. Otherwise, the sulfur content of the neat ethanol must be determined in accordance with the test requirements of § 80.1630.</P>
              <P>(3) The sulfur content of the certified denaturant used in the calculation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be consistent with the PTD obtained from a registered certified ethanol denaturant producer or importer in accordance with the requirements of § 80.1611. If the PTD from the certified ethanol denaturant states that the sulfur content is 330 ppm, then the sulfur content of the sulfur content of the ethanol denaturant must be assumed to be 330 ppm.</P>
              <P>(4) A sample of each batch of DFE must be retained pursuant to the requirements of § 80.1643.</P>
              <P>(5) The sulfur content of each batch of DFE shall be reported to the nearest ppm.</P>

                <P>In order to obtain satisfactory accuracy with the small amounts of phosphorus involved, it is necessary to take extensive precautions in handling. The usual precautions of cleanliness, careful manipulation, and avoidance of contamination should be scrupulously observed; also, all glassware should be cleaned before use, with cleaning acid or by some procedure that does not involve use of commercial detergents. These compounds often contain alkali phosphates which are strongly adsorbed by glass surfaces and are not removed by ordinary rinsing. It is desirable to segregate a special stock of glassware for use only in the determination of phosphorus.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>8.2 Make a deep depression in the center of the zinc oxide pile with a stirring rod.</P>

              <P>8.3 Pipet the gasoline sample (Note 10) (see 7.2 for suggested sample volume) into the depression in the zinc oxide. Record the temperature of the fuel if the phosphorus content is required at 60 °F (15.6 °C) and make correction as directed in 9.2.

                <P>For the 10-ml sample use multiple additions and a syringe. Hold the tip of the needle at approximately <FR>2/3</FR> of the depth of the zinc oxide layer and slowly deliver 2 ml of the sample: fast sample delivery may give low results. Give sufficient time for the gasoline to be absorbed by the zinc oxide. Follow step 8.6. Cool the dish to room temperature. Repeat steps 8.3 and 8.6 until all the sample has been burned. Safety—cool the ignition dish before adding the additional aliquots of gasoline to avoid a flash fire.</P>

              <P>8.4 Cover the sample with a small amount of fresh zinc oxide from reagent bottle (use the tip of a small spatula to deliver approximately 0.2 g). Tap the sides of the ignition dish to pack the zinc oxide.</P>
              <P>8.5 Prepare the blank, using the same amount of zinc oxide in an ignition dish.</P>

              <P>8.6 Ignite the gasoline, using the flame from a bunsen burner. Allow the gasoline to burn to extinction (<E T="04">Note</E> 10).</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Scope.</HD>
              <P>1.1. This method covers the determination of the total lead content of gasoline. The procedure's calibration range is 0.010 to 0.10 gram of lead/U.S. gal. Samples above this level should be diluted to fall within this range or a higher level calibration standard curve must be prepared. The higher level curve must be shown to be linear and measurement of lead at these levels must be shown to be accurate by the analysis of control samples at a higher level of alkyl lead content. The method compensates for variations in gasoline composition and is independent of lead alkyl type.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Summary of method.</HD>
              <P>2.1 The gasoline sample is diluted with methyl isobutyl ketone and the alkyl lead compounds are stabilized by reaction with iodine and a quarternary ammonium salt. The lead content of the sample is determined by atomic absorption flame spectrometry at 2833 A, using standards prepared from reagent grade lead chloride. By the use of this treatment, all alkyl lead compounds give identical response.</P>

              <P>2.1 The gasoline sample is diluted with methly isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and the alkyl lead compounds are stabilized by reacting with iodine and a quarternary ammonium salt.

              <P>2.2 The dilution of the gasoline with MIBK compensates for severe non-atomic absorption, scatter from unburned carbon containing species and matrix effects caused in part by the burning characteristics of gasoline.</P>
              <P>2.3 The <E T="03">in-situ</E> reaction of alkyl lead in gasoline with iodine eliminates the problem of variations in response due to different alkyl types by leveling the response of all alkyl lead compounds.</P>

If a more limited range is desired as required for linearity, such range shall be covered by at least five standard solutions approximately equally spaced and this range shall not be exceeded by any of the samples. Place each of the standard solutions in a sample cell using techniques consistent with good operating practice for the spectrometer employed. Insert the sample in the spectrometer and allow the spectrometer atmosphere to reach equilibrium (if appropriate). Measure the intensity of the lead L alpha peak at 1.175 angstroms, the Compton scatter peak of the tungsten L alpha line at 1.500 angstroms and the background at 1.211 angstroms. Each measured intensity should exceed 200,000 counts or the time of measurement should be at least 30 seconds. The relative standard deviation of each measurement, based on counting statistics, should be one percent or less. The Compton scatter peak given above is for 90° instrument geometry and should be changed for other geometries. The Compton scatter peak (in angstroms) is found at the wavelength of the tungsten L alpha line plus 0.024 (1-cos phi), where phi is the angle between the incident radiation and the take-off collimator.</P>
