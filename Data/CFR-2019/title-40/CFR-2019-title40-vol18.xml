      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this part is to establish certain general provisions and the operating permit program requirements for affected sources and affected units under the Acid Rain Program, pursuant to title IV of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401, <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as amended by Public Law 101-549 (November 15, 1990).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The regulations under this part set forth certain generally applicable provisions under the Acid Rain Program. The regulations also set forth requirements for obtaining three types of Acid Rain permits, during Phases I and II, for which an affected source may apply: Acid Rain permits issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency during Phase I; the Acid Rain portion of an operating permit issued by a State permitting authority during Phase II; and the Acid Rain portion of an operating permit issued by EPA when it is the permitting authority during Phase II. The requirements under this part supplement, and in some cases modify, the requirements under parts 70 and 71 of this chapter and other regulations implementing title V for approving and implementing State operating permit programs and for Federal issuance of operating permits under title V, as such requirements apply to affected sources under the Acid Rain Program.</P>

For solid waste incinerators which began operation before January 1, 1985, the average annual fuel consumption of non-fossil fuels for calendar years 1985 through 1987 must be greater than 80 percent for such an incinerator to be exempt. For solid waste incinerators which began operation after January 1, 1985, the average annual fuel consumption of non-fossil fuels for the first three years of operation must be greater than 80 percent for such an incinerator to be exempt. If, during any three calendar year period after November 15, 1990, such incinerator consumes 20 percent or more (on a Btu basis) fossil fuel, such incinerator will be an affected source under the Acid Rain Program.</P>
              <P>(8) A non-utility unit.</P>
              <P>(9) A unit for which an exemption under § 72.7 or § 72.8 is in effect. Although such a unit is not an affected unit, the unit shall be subject to the requirements of § 72.7 or § 72.8, as applicable to the exemption.</P>
              <P>(c) A certifying official of an owner or operator of any unit may petition the Administrator for a determination of applicability under this section.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) Any new utility unit that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and that is allocated one or more allowances under subpart B of part 73 of this chapter shall be exempt from the Acid Rain Program, except for the provisions of this section, §§ 72.2 through 72.6, and §§ 72.10 through 72.13, if each of the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The designated representative (authorized in accordance with subpart B of this part) or, if no designated representative has been authorized, a certifying official of each owner of the unit submits to the permitting authority otherwise responsible for administering a Phase II Acid Rain permit for the unit a statement (in a format prescribed by the Administrator) that:</P>
              <P>(A) Identifies the unit and states the nameplate capacity of each generator served by the unit and the fuels currently burned or expected to be burned by the unit and their sulfur content by weight;</P>
              <P>(B) States that the owners and operators of the unit will comply with paragraph (f) of this section;</P>
              <P>(C) Surrenders allowances equal in number to, and with the same or earlier compliance use date as, all of those allocated to the unit under subpart B of part 73 of this chapter for the first year that the unit is to be exempt under this section and for each subsequent year; and</P>

              <P>(D) Surrenders any proceeds for allowances under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) or this section withheld from the unit <PRTPAGE P="32"/>under § 73.10 of this chapter. If the Administrator is not the permitting authority, a copy of the statement shall be submitted to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator deducts from the compliance account of the source that includes the unit allowances under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section and receives proceeds under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section. Within 5 business days of receiving a statement in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the Administrator shall either deduct the allowances under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section or notify the owners and operators that there are insufficient allowances to make such deductions.</P>
              <P>(2) The exemption under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be effective on January 1 of the first full calendar year for which the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c)(1) of this section are met. After notification by the Administrator under the third sentence of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the permitting authority shall amend under § 72.83 the operating permit covering the source at which the unit is located, if the source has such a permit, to add the provisions and requirements of the exemption under paragraphs (a), (c)(1), (d), and (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Compliance with the requirement that fuel burned during the year have an annual average sulfur content of 0.05 percent by weight or less shall be determined as follows using a method of determining sulfur content that provides information with reasonable precision, reliability, accessibility, and timeliness:</P>
              <P>(1) For gaseous fuel burned during the year, if natural gas is the only gaseous fuel burned, the requirement is assumed to be met;</P>
              <P>(2) For gaseous fuel burned during the year where other gas in addition to or besides natural gas is burned, the requirement is met if the annual average sulfur content is equal to or less than 0.05 percent by weight.

              <P>(3)(i) The Administrator will approve in whole, in part, or with changes or conditions, or deny the petition under paragraph (f)(1) of this section within 90 days of receipt of the petition. The Administrator will treat the petition, as changed or conditioned upon approval, as amending any identification <PRTPAGE P="47"/>of dispatch system that is submitted prior to the approval and includes any portion of the unit for which the petition is approved. Where any portion of a unit is not covered by an approved petition, that remaining portion of the unit shall continue to be part of the unit's dispatch system.</P>
              <P>(ii) In approving the petition, the Administrator will determine, on a case-by-case basis, the proper calculation and treatment, for purposes of the reports required under §§ 72.91 and 72.92, of plan reductions and compensating generation provided to other units.</P>
              <P>(4) The designated representative for the unit for which a petition is approved under paragraph (f)(3) of this section and the designated representatives of all other units included in all dispatch systems that include any portion of the unit shall submit all annual compliance certification reports, dispatch system data reports, and other reports required under §§ 72.91 and 72.92 treating, as a separate Phase I unit, each portion of the unit for which a petition is approved under paragraph (f)(3) of this section and the remaining portion of the unit. The reports shall include all required calculations and demonstrations, treating each such portion of the unit as a separate Phase I unit. Upon request, the designated representatives shall demonstrate that the data in all the reports under §§ 72.91 and 72.92 has been properly attributed or apportioned among the portions of the unit and the dispatch systems and that there is no undercounting or double-counting with regard to such data.</P>
              <P>(i) The baseline of each portion of the unit for which a petition is approved shall be determined under paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. The baseline of the remaining portion of such unit shall equal the baseline of the unit less the sum of the baselines of any portions of the unit for which a petition is approved.</P>
              <P>(ii) The actual utilization of each portion of the unit for which a petition is approved shall be determined under paragraphs (f)(l) (i) and (ii) of this section. The actual utilization of the remaining portion of such unit shall equal the actual utilization of the unit less the sum of the actual utilizations of any portions of the unit for which a petition is approved. Upon request, the designated representative of the unit shall demonstrate in the annual compliance certification report that the requirements concerning calculation of actual utilization under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) and any requirements established under paragraph (f)(3) of this section are met.</P>

              <P>(i) All portions of the unit be treated as part of the dispatch system of the unit in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this paragraph and any identification of dispatch system submitted under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) The designated representatives make all submissions under §§ 72.91 and 72.92 (including the dispatch system data report), treating the entire unit as a single Phase I unit, in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this paragraph and any identification of dispatch system submitted under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The designated representative surrender for deduction the number of allowances calculated, consistent with the reports under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section and §§ 72.91 and 72.92, using the formula in § 72.92(c) and treating the entire unit as a single Phase I unit.</P>

              <P>(6) The designated representative may submit a notification to terminate an approved petition by January 30 of the first year for which the termination is to take effect. The notification must be signed and certified by the designated representatives of all units included in all dispatch systems <PRTPAGE P="48"/>that include any portion of the unit apportioned under the petition. Upon receipt of the notification meeting the requirements of the prior two sentences by the Administrator, the approved petition is no longer in effect for that year and the remaining years in Phase I and the designated representatives shall make all submissions under §§ 72.91 and 72.92 treating the petition as no longer in effect for all such years.</P>
              <P>(7) Except as expressly provided in paragraphs (f)(1) through (6) of this section or the Administrator's approval of the petition, all provisions of the Acid Rain Program applicable to an affected source or an affected unit shall apply to the entire unit regardless of whether a petition has been submitted or approved, or reports have been submitted, under such paragraphs. Approval of a petition under such paragraphs shall not constitute a determination of the percentage ownership in a unit under any other provision of the Acid Rain Program and shall not change the liability of the owners and operators of an affected unit that has excess emissions under § 72.9(e).</P>

              <P>(a) For each affected unit included in an Acid Rain permit application, a complete compliance plan shall:</P>
              <P>(1) For sulfur dioxide emissions, certify that, as of the allowance transfer deadline, the designated representative will hold allowances in the compliance account of the source where the unit is located (after deductions under § 73.34(c) of this chapter) not less than the total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide from the affected units at the source. The compliance plan may also specify, in accordance with this subpart, one or more of the Acid Rain compliance options.</P>
              <P>(2) For nitrogen oxides emissions, certify that the unit will comply with the applicable emission limitation under § 76.5, § 76.6, or § 76.7 of this chapter or shall specify one or more Acid Rain compliance options, in accordance with part 76 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Multi-unit compliance options.</E> (1) A plan for a compliance option, under § 72.41, § 72.42, § 72.43, or § 72.44 of this part, under § 74.47 of this chapter, or a NO<E T="52">X</E> averaging plan under § 76.11 of this chapter, that includes units at more than one affected source shall be complete only if:</P>
              <P>(i) Such plan is signed and certified by the designated representative for each source with an affected unit governed by such plan; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A complete permit application is submitted covering each unit governed by such plan.</P>
              <P>(2) A permitting authority's approval of a plan under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that includes units in more than one State shall be final only after every permitting authority with jurisdiction over any such unit has approved the plan with the same modifications or conditions, if any.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditional Approval.</E> In the compliance plan, the designated representative of an affected unit may propose, in accordance with this subpart, any Acid Rain compliance option for conditional approval, except a Phase I extension plan; <E T="03">provided</E> that an Acid Rain compliance option under section 407 of the Act may be conditionally proposed only to the extent provided in part 76 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(1) To activate a conditionally-approved Acid Rain compliance option, the designated representative shall notify the permitting authority in writing that the conditionally-approved compliance option will actually be pursued beginning January 1 of a specified year. If the conditionally approved compliance option includes a plan described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the designated representative of each source governed by the plan shall sign and certify the notification. Such notification shall be subject to the limitations on activation under subpart D of this part and part 76 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) The notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall specify the first calendar year and the last calendar year for which the conditionally approved Acid Rain compliance option <PRTPAGE P="49"/>is to be activated. A conditionally approved compliance option shall be activated, if at all, before the date of any enforceable milestone applicable to the compliance option. The date of activation of the compliance option shall not be a defense against failure to meet the requirements applicable to that compliance option during each calendar year for which the compliance option is activated.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon submission of a notification meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the conditionally-approved Acid Rain compliance option becomes binding on the owners and operators and the designated representative of any unit governed by the conditionally-approved compliance option.</P>
              <P>(4) A notification meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section will revise the unit's permit in accordance with § 72.83 (administrative permit amendment).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination of compliance option.</E> (1) The designated representative for a unit may terminate an Acid Rain compliance option by notifying the permitting authority in writing that an approved compliance option will be terminated beginning January 1 of a specified year. If the compliance option includes a plan described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the designated representative for each source governed by the plan shall sign and certify the notification. Such notification shall be subject to the limitations on termination under subpart D of this part and part 76 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The notification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall specify the calendar year for which the termination will take effect.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon submission of a notification meeting the requirements of paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section, the termination becomes binding on the owners and operators and the designated representative of any unit governed by the Acid Rain compliance option to be terminated.</P>
              <P>(4) A notification meeting the requirements of paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section will revise the unit's permit in accordance with § 72.83 (administrative permit amendment).</P>

              <P>(1) Any unit listed in table 1 of § 73.10(a) of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any other existing utility unit that is an affected unit under this part, provided that this section shall not apply to a unit under section 410 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The designated representative may include, in the Acid Rain permit application for a unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a substitution plan under which one or more units under paragraph (a)(2) of this section are designated as substitution units, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) Each unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is under the control of the owner or operator of each unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section that designates the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as a substitution unit; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the emissions reductions achieved under the plan shall be the same or greater than would have been achieved by all units governed by the plan without such plan.</P>
              <P>(2) The designated representative of each source with a unit designated as a substitution unit in any plan submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall incorporate in the permit application each such plan.</P>
              <P>(3) The designated representative may submit a substitution plan not later than 6 months (or 90 days if submitted in accordance with § 72.82), or a notification to activate a conditionally approved plan in accordance with § 72.40(c) not later than 60 days, before the allowance transfer deadline applicable to the first year for which the plan is to take effect.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents of a substitution plan.</E> A complete substitution plan shall include the following elements in a format prescribed by the Administrator:<PRTPAGE P="50"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Identification of each unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and each substitution unit to be governed by the substitution plan. A unit shall not be a substitution unit in more than one substitution plan.</P>
              <P>(2) Except where the designated representative requests conditional approval of the plan, the first calendar year and, if known, the last calendar year in which the substitution plan is to be in effect. Unless the designated representative specifies an earlier calendar year, the last calendar year will be deemed to be 1999.</P>
              <P>(3) Demonstration that the total emissions reductions achieved under the substitution plan will be equal to or greater than the total emissions reductions that would have been achieved without the plan, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For each substitution unit:</P>
              <P>(A) The unit's baseline.</P>
              <P>(B) Each of the following: the unit's 1985 actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; the unit's 1985 allowable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; the unit's 1989 actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; the unit's 1990 actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; and, as of November 15, 1990, the most stringent unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation covering the unit for 1995-1999. For purposes of determining the most stringent emissions limitation, applicable emissions limitations shall be converted to lbs/mmBtu in accordance with appendix B of this part. Where the most stringent emissions limitation is not the same for every year in 1995-1999, the most stringent emissions limitation shall be stated separately for each year.</P>
              <P>(C) The lesser of: the unit's 1985 actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; the unit's 1985 allowable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; or, as of November 15, 1990, the most stringent unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation covering the unit for 1995-99. Where the most stringent emissions limitation is not the same for every year during 1995-1999, the lesser of the emissions rates shall be determined separately for each year using the most stringent emissions limitation for that year.</P>
              <P>(D) The product of the baseline in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section and the emissions rate in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section, divided by 2000 lbs/ton. Where the most stringent emissions limitation is not the same for every year during 1995-1999, the product in the prior sentence shall be calculated separately for each year using the emissions rate determined for that year in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) The sum of the amounts in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section for all substitution units to be governed by the plan. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, this sum is the total number of allowances available each year under the substitution plan.</P>

              <P>(B) Where the most stringent unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation is not the same for every year during 1995-1999, the sum in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section shall be calculated separately for each year using the amounts calculated for that year in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Each separate sum is the total number of allowances available for the respective year under the substitution plan.</P>

              <P>(iii) Where, as of November 15, 1990, a non-unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation covers the unit for any year during 1995-1999, the designated representative shall state each such limitation and propose a method for applying the unit-specific and non-unit-specific emissions limitations under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Distribution of substitution allowances. (i) A statement that the allowances in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section are not to be distributed to any units under paragraph (a)(1) of this section that are to be governed by the plan; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A list showing any annual distribution of the allowances in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section from a substitution unit to a unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section that, under the plan, designates the substitution unit.</P>

              <P>(5) A demonstration that the substitution plan meets the requirement that each unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is under the control of the owner or operator of each unit under <PRTPAGE P="51"/>paragraph (a)(1) of this section that designates the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as a substitution unit. The demonstration shall be one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage ownership interest of 50 percent or more in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the units have a common operator, a statement identifying such owners or operators and their aggregate percentage ownership interest in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or identifying the units' common operator. The designated representative shall submit supporting documentation upon request by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage ownership interest of at least 10 percent and less than 50 percent in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the units do not have a common operator, a statement identifying such owners or operators and their aggregate percentage ownership interest in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and stating that each such owner or operator has the contractual right to direct the dispatch of the electricity that, because of its ownership interest, it has the right to receive from the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The fact that the electricity that such owner or operator has the right to receive is centrally dispatched through a power pool will not be the basis for determining that the owner or operator does not have the contractual right to direct the dispatch of such electricity. The designated representative shall submit supporting documentation upon request by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(iii) A copy of an agreement that is binding on the owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provides each of the following elements, and is supported by documentation meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section:</P>

              <P>(A) The owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must not allow the unit to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of a maximum annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate (in lbs/mmBtu), specified in the agreement, for each year during the period that the substitution plan is in effect.</P>
              <P>(B) The maximum annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate for the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed 70 percent of the lesser of: the unit's 1985 actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; the unit's 1985 allowable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate; the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation, as of November 15, 1990, applicable to the unit in Phase I; or the lesser of the average actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate or the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation for the unit for four consecutive quarters that immediately precede the 30-day period ending on the date the substitution plan is submitted to the Administrator. If the unit is covered by a non-unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation in the four consecutive quarters or, as of November 15, 1990, in Phase I, the Administrator will determine, on a case-by-case basis, how to apply the non-unit-specific emissions limitation for purposes of determining whether the maximum annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate meets the requirement of the prior sentence. If a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation is not different from a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation that was effective and applicable to the unit in 1985, the Administrator will apply the non-unit-specific SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation by using the 1985 allowable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate.</P>
              <P>(C) For each year that the actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section exceeds the maximum annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate, the designated representative of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must surrender allowances for deduction from the Allowance <PRTPAGE P="52"/>Tracking System account of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The designated representative shall surrender allowances authorizing emissions equal to the baseline of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section multiplied by the difference between the actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the maximum annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate and divided by 2000 lbs/ton. The surrender shall be made by the allowance transfer deadline of the year of the exceedance, and the surrendered allowances shall have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances allocated to the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for that year. The designated representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted. In the absence of such identification, allowances will be deducted on a first-in, first-out basis under § 73.35(c)(2) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(D) The unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall designate a common designated representative during the period that the substitution plan is in effect. Having a common alternate designated representative shall not satisfy the requirement in the prior sentence.</P>

              <P>(E) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, the actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate for any year and the average actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate for any period shall be determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(6) A demonstration under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section shall include the following supporting documentation:</P>
              <P>(i) The calculation of the average actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate and the most stringent federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation for the unit for the four consecutive quarters that immediately preceded the 30-day period ending on the date the substitution plan is submitted to the Administrator. To the extent that the four consecutive quarters include a quarter prior to January 1, 1995, the SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate for the quarter shall be determined applying the methodology for calculating SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions set forth in appendix C of this part. This methodology shall be applied using data submitted for the quarter to the Secretary of Energy on United States Department of Energy Form 767 or, if such data has not been submitted for the quarter, using the data prepared for such submission for the quarter.</P>

              <P>(ii) A description of the actions that will be taken in order for the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to comply with the maximum annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of any contract for implementing the actions described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section that was executed before the date on which the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section is executed. The designated representative shall state the execution date of each such contract and state whether the contract is expressly contingent on the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) A showing that the actions described under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section will not be implemented during Phase I unless the unit is approved as a substitution unit.</P>
              <P>(7) The special provisions in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Administrator's action.</E> (1) If the Administrator approves a substitution plan, he or she will allocate allowances to the Allowance Tracking System accounts of the units under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and substitution units, as provided in the approved plan, upon issuance of an Acid Rain permit containing the plan, except that if the substitution plan is conditionally approved, the allowances will be allocated upon revision of the permit to activate the plan.</P>
              <P>(2) In no event shall allowances be allocated to a substitution unit, under an approved substitution plan, for any year in excess of the sum calculated and applicable to that year under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, as adjusted by the Administrator in approving the plan.</P>

              <P>(3) Where, as of November 15, 1990, a non-unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limitation covers the unit for any year during 1995-1999, the Administrator <PRTPAGE P="53"/>will specify on a case-by-case basis a method for using unit-specific and non-unit-specific emissions limitations in allocating allowances to the substitution unit. The specified method will not treat a non-unit-specific emissions limitation as a unit-specific emissions limitation and will not result in substitution units retaining allowances allocated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for emissions reductions necessary to meet a non-unit- specific emissions limitation. Such method may require an end-of-year review and the adjustment of the allowances allocated to the substitution unit and may require the designated representative of the substitution unit to surrender allowances by the allowance transfer deadline of the year that is subject to the review. Any surrendered allowances shall have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances originally allocated for the year, and the designated representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted. In the absence of such identification, such allowances will be deducted on a first-in, first-out basis under § 73.35(c)(2) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Special provisions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Emissions Limitations.</E> (i) Each substitution unit governed by an approved substitution plan shall become a Phase I unit from January 1 of the year for which the plan takes effect until January 1 of the year for which the plan is no longer in effect or is terminated. The designated representative of a substitution unit shall surrender allowances, and the Administrator will deduct allowances, in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and each substitution unit, governed by an approved substitution plan shall be subject to the Acid Rain emissions limitations for nitrogen oxides in accordance with part 76 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Where an approved substitution plan includes a demonstration under paragraphs (c)(5)(iii) and (c)(6) of this section.</P>

              <P>(A) The owners and operators of the substitution unit covered by the demonstration shall implement the actions described under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, as adjusted by the Administrator in approving the plan or in revising the permit. The designated representative may submit proposed permit revisions changing the description of the actions to be taken in order for the substitution unit to achieve the maximum annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate under the approved plan and shall include in any such submission a showing that the actions in the changed description will not be implemented during Phase I unless the unit remains a substitution unit. The permit revision will be treated as an administrative amendment, except where the Administrator determines that the change in the description alters the fundamental nature of the actions to be taken and that public notice and comment will contribute to the decision-making process, in which case the permit revision will be treated as a permit modification or, at the option of the designated representative, a fast-track modification.</P>

              <P>(B) The designated representative of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall surrender allowances, and theAdministrator will deduct allowances, in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(C) of this section. The surrender and deduction of allowances as required under the prior sentence shall be the only remedy under the Act for a failure to meet the maximum annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate, provided that, if such deduction of allowance results in excess emissions, the remedies for excess emissions shall be fully applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Liability.</E> The owners and operators of a unit governed by an approved substitution plan shall be liable for any violation of the plan or this section at that unit or any other unit that is the first unit's substitution unit or for which the first unit is a substitution unit under the plan, including liability for fulfilling the obligations specified in part 77 of this chapter and section 411 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Termination.</E> (i) A substitution plan shall be in effect only in Phase I for the calendar years specified in the plan or until the calendar year for which a termination of the plan takes effect, provided that no substitution plan shall be terminated, and no unit shall be de-designated as a substitution <PRTPAGE P="54"/>unit, before the end of Phase I if the substitution unit serves as a control unit under a Phase I extension plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) To terminate a substitution plan for a given calendar year prior to the last year for which the plan was approved:</P>
              <P>(A) A notification to terminate in accordance with § 72.40(d) shall be submitted no later than 60 days before the allowance transfer deadline applicable to the given year; and</P>
              <P>(B) In the notification to terminate, the designated representative of each unit governed by the plan shall state that he or she surrenders for deduction from the unit's Allowance Tracking System account allowances equal in number to, and with the same or an earlier compliance use date as, those allocated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for all calendar years for which the plan is to be terminated. The designated representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted. In the absence of such identification, allowances will be deducted on a first-in, first-out basis under § 73.35(c)(2) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section are met and upon revision of the permit to terminate the substitution plan, the Administrator will deduct the allowances specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. No substitution plan shall be terminated, and no unit shall be de-designated as a Phase I unit, unless such deduction is made.</P>
              <P>(iv)(A) If there is a change in the ownership interest of the owners or operators of any unit under a substitution plan approved as meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section or a change in such owners' or operators' right to direct dispatch of electricity from a substitution unit under such a plan and the demonstration under paragraph (c)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section cannot be made, then the designated representatives of the units governed by this plan shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of the calendar year during which the change is made.</P>
              <P>(B) Where a substitution plan is approved as meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, if there is a change in the agreement under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section and a demonstration that the agreement, as changed, meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) cannot be made, then the designated representative of the units governed by the plan shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of the calendar year during which the change is made. Where a substitution plan is approved as meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, if the requirements of the first sentence of paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) of this section are not met during a calendar year, then the designated representative of the units governed by the plan shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of such calendar year.</P>
              <P>(C) If the plan is not terminated in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section, the Administrator, on his or her own motion, will terminate the plan and deduct the allowances required to be surrendered under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(D) Where a substitution unit and the Phase I unit designating the substitution unit in an approved substitution plan have a common owner, operator, or designated representative during a year, the plan shall not be terminated under paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) of this section with regard to the substitution unit if the year is as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section and the unit received from the Administrator for the year, under the Partial Settlement in <E T="03">Environmental Defense Fund</E> v. <E T="03">Carol M. Browner,</E> No. 93-1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (signed May 4, 1993), a total number of allowances equal to the unit's baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit's 1985 actual SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate or 1985 allowable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this section shall apply to the first year in Phase I for which the unit is and remains an active substitution unit.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the unit has a Group 1 boiler under part 76 of this chapter and is and <PRTPAGE P="55"/>remains an active substitution unit during 1995, paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D) of this section shall apply to 1995 and to the second year in Phase I for which the unit is and remains an active substitution unit.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If there is a change in the owners, operators, or designated representative of the substitution unit or the Phase I unit during a year under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section and, with the change, the units do not have a common owner, operator, or designated representative, then the designated representatives for such units shall submit a notification to terminate the plan so that the plan will terminate as of January 1 of the calendar year during which the change is made. If the plan is not terminated in accordance with the prior sentence, the Administrator, on his or her own motion, will terminate the plan and deduct the allowances required to be surrendered under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Where, as of November 15, 1990, a non-unit-specific federally enforceable or State enforceable emissions limitation covers the unit for any year during 1995-1999, the Administrator will specify on a case-by-case basis a method for using unit-specific and non-unit specific emissions limitations in approving or disapproving the compensating unit. The specified method will not treat a non-unit-specific emissions limitation as a unit-specific emissions limitation and will not result in compensating units retaining allowances allocated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for emissions reductions necessary to meet a non-unit-specific emissions limitation. Such method may require an end-of-year review and the disapproval and de-designation, and adjustment of the allowances allocated to, the compensating unit and may require the designated representative of the compensating unit to surrender allowances by the allowance transfer deadline of the year that is subject to the review. Any surrendered allowances shall have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances originally allocated for the year, and the designated representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted.

              <P>(B) In the notification to terminate, the designated representative of any compensating unit governed by the plan shall state that he or she surrenders for deduction from the unit's Allowance Tracking System account allowances equal in number to, and with the same or an earlier compliance use date as, those allocated under paragraph (d) of this section to each compensating unit for the calendar years for which the plan is to be terminated. The designated representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted.

If the amounts differ, the Administrator will determine: The number of allowances that should be deducted to offset any increase in excess emissions or returned to account for any decrease in excess emissions; and the amount of excess emissions penalty (excluding interest) that should be paid or returned to account for the change in excess emissions. The Administrator will deduct immediately from the unit's compliance subaccount the amount of allowances that he or she determines is necessary to offset any increase in excess emissions or will return immediately to the unit's compliance subaccount the amount of allowances that he or she determines is necessary to account for any decrease in excess emissions. The designated representative may identify the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted or returned. In the absence of such identification, the deduction will be on a first-in, first-out basis under § 73.35(b)(2) of this chapter and the return will be at the Administrator's discretion.</P>

              <P>(8) If the designated representative of a unit fails to submit on a timely basis a confirmation report (in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section) with regard to the estimate of expected kilowatt hour savings or improvement in heat rate from any energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measure under the reduced utilization plan, then the Administrator will reject such estimate and correct it to equal zero in the unit's annual compliance certification report that includes that estimate. The Administrator will deduct immediately, on a first-in, first-out basis under § 73.35(c)(2) of this chapter, the amount of allowances that he or she determines is necessary to offset <PRTPAGE P="85"/>any increase in excess emissions of sulfur dioxide that results from the correction and require the owners and operators to pay an excess emission penalty in accordance with part 77 of this chapter.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 72—Methodology for Annualization of Emissions Limits</HD>

              <P>For the purposes of the Acid Rain Program, 1985 emissions limits must be expressed in pounds of SO<E T="52">2</E> per million British Thermal Unit of heat input (lb/mmBtu) and expressed on an annual basis.</P>

              <P>Annualization factors are used to develop annual equivalent SO<E T="52">2</E> limits as required by section 402(18) of the CAA. Many emission limits are enforced on a shorter term basis (or averaging period) than annually. Because of the variability of sulfur in coal and, in some cases, scrubber performance, meeting a particular limit with an averaging period of less than a year and at a specified statutory emissions level would require a lower annual average SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate (or annual equivalent SO<E T="52">2</E> limit) than would the shorter term statutory limit. EPA has selected a compliance level of one exceedance per 10 years. For example, an SO<E T="52">2</E> emission limit of 1.2 lbs/MMBtu, enforced for a scrubbed unit over a 7-day averaging period, would result in an annualized SO<E T="52">2</E> emission limit of 1.16 lbs/MMBtu. In general, the shorter the averaging period, the lower the annual equivalent would be. Thus, the annualization of limits is established by multiplying each federally enforceable limit by an annualization factor that is determined by the averaging period and whether or not it's a scrubbed unit.<PRTPAGE P="90"/>

              <P>For the purposes of the Acid Rain Program, all emissions limits must be expressed in pounds of SO<E T="52">2</E> per million British Thermal Unit of heat input (lb/mmBtu).</P>

              <P>The factor for converting pounds of sulfur to pounds of SO<E T="52">2</E> is based on the molecular weights of sulfur (32) and SO<E T="52">2</E> (64). Limits expressed as percentage of sulfur or parts per million (ppm) depend on the energy content of the fuel and thus may vary, depending on several factors such as fuel heat content and atmospheric conditions. Generic conversions for these limits are based on the assumed average energy contents listed in table A-2. In addition, limits in ppm vary with boiler operation (e.g., load and excess air); generic conversions for these limits assume, conservatively, very low excess air. The remaining factors are based on site-specific heat rates and capacities to develop conversions for Btu per hour. Standard conversion factors for residual oil are 42 gal/bbl and 7.88 lbs/gal.</P>

Such authorized account representatives may specify a minimum price for the allowances offered at the auctions. The authorized account representative must notify the Administrator fifteen business days prior to the auctions, using the SO<E T="52">2</E> Allowance Offer Form published by the Administrator, or by means of electronic communication if the Administrator, following public notice, so requires or permits at some future time. The notification shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The compliance use date of the allowances offered;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of allowances to be sold and any other information identifying the allowances offered that may be required by subpart C of this part;</P>

              <P>(4) Whether the authorized account representative is willing to sell fewer allowances than the number stated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the full amount cannot be sold. After notification, the Administrator will deduct allowances from the appropriate Allowance Tracking System account from which allowances are being offered and place them in a separate subaccount for such allowances.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Conduct of the auctions.</E> (1) The Administrator will rank all bids in descending order of bid price starting with the highest. Allowances will be sold from the Auction Subaccount in this order at the amounts specified in the bids until there are no allowances in the subaccount. If all allowances are sold from the Auction Subaccount, including unsold allowances transferred from the preceding year's direct sale, and if bids still remain, the Administrator will sell allowances offered by the authorized account representatives, beginning with those offered at <PRTPAGE P="163"/>the lowest minimum price. Allowances offered at the lowest minimum price will be matched with the highest bid remaining after the Auction Subaccount is exhausted. Sales of offered allowances, including, but not limited to, allowances offered by more than one offeror at the same minimum bid price, will continue in ascending order of minimum price, starting with the lowest, and descending order of remaining bids, starting with the highest, until:</P>
              <P>(i) All allowances are sold,</P>
              <P>(ii) No bids remain, or</P>
              <P>(iii) Prices of remaining bids do not meet minimum prices required in remaining offers.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that there is more than one bid submitting the same price and the total number of allowances requested in all such bids exceeds the number of allowances remaining, the Administrator will award the remaining allowances by lottery to such bidders.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event that there are more offers of sale at the minimum price than there are bids meeting that price, allowances from all such offers will be sold to cover the bids, according to each such offeror's pro rata share of all allowances so offered.</P>
              <P>(4) In the event that fewer allowances remain than are requested in a bid, the Administrator will sell such remaining allowances to the bidder provided that, pursuant to § 73.71(b)(4), the bid states the bidder's willingness to purchase fewer allowances than requested in the bid.</P>
              <P>(5) In the event that fewer than all allowances included in an offer for sale would be sold to remaining bids based on price, the Administrator will sell such allowances to the bidder(s), provided that, pursuant to § 73.70(c)(4), the offer states the offeror's willingness to sell fewer allowances than were offered for sale.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Announcement of results.</E> Following each auction, the Administrator will publish the names of winning bidders and their bids, the amounts of losing bids, and the lowest price at which allowances are sold.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Transfer of allowances.</E> Allowances will be transferred from the Auction Subaccount and from the Allowance Tracking System account for allowances offered by authorized account representatives to the Allowance Tracking System accounts of successful bidders as soon as payment is collected by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Return of unsuccessful bids.</E> The Administrator will return payment to unsuccessful bidders and to bidders unwilling to purchase fewer allowances than requested following the conclusion of each auction.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Transfer of proceeds.</E> The Administrator will return all proceeds from the auction as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Allowances auctioned from the Auction Subaccount. Not later than 90 days following each auction, the Administrator will pay a pro rata share of the proceeds of each auction to the authorized account representative of each unit from whose annual allowance allocation allowances were withheld for the purposes of establishing the Auction Subaccount. Each unit's pro rata share will be calculated pursuant to regulations to be promulgated under subpart B.</P>
              <P>(2) Allowances contributed from others. Not later than 90 days following each auction, the Administrator will transfer the full amount of the proceeds of each sale of allowances offered by authorized account representatives to such representatives. Proceeds from the sale of allowances that were offered with the same specified minimum price will be distributed according to each such offeror's pro rata share of the sale of such allowances.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator will pay no interest on any payment made pursuant to paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Return of unsold allowances.</E> The Administrator will return all unsold allowances from the auction as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Allowances in the Auction Subaccount. At the conclusion of each auction, the Administrator will transfer to the Allowance Tracking System account of each source that includes a unit specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section its pro rata share of any allowances remaining in the Auction Subaccount. Each unit's pro rata share will be calculated pursuant to regulations to be promulgated under subpart B.<PRTPAGE P="164"/>

              <SUBJECT>Administrator's action on applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">First come, first served.</E> The Administrator will process and approve Allowance Reserve applications, in whole or in part, on a “first-come, first-served” basis as established by the order of date of receipt, provided that the Administrator shall not allocate more than a total of 30,000 allowances in connection with applications based on any one of the four categories of qualified renewable energy generation enumerated in § 73.81(c)(2)(i) and appendix A(3.1-3.4).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Deficient applications.</E> An application is deficient and will be returned by the Administrator if it fails to meet the requirements set forth in this subpart, including those set forth in § 73.82. A revised application that is submitted after being returned for failure to meet the requirements of this subpart will be processed according to the date of receipt of the revised application.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification of approval.</E> Applications that the Administrator determines to be complete and correct will be conditionally approved, subject to notification to EPA of a net income neutrality certification from the Department of Energy, within 120 calendar days of receipt. Allowances from the Reserve will be awarded subject to the Department of Energy certification, or, if a DOE certification has already been issued to the applicant, allocated to applicants from such applications depending on the availability of allowances in the Reserve. In the event the initial application approval is conditioned upon the Secretary of Energy's certification, final approval will be granted upon notification of certification by the Secretary of Energy pursuant to § 73.83. The Administrator will notify applicants of final approval in writing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Allocation of allowances.</E> Beginning in 1995, the Administrator will allocate allowances from the Reserve for each approved application into the applicant's account or accounts in the Allowance Tracking System. If the applicant does not have an account in the Allowance Tracking System, or wishes to open a new account for the allowances from the Reserve, an application pursuant to § 73.31(c) must accompany the application for Reserve allowances.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Partial fulfillment of requests.</E> (1) In the event that the allowances available in the Reserve are less than the number that could otherwise be allocated to an approved applicant's account under the application as approved, the applicant will receive the allowances remaining in the Reserve.</P>

              <P>(2) In the event that a subaccount is established by EPA, pursuant to § 73.85, and the applicant is making a request for allowances not included in the subaccount, the Allowance Reserve allocations for the approved applicant will be made, in addition to any that may be allocated pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) <PRTPAGE P="171"/>of this section, from any allowances remaining in the Reserve that are not contained in the subaccount.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Oversubscription of the Reserve.</E> (1) In the event that the Reserve becomes oversubscribed by more than one applicant on a single day, the allowances remaining in the Reserve will be distributed on a pro rata basis to applicants meeting the requirements of § 73.82.</P>
              <P>(2) If Reserve applications are received by the Administrator after all allowances from the Reserve have been allocated, the Administrator will so notify the applicant within 5 business days after receipt of the application.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event that applications meeting the requirements pursuant to § 73.82 are received by the Administrator prior to February 1, 1998, and</P>
              <P>(i) All remaining allowances in the Reserve have been placed in a subaccount pursuant to § 73.85; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicant is not eligible for an allocation of allowances from the subaccount; the application will be placed on a waiting list in order of receipt.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Administrator will notify the applicant of such action within 5 business days after receipt of the application.</P>
              <P>(4) If any allowances are returned to the Reserve after February 1, 1998 pursuant to § 73.85(c), the Administrator will review the wait-listed applications in order of receipt and allocate any remaining allowances to the approved applicants in the order of their receipt until no more allowances remain in the Reserve.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Applications for allowances based on the same avoided emissions from the same energy conservation measures or renewable energy generation</E>—(1) The Administrator will not award allowances to more than one applicant for the same avoided emissions from the same energy conservation measure or the same qualified renewable energy generation, and will process and act on such duplicative applications on a “first-come, first-serve” basis as determined by the order of date of receipt.</P>
              <P>(2) Any allowances awarded pursuant to two or more applications received on the same date based on the same avoided emissions from the same energy conservation measure or the same renewable electric generation will be divided equally between all such applicants unless the Administrator is otherwise directed by all such applicants.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrator review of the Reserve and creation of a subaccount.</E> In the event that an allocation of allowances from the Reserve pursuant to a pending application would bring the total number of allowances allocated to a number greater than 240,000, the Administrator will review the distribution of all allowances allocated as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) If at least 60,000 allowances have been allocated from the Reserve for <E T="03">each</E> of</P>
              <P>(i) Qualified energy conservation measures, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Qualified renewable energy generation, allocations of allowances will continue pursuant to § 73.82, until no more allowances remain in the Reserve.</P>
              <P>(2) If fewer than 60,000 allowances have been allocated for either qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewable energy generation, the Administrator will establish a subaccount for the allocation of allowances for applications based on the category for which fewer than 60,000 allowances have been allocated. The subaccount will contain allowances equal to 60,000 less the number of allowances previously allocated for such category.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Allocation of allowances from the subaccount.</E> The Administrator will allocate allowances from the subaccount established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to approved and DOE certified applicants that fulfill the requirements of this subpart, including § 73.82 and § 73.83, on a “first-come, first-served basis”, pursuant to § 73.84(a), until the subaccount is depleted or closed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Closure of the subaccount.</E> Unless all allowances in the subaccount have been previously allocated, the Administrator will terminate the subaccount not later than February 1, 1998 and return any allowances remaining in the subaccount to the general account of the Reserve. After all Reserve allocations have been made to applicants <PRTPAGE P="172"/>with approved and DOE certified applications subject to § 73.84(f)(3), the Administrator will allocate any remaining allowances to any applicants that meet the requirements of this subpart, including § 73.82 and § 73.83, on a “first-come, first-served” basis, pursuant to § 73.84.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Supplemental information.</E> Regardless of whether the opt-in permit application is complete, the Administrator or the permitting authority may request submission of any additional information that the Administrator or the permitting authority determines to be necessary in order to review the opt-in permit application or to issue an opt-in permit.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim review of monitoring plan.</E> The Administrator will determine, on an interim basis, the sufficiency of the monitoring plan, accompanying the opt-in permit application. A monitoring plan is sufficient, for purposes of interim review, if the plan appears to contain information demonstrating that all SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions, NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions, and opacity of the combustion or process source are monitored and reported in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. This interim review of sufficiency shall not be construed as the approval or disapproval of the combustion or process source's monitoring system.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Issuance of draft opt-in permit.</E> After the Administrator determines whether the combustion or process source's monitoring plan is sufficient under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the permitting authority shall serve the draft opt-in permit or the denial of a draft permit or the draft opt-in permit revisions or the denial of draft opt-in permit revisions on the designated representative of the combustion or process source submitting an opt-in permit application. A draft permit or draft opt-in permit revision shall not be served or issued if the monitoring plan is determined not to be sufficient.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Confirmation by source of intention to opt-in.</E> Within 21 calendar days from the date of service of the draft opt-in permit or the denial of the draft opt-in permit, the designated representative of a combustion or process source submitting an opt-in permit application must submit to the Administrator, in writing, a confirmation or recision of the source's intention to become an opt-in source under this part. The Administrator shall treat the failure to make a timely submission as a recision of the source's intention to become an opt-in source and as a withdrawal of the opt-in permit application.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Issuance of draft opt-in permit.</E> If the designated representative confirms the combustion or process source's intention to opt in under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the permitting authority will give notice of the draft opt-in permit or denial of the draft opt-in permit and an opportunity for public comment, as provided under § 72.65 of this chapter with regard to a draft permit or denial of a draft permit if the Administrator is the permitting authority or as provided in accordance with part 70 of this chapter with regard to a draft permit or the denial of a draft permit if the State is the permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Permit decision deadlines.</E> (i) If the Administrator is the permitting authority, an opt-in permit will be issued <PRTPAGE P="181"/>or denied within 12 months of receipt of a complete opt-in permit application.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the State is the permitting authority, an opt-in permit will be issued or denied within 18 months of receipt of a complete opt-in permit application or such lesser time approved for operating permits under part 70 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Withdrawal of opt-in permit application.</E> A combustion or process source may withdraw its opt-in permit application at any time prior to the issuance of the final opt-in permit. Once a combustion or process source withdraws its application, in order to re-apply, it must submit a new opt-in permit application in accordance with § 74.16 for combustion sources or § 74.17 for process sources.</P>
              <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Entry into Acid Rain Program</E>—(1) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> The effective date of the opt-in permit shall be the January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1 for a combustion or process source providing monthly data under § 74.20, or January 1 for a combustion or process source providing annual data under § 74.20, following the later of the issuance of the opt-in permit by the permitting authority or the completion of monitoring system certification, as provided in subpart F of this part for combustion sources or subpart G of this part for process sources. The combustion or process source shall become an opt-in source and an affected unit as of the effective date of the opt-in permit.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Allowance allocation.</E> After the opt-in permit becomes effective, the Administrator will allocate allowances to the opt-in source as provided in § 74.40. If the effective date of the opt-in permit is not January 1, allowances for the first year shall be pro-rated as provided in § 74.28.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Expiration of opt-in permit.</E> An opt-in permit that is issued before the completion of monitoring system certification under subpart F of this part for combustion sources or under subpart G of this part for process sources shall expire 180 days after the permitting authority serves the opt-in permit on the designated representative of the combustion or process source governed by the opt-in permit, unless such monitoring system certification is complete. The designated representative may petition the Administrator to extend this time period in which an opt-in permit expires and must explain in the petition why such an extension should be granted. The designated representative of a combustion source governed by an expired opt-in permit and that seeks to become an opt-in source must submit a new opt-in permit application.</P>

              <P>(iii) The owner or operator shall install, certify, operate, and maintain, in accordance with all the requirements of this part, a flow monitoring system and a CO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system that uses an O<E T="52">2</E> concentration monitor to determine CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions (according to the procedures in appendix F of this part) with an automated data acquisition and handling system for measuring and recording O<E T="52">2</E> concentration (in percent), CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration (in percent), volumetric gas flow (in scfh), and CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions (in tons/hr) discharged to the atmosphere;</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall install, certify, operate, and maintain, in accordance with all the requirements in this part, a continuous opacity monitoring system with the automated data acquisition and handling system for measuring and recording the opacity of emissions (in percent opacity) discharged to the atmosphere, except as provided in §§ 75.14 and 75.18; and</P>
              <P>(5) A single certified flow monitoring system may be used to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section. A single certified diluent monitor may be used to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section. A single automated data acquisition and handling system may be used to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Primary Equipment Performance Requirements.</E> The owner or operator shall ensure that each continuous emission monitoring system required by this part meets the equipment, installation, and performance specifications in appendix A to this part; and is maintained according to the quality assurance and quality control procedures in appendix B to this part; and shall record SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions in the appropriate units of measurement (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, lb/hr for SO<E T="52">2</E> and lb/mmBtu for NO<E T="52">X</E>).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Heat Input Rate Measurement Requirement.</E> The owner or operator shall determine and record the heat input rate, in units of mmBtu/hr, to each affected unit for every hour or part of an hour any fuel is combusted following the procedures in appendix F to this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Primary equipment hourly operating requirements.</E> The owner or operator shall ensure that all continuous emission and opacity monitoring systems required by this part are in operation and monitoring unit emissions or opacity at all times that the affected unit <PRTPAGE P="217"/>combusts any fuel except as provided in § 75.11(e) and during periods of calibration, quality assurance, or preventive maintenance, performed pursuant to § 75.21 and appendix B of this part, periods of repair, periods of backups of data from the data acquisition and handling system, or recertification performed pursuant to § 75.20. The owner or operator shall also ensure, subject to the exceptions above in this paragraph, that all continuous opacity monitoring systems required by this part are in operation and monitoring opacity during the time following combustion when fans are still operating, unless fan operation is not required to be included under any other applicable Federal, State, or local regulation, or permit. The owner or operator shall ensure that the following requirements are met:</P>

              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall ensure that each continuous emission monitoring system is capable of completing a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-min interval. The owner or operator shall reduce all SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations, volumetric flow, SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions, CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration, O<E T="52">2</E> concentration, CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions (if applicable), NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, and NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data collected by the monitors to hourly averages. Hourly averages shall be computed using at least one data point in each fifteen minute quadrant of an hour, where the unit combusted fuel during that quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant of an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of the performance of calibration, quality assurance, or preventive maintenance activities pursuant to § 75.21 and appendix B of this part, or backups of data from the data acquisition and handling system, or recertification, pursuant to § 75.20. The owner or operator shall use all valid measurements or data points collected during an hour to calculate the hourly averages. All data points collected during an hour shall be, to the extent practicable, evenly spaced over the hour.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator shall ensure that each continuous opacity monitoring system is capable of completing a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-sec period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-min period. The owner or operator shall reduce all opacity data to 6-min averages calculated in accordance with the provisions of part 51, appendix M of this chapter, except where the applicable State implementation plan or operating permit requires a different averaging period, in which case the State requirement shall satisfy this Acid Rain Program requirement.</P>
              <P>(3) Failure of an SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, or O<E T="52">2</E> emissions concentration monitor, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitor, flow monitor, moisture monitor, or NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system to acquire the minimum number of data points for calculation of an hourly average in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall result in the failure to obtain a valid hour of data and the loss of such component data for the entire hour. For a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring system, an hourly average NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in lb/mmBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points is acquired by both the NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitor and the diluent monitor (O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E>). For a moisture monitoring system consisting of one or more oxygen analyzers capable of measuring O<E T="52">2</E> on a wet-basis and a dry-basis, an hourly average percent moisture value is valid only if the minimum number of data points is acquired for both the wet-and dry-basis measurements. If a valid hour of data is not obtained, the owner or operator shall estimate and record emissions, moisture, or flow data for the missing hour by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, in accordance with the applicable procedure for missing data substitution in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Optional backup monitor requirements.</E> If the owner or operator chooses to use two or more continuous emission monitoring systems, each of which is capable of monitoring the same stack or duct at a specific affected unit, or group of units using a common stack, then the owner or operator shall designate one monitoring system as <PRTPAGE P="218"/>the primary monitoring system, and shall record this information in the monitoring plan, as provided for in § 75.53. The owner or operator shall designate the other monitoring system(s) as backup monitoring system(s) in the monitoring plan. The backup monitoring system(s) shall be designated as redundant backup monitoring system(s), non-redundant backup monitoring system(s), or reference method backup system(s), as described in § 75.20(d). When the certified primary monitoring system is operating and not out-of-control as defined in § 75.24, only data from the certified primary monitoring system shall be reported as valid, quality-assured data. Thus, data from the backup monitoring system may be reported as valid, quality-assured data only when the backup is operating and not out-of-control as defined in § 75.24 (or in the applicable reference method in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter) and when the certified primary monitoring system is not operating (or is operating but out-of-control). A particular monitor may be designated both as a certified primary monitor for one unit and as a certified redundant backup monitor for another unit.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Minimum measurement capability requirement.</E> The owner or operator shall ensure that each continuous emission monitoring system is capable of accurately measuring, recording, and reporting data, and shall not incur an exceedance of the full scale range, except as provided in sections 2.1.1.5, 2.1.2.5, and 2.1.4.3 of appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Minimum recording and recordkeeping requirements.</E> The owner or operator shall record and the designated representative shall report the hourly, daily, quarterly, and annual information collected under the requirements of this part as specified in subparts F and G of this part.</P>

              <P>(B) Install, certify, operate, and maintain an SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system in the duct from each nonaffected unit; determine SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions from the affected units as the difference between SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions measured in the common stack and SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions measured in the ducts of the nonaffected units, not to be reported as an hourly average value less than zero; combine emissions for the Phase I and Phase II affected units for recordkeeping and compliance purposes; and calculate and report SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions from the Phase I and Phase II affected units, pursuant to an approach approved by the Administrator, such that these emissions are not underestimated; or</P>

              <P>(C) Record the combined emissions from all units as the combined SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions for the Phase I and Phase II affected units for recordkeeping and compliance purposes; or</P>

              <P>(D) Petition through the designated representative and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on methods for apportioning SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions measured in the common stack to each of the units using the common stack and on reporting the SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions. The Administrator <PRTPAGE P="224"/>may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning and reporting SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions measured in a common stack whenever the demonstration ensures that there is a complete and accurate accounting of all emissions regulated under this part and, in particular, that the emissions from any affected unit are not underestimated.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Unit with bypass stack.</E> Whenever any portion of the flue gases from an affected unit can be routed through a bypass stack so as to avoid the installed SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system, the owner or operator shall either:</P>

              <P>(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain separate SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring systems and flow monitoring systems on the main stack and the bypass stack and calculate SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions for the unit as the sum of the SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions measured at the two stacks; or</P>
              <P>(2) Monitor SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions at the main stack using SO<E T="52">2</E> and flow rate monitoring systems and measure SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions at the bypass stack using the reference methods in § 75.22(b) for SO<E T="52">2</E> and flow rate and calculate SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions for the unit as the sum of the emissions recorded by the installed monitoring systems on the main stack and the emissions measured by the reference method monitoring systems; or</P>
              <P>(3) Install, certify, operate, and maintain SO<E T="52">2</E> and flow rate monitoring systems only on the main stack. If this option is chosen, report the following values for each hour during which emissions pass through the bypass stack: the maximum potential concentration of SO<E T="52">2</E> as determined under section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part (or, if available, the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration measured by a certified monitor located at the control device inlet may be reported instead), and the hourly volumetric flow rate value that would be substituted for the flow monitor installed on the main stack or flue under the missing data procedures in subpart D of this part if data from the flow monitor installed on the main stack or flue were missing for the hour. The maximum potential SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration may be specific to the type of fuel combusted in the unit during the bypass (<E T="03">see</E> § 75.33(b)(5)). The option in this paragraph, (c)(3), may only be used if use of the bypass stack is limited to unit startup, emergency situations (e.g., malfunction of a flue gas desulfurization system), and periods of routine maintenance of the flue gas desulfurization system or maintenance on the main stack. If this option is chosen, it is not necessary to designate the exhaust configuration as a multiple stack configuration in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53, with respect to SO<E T="52">2</E> or any other parameter that is monitored only at the main stack. Calculate SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions for the unit as the sum of the emissions calculated with the substitute values and the emissions recorded by the SO<E T="52">2</E> and flow monitoring systems installed on the main stack.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unit with multiple stacks or ducts.</E> When the flue gases from an affected unit utilize two or more ducts feeding into two or more stacks (that may include flue gases from other affected or nonaffected units), or when the flue gases utilize two or more ducts feeding into a single stack and the owner or operator chooses to monitor in the ducts rather than the stack, the owner or operator shall either:</P>
              <P>(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain an SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system in each duct feeding into the stack or stacks and determine SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions from each affected unit as the sum of the SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions recorded for each duct; or</P>
              <P>(2) Install, certify, operate, and maintain an SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system in each stack. Determine SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions from each affected unit as the sum of the SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions recorded for each stack. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, if another unit also exhausts flue gases to one or more of the stacks, the owner or operator shall also comply with the applicable common stack requirements of this section to determine and record SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions from the units using that stack and shall calculate and report SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions from the affected <PRTPAGE P="225"/>units and stacks, pursuant to an approach approved by the Administrator, such that these emissions are not underestimated.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Heat input rate.</E> The owner or operator of an affected unit using a common stack, bypass stack, or multiple stacks shall account for heat input rate according to the following:</P>

              <P>(1) The owner or operator of an affected unit using a common stack, bypass stack, or multiple stack with a diluent monitor and a flow monitor on each stack may use the flow rate and diluent monitors to determine the heat input rate for the affected unit, using the procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, except that the term “heat input rate” shall apply rather than “SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions” or “emissions” and the phrase “a diluent monitor and a flow monitor” shall apply rather than “SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system.” The applicable equation in appendix F to this part shall be used to calculate the heat input rate from the hourly flow rate, diluent monitor measurements, and (if the equation in appendix F requires a correction for the stack gas moisture content) hourly moisture measurements. Notwithstanding the options for combining heat input rate in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit with a diluent monitor and a flow monitor installed on a common stack to determine the combined heat input rate at the common stack shall also determine and report heat input rate to each individual unit, according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that an owner or operator of a unit with a bypass stack does not install and certify a diluent monitor and flow monitoring system in a bypass stack, the owner or operator shall determine total heat input rate to the unit for each unit operating hour during which the bypass stack is used according to the missing data provisions for heat input rate under § 75.36 or the procedures for calculating heat input rate from fuel sampling and analysis in section 5.5 of appendix F to this part.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator of an affected unit with a diluent monitor and a flow monitor installed on a common stack to determine heat input rate at the common stack may choose to apportion the heat input rate from the common stack to each affected unit utilizing the common stack by using either of the following two methods, provided that all of the units utilizing the common stack are combusting fuel with the same F-factor found in section 3 of appendix F of this part. The heat input rate may be apportioned either by using the ratio of load (in MWe) for each individual unit to the total load for all units utilizing the common stack or by using the ratio of steam load (in 1000 lb/hr or mmBtu/hr thermal output) for each individual unit to the total steam load for all units utilizing the common stack, in conjunction with the appropriate unit and stack operating times. If using either of these apportionment methods, the owner or operator shall apportion according to section 5.6 of appendix F to this part.</P>

              <P>(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, any affected unit that is using the procedures in this part to meet the monitoring and reporting requirements of a State or federal NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emission reduction program must also meet the requirements for monitoring heat input rate in §§ 75.71, 75.72 and 75.75.</P>

              <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit that is using the procedures in this part to meet the monitoring and reporting requirements of a State or federal NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emission reduction program must also meet the provisions for monitoring NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in §§ 75.71 and 75.72.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Unit utilizing common stack with other affected unit(s).</E> When an affected unit utilizes a common stack with one <PRTPAGE P="226"/>or more affected units, but no nonaffected units, the owner or operator shall either:</P>
              <P>(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E> continuous emission monitoring system in the duct to the common stack from each affected unit; or</P>
              <P>(2) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E> continuous emission monitoring system in the common stack and follow the appropriate procedure in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section, depending on whether or not the units are required to comply with a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation (in lb/mmBtu, annual average basis) pursuant to section 407(b) of the Act (referred to hereafter as “NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation”).</P>
              <P>(i) When each of the affected units has a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation, the designated representative shall submit a compliance plan to the Administrator that indicates:</P>
              <P>(A) Each unit will comply with the most stringent NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation of any unit utilizing the common stack; or</P>
              <P>(B) Each unit will comply with the applicable NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation by averaging its emissions with the other unit(s) utilizing the common stack, pursuant to the emissions averaging plan submitted under part 76 of this chapter; or</P>
              <P>(C) Each unit's compliance with the applicable NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit will be determined by a method satisfactory to the Administrator for apportioning to each of the units the combined NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) measured in the common stack and for reporting the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as provided in a petition submitted by the designated representative. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning and reporting NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate measured in a common stack whenever the demonstration ensures that there is a complete and accurate estimation of all emissions regulated under this part and, in particular, that the emissions from any unit with a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation are not underestimated.</P>
              <P>(ii) When none of the affected units has a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation, the owner or operator and the designated representative have no additional obligations pursuant to section 407 of the Act and may record and report a combined NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) for the affected units utilizing the common stack.</P>

              <P>(iii) When at least one of the affected units has a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation and at least one of the affected units does not have a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limitation, the owner or operator shall either:</P>
              <P>(A) Install, certify, operate, and maintain NO<E T="52">X</E> and diluent monitors in the ducts from the affected units; or</P>

              <P>(B) Develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on methods for apportioning the combined NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) measured in the common stack on each of the units. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning the combined NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate measured in a common stack whenever the demonstration ensures complete and accurate estimation of all emissions regulated under this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Unit utilizing common stack with nonaffected unit(s).</E> When one or more affected units utilizes a common stack with one or more nonaffected units, the owner or operator shall either:</P>
              <P>(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system in the duct from each affected unit; or</P>

              <P>(2) Develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to the Administrator on methods for apportioning the combined NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) measured in the common stack for each of the units. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for apportioning the combined NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate measured in a common stack whenever the demonstration ensures complete and accurate estimation of all emissions regulated under this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Unit with multiple stacks or ducts.</E> When the flue gases from an affected unit discharge to the atmosphere through two or more stacks or when flue gases from an affected unit utilize two or more ducts feeding into a single stack and the owner or operator chooses to monitor in the ducts rather than the stack, the owner or operator shall monitor the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in a <PRTPAGE P="227"/>way that is representative of each affected unit. Where another unit also exhausts flue gases to one or more of the stacks where monitoring systems are installed, the owner or operator shall also comply with the applicable common stack monitoring requirements of this section. The owner or operator shall either:</P>
              <P>(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system and a flow monitoring system in each stack or duct and determine the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for the unit as the Btu-weighted average of the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates measured in the stacks or ducts using the heat input estimation procedures in appendix F to this part. Alternatively, for units that are eligible to use the procedures of appendix D to this part, the owner or operator may monitor heat input and NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate at the unit level, in lieu of installing flow monitors on each stack or duct. If this alternative unit-level monitoring is performed, report, for each unit operating hour, the highest emission rate measured by any of the NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring systems installed on the individual stacks or ducts as the hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for the unit, and report the hourly unit heat input as determined under appendix D to this part. Also, when this alternative unit-level monitoring is performed, the applicable NO<E T="52">X</E> missing data procedures in §§ 75.31 or 75.33 shall be used for each unit operating hour in which a quality-assured NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate is not obtained for one or more of the individual stacks or ducts; or</P>

              <P>(2) Provided that the products of combustion are well-mixed, install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E> continuous emission monitoring system in one stack or duct from the affected unit and record the monitored value as the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for the unit. The owner or operator shall account for NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions from the unit during all times when the unit combusts fuel. Therefore, this option shall not be used if the monitored stack or duct can be bypassed (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by using dampers). Follow the procedure in § 75.17(d) for units with bypass stacks. Further, this option shall not be used unless the monitored NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate truly represents the NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions discharged to the atmosphere (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the option is disallowed if there are any additional NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls downstream of the monitored location).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unit with a main stack and bypass stack configuration.</E> For an affected unit with a discharge configuration consisting of a main stack and a bypass stack, the owner or operator shall either:</P>
              <P>(1) Follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(2) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS only on the main stack. If this option is chosen, it is not necessary to designate the exhaust configuration as a multiple stack configuration in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53, with respect to NO<E T="52">X</E> or any other parameter that is monitored only at the main stack. For each unit operating hour in which the bypass stack is used and the emissions are either uncontrolled (or the add-on controls are not documented to be operating properly), report the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter). The maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate may be specific to the type of fuel combusted in the unit during the bypass (see § 75.33(c)(8)). Alternatively, for a unit with NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission controls, for each unit operating hour in which the bypass stack is used and the add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls are not bypassed, the owner or operator may report the maximum controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MCR) instead of the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate provided that the add-on controls are documented to be operating properly, as described in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit, required by section 1 in appendix B of this part. To provide the necessary documentation, the owner or operator shall record parametric data to verify the proper operation of the NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission controls as described in § 75.34(d). Furthermore, the owner or operator shall calculate the MCR using the procedure described in section 2.1.2.1(b) of appendix A to this part where the words “maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MER)” shall apply <PRTPAGE P="228"/>instead of the words “maximum controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MCR)” and by using the NO<E T="52">X</E> MEC in the calculations instead of the NO<E T="52">X</E> MPC.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Optional SO 2, NO <E T="0732">X</E>, and CO 2 emissions calculation for low mass emissions (LME) units.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability and qualification.</E> (1) For units that meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(1) and paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, the low mass emissions (LME) excepted methodology in paragraph (c) of this section may be used in lieu of continuous emission monitoring systems or, if applicable, in lieu of methods under appendices D, E, and G to this part, for the purpose of determining unit heat input, NO<E T="52">X</E>, SO<E T="52">2</E>, and CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions, and NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate under this part. If the owner or operator of a qualifying unit elects to use the LME methodology, it must be used for all parameters that are required to be monitored by the applicable program(s). For example, for an Acid Rain Program LME unit, the methodology must be used to estimate SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, and CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions, NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, and unit heat input.</P>
              <P>(i) A low mass emissions unit is an affected unit that is gas-fired, or oil-fired (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), and for which:</P>
              <P>(A) An initial demonstration is provided, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, which shows that the unit emits:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) No more than 25 tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> annually and less than 100 tons of NO<E T="52">X</E> annually, for Acid Rain Program affected units. If the unit is also subject to the provisions of subpart H of this part, no more than 50 of the allowable annual tons of NO<E T="52">X</E> may be emitted during the ozone season; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Less than 100 tons of NO<E T="52">X</E> annually <E T="03">and</E> no more than 50 tons of NO<E T="52">X</E> during the ozone season, for non-Acid <PRTPAGE P="229"/>Rain Program units subject to the provisions of subpart H of this part, for which the owner or operator reports emissions data on a year-round basis, in accordance with § 75.74(a) or § 75.74(b); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) No more than 50 tons of NO<E T="52">X</E> per ozone season, for non-Acid Rain Program units subject to the provisions of subpart H of this part, for which the owner or operator reports emissions data only during the ozone season, in accordance with § 75.74(b); and</P>

              <P>(B) An annual demonstration is provided thereafter, using one of the allowable methodologies in paragraph (c) of this section, showing that the low mass emissions unit continues to emit no more than the applicable number of tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section.</P>

              <P>(C) This paragraph, (a)(1)(i)(C), applies only to a unit that is subject to an SO<E T="52">2</E> emission limitation under the Acid Rain Program, and that combusts a gaseous fuel other than pipeline natural gas or natural gas (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter). The owner or operator of such a unit must quantify the sulfur content and variability of the gaseous fuel by performing the demonstration described in section 2.3.6 of appendix D to this part, in order for the unit to qualify for LME unit status. If the results of that demonstration show that the gaseous fuel qualifies under paragraph (b) of section 2.3.6 to use a default SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate to report SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions under this part, the unit is eligible for LME unit status.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each qualifying LME unit must start using the low mass emissions excepted methodology as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For a unit that reports emission data on a year-round basis, begin using the methodology in the first unit operating hour in the calendar year designated in the certification application as the first year that the methodology will be used; or</P>
              <P>(B) For a unit that is subject to Subpart H of this part and that reports only during the ozone season according to § 75.74(c), begin using the methodology in the first unit operating hour in the ozone season designated in the certification application as the first ozone season that the methodology will be used.</P>
              <P>(C) For a new or newly-affected unit, see paragraph (b)(4) of this section for additional guidance.</P>
              <P>(2) A unit may initially qualify as a low mass emissions unit if the designated representative submits a certification application to use the LME methodology (as described in § 75.63(a)(1)(ii) and in this paragraph, (a)(2)) and the Administrator (or permitting authority, as applicable) certifies the use of such methodology. The certification application shall be submitted no later than 45 days prior to the date on which use of the low mass emissions methodology is expected to commence, and the application must contain:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement identifying the projected date on which the LME methodology will first be used. The projected commencement date shall be consistent with paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (b)(4) of this section, as applicable; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Either:</P>
              <P>(A) Actual SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions data (as applicable) for each of the three calendar years (or ozone seasons) prior to the calendar year in which the certification application is submitted demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator or (if applicable) the permitting authority, that the unit emitted less than the applicable number of tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. For the purposes of this paragraph, (a)(2)(ii)(A), the required actual SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions for each qualifying year or ozone season shall be determined using the SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E> and heat input data reported to the Administrator in the electronic quarterly reports required under § 75.64 or under the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) NO<E T="52">X</E> Budget Trading Program. Notwithstanding this requirement, in the absence of such electronic reports, an estimate of the actual emissions for each of the previous three years (or ozone seasons) shall be provided, using either the maximum rated heat input methodology described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section or procedures consistent with the long term fuel flow heat input methodology described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, in <PRTPAGE P="230"/>conjunction with the appropriate SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate from paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for SO<E T="52">2</E>, and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (c)(1)(iv) of this section for NO<E T="52">X</E>. Alternatively, the initial estimate of the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate may be based on historical emission test data that is representative of operation at normal load or historical data from a CEMS certified under part 60 of this chapter or under a state CEM program; or</P>

              <P>(B) When the three full years (or ozone seasons) of actual SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions data (or reliable estimates thereof) described under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section do not exist, the designated representative may submit an application to use the low mass emissions excepted methodology based upon a combination of actual historical SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions data and projected SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions, totaling three years (or ozone seasons). Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, actual data must be used for any years (or ozone seasons) in which such data exists and projected data should be used for any remaining future years (or ozone seasons) needed to provide emissions data for three consecutive calendar years (or ozone seasons). For example, if a unit commenced operation two years ago, the designated representative may submit actual, historical data for the previous two years and one year of projected emissions for the current calendar year or, for a new unit, the designated representative may submit three years of projected emissions, beginning with the current calendar year. Any actual or projected annual emissions must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the unit will emit less than the applicable number of tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. Projected emissions shall be calculated using either the appropriate default emission rates from paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section (or, alternatively for NO<E T="52">X</E>, a conservative estimate of the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section), in conjunction with projections of unit operating hours or fuel type and fuel usage, according to one of the allowable calculation methodologies in paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of the methodology from paragraph (c) of this section that will be used to demonstrate on-going compliance under paragraph (b) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Appropriate documentation demonstrating that the unit is eligible to use projected emissions to qualify for LME status under paragraph (a)(3) of this section (if applicable).</P>
              <P>(3) In the following circumstances, projected emissions for a future year (or years) may be used in lieu of the actual emissions data from one (or more) of the three years (or ozone seasons) preceding the year of the certification application:</P>

              <P>(i) If the owner or operator takes an enforceable permit restriction on the number of annual or ozone season unit operating hours for the future year (or years), such that the unit will emit no more than the applicable number of tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If the actual emissions for one (or more) of the three years (or ozone seasons) prior to the year of the certification application is not representative of the present and expected future emissions from the unit, because the owner or operator has recently installed emission controls on the unit.</P>

              <P>(4) When the owner or operator elects to demonstrate initial LME qualification and on-going compliance using a fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, there will be instances (e.g., for a new or newly-affected unit) where it is not possible to determine that NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate prior to submitting the certification application. In such cases, if the generic default NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates in Table LM-2 of this section are inappropriately high for the unit, the owner or operator may use a more representative, but conservatively high estimate of the expected NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, for the purposes of the initial monitoring plan submittal and to calculate the unit's projected annual or ozone season emissions under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. For example, the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate could, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="231"/>be estimated using historical CEM data or historical emission test data that is representative of operation at normal load. The NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit specified in the operating permit for the unit could also be used to estimate the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (except for units equipped with SCR or SNCR), or, consistent with paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section, for a unit that uses SCR or SNCR to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, an estimated default NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate of 0.15 lb/mmBtu could be used. However, these estimated NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates may not be used for reporting purposes in the time period extending from the first hour in which the LME methodology is used to the date and hour on which the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate testing is completed. Rather, in that interval, the owner or operator shall either report the appropriate default NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate from Table LM-2, or shall report the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, calculated in accordance with § 72.2 of this chapter and section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part. Then, beginning with the first unit operating hour after completion of the tests, the appropriate default NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate(s) obtained from the fuel-and-unit-specific testing shall be used for emissions reporting.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">On-going qualification and disqualification.</E> (1) Once a low mass emissions unit has qualified for and has started using the low mass emissions excepted methodology, an annual demonstration is required, showing that the unit continues to emit no more than the applicable number of tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. The calculation methodology used for the annual demonstration shall be the methodology described in the certification application under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) If any low mass emissions unit fails to provide the required annual demonstration under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, such that the calculated cumulative emissions for the unit exceed the applicable number of tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section at the end of any calendar year or ozone season, then:</P>
              <P>(i) The low mass emissions unit shall be disqualified from using the low mass emissions excepted methodology; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The owner or operator of the low mass emissions unit shall install and certify monitoring systems that meet the requirements of §§ 75.11, 75.12, and 75.13, and shall report SO<E T="52">2</E> (Acid Rain Program units, only), NO<E T="52">X</E>, and CO<E T="52">2</E> (Acid Rain Program units, only) emissions data and heat input data from such monitoring systems by December 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the unit exceeded the number of tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(iii) If the required monitoring systems have not been installed and certified by the applicable deadline in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator shall report the following values for each unit operating hour, beginning with the first operating hour after the deadline and continuing until the monitoring systems have been provisionally certified: the maximum potential hourly heat input for the unit, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter; the SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions, in lb/hr, calculated using the applicable default SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate from paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and the maximum potential hourly unit heat input; the CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions, in tons/hr, calculated using the applicable default CO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate from paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section and the maximum potential hourly unit heat input; and the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(3) If a low mass emissions unit that initially qualifies to use the low mass emissions excepted methodology under this section changes fuels, such that a fuel other than those allowed for use in the low mass emissions methodology is combusted in the unit, the unit shall be disqualified from using the low mass emissions excepted methodology as of the first hour that the new fuel is combusted in the unit. The owner or operator shall install and certify SO<E T="52">2</E> (Acid Rain Program units, only), NO<E T="52">X</E>, and CO<E T="52">2</E> (Acid Rain Program units, only) and flow (if necessary) monitoring systems that meet the requirements of §§ 75.11, 75.12, and 75.13 prior to a change <PRTPAGE P="232"/>to such fuel, and shall report emissions data from such monitoring systems beginning with the date and hour on which the new fuel is first combusted in the unit. If the required monitoring systems are not installed and certified prior to the fuel switch, the owner or operator shall report (as applicable) the maximum potential concentration of SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E>, the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, the maximum potential flowrate, the maximum potential hourly heat input and the maximum (or minimum, if appropriate) potential moisture percentage, from the date and hour of the fuel switch until the monitoring systems are certified or until probationary calibration error tests of the monitors are passed and the conditional data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) begin to be used. All maximum and minimum potential values shall be specific to the new fuel and shall be determined in a manner consistent with section 2 of appendix A to this part and § 72.2 of this chapter. The owner or operator must notify the Administrator (or the permitting authority) in the case where a unit switches fuels without previously having installed and certified a SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system meeting the requirements of §§ 75.11, 75.12, and 75.13.</P>
              <P>(4) If a new of newly-affected unit initially qualifies to use the low mass emissions excepted methodology under this section and the owner or operator wants to use the low mass emissions methodology for the unit, he or she must:</P>

              <P>(i) Keep the records specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, beginning with the date and hour of commencement of commercial operation, for a new unit subject to an Acid Rain emission limitation, and beginning with the date and hour of the commencement of operation, for a new unit subject to a NO<E T="52">X</E> mass reduction program under subpart H of this part. For newly-affected units, the records in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be kept as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For Acid Rain Program units, begin keeping the records as of the first hour of commercial operation of the unit following the date on which the unit becomes affected; or</P>
              <P>(B) For units subject to a NO<E T="52">X</E> mass reduction program under subpart H of this part, begin keeping the records as of the first hour of unit operation following the date on which the unit becomes an affected unit;</P>

              <P>(ii) Use these records to determine the cumulative heat input and SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions in order to continue to qualify as a low mass emissions unit; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Determine the cumulative SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions according to paragraph (c) of this section using the same procedures used after the certification deadline for the unit, for purposes of demonstrating eligibility to use the excepted methodology set forth in this section. For example, use the default emission rates in Tables LM-1, LM-2, and LM-3 of this section or use the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate determined according to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. For Acid Rain Program LME units, the Administrator will not count SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions calculated for the period between commencement of commercial operation and the certification deadline for the unit under § 75.4 against SO<E T="52">2</E> allowances to be held in the unit account.</P>

              <P>(5) A low mass emissions unit that has been disqualified from using the low mass emissions excepted methodology may subsequently submit an application to qualify again to use the low mass emissions methodology under paragraph (a)(2) of this section only if, following the non-compliant year (or ozone season), at least three full years (or ozone seasons) of actual, monitored emissions data is obtained showing that the unit emitted no more than the applicable number of tons of SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. Further, the designated representative or authorized account representative must certify in the application that the unit operation for the years or ozone seasons for which the emissions were monitored are representative of the projected future operation of the unit.</P>

              </P>

              <P>(i) If the unit combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, use Table LM-1 of <PRTPAGE P="233"/>this section to determine the appropriate SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate for use in calculating hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions under this section. Alternatively, for fuel oil combustion, a lower, fuel-specific SO<E T="52">2</E> emission factor may be used in lieu of the applicable emission factor from Table LM-1, if a federally enforceable permit condition is in place that limits the sulfur content of the oil. If this alternative is chosen, the fuel-specific SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate in lb/mmBtu shall be calculated by multiplying the fuel sulfur content limit (weight percent sulfur) by 1.01. In addition, the owner or operator shall periodically determine the sulfur content of the oil combusted in the unit, using one of the oil sampling and analysis options described in section 2.2 of appendix D to this part, and shall keep records of these fuel sampling results in a format suitable for inspection and auditing. Alternatively, the required oil sampling and associated recordkeeping may be performed using a consensus standard (e.g., ASTM, API, etc.) that is prescribed in the unit's Federally-enforceable operating permit, in an applicable State regulation, or in another applicable Federal regulation. If the unit combusts gaseous fuel(s) other than natural gas, the owner or operator shall use the procedures in section 2.3.6 of appendix D to this part to document the total sulfur content of each such fuel and to determine the appropriate default SO2 emission rate for each such fuel.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the unit combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, use either the appropriate NO<E T="52">X</E> emission factor from Table LM-2 of this section, or a fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate determined according to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, to calculate hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions under this section. If the unit combusts a gaseous fuel other than pipeline natural gas or natural gas, the owner or operator shall determine a fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate according to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the unit combusts only natural gas and/or fuel oil, use Table LM-3 of this section to determine the appropriate CO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate for use in calculating hourly CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions under this section (Acid Rain Program units, only). If the unit combusts a gaseous fuel other than pipeline natural gas or natural gas, the owner or operator shall determine a fuel-and-unit-specific CO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate for the fuel, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Derive a carbon-based F-factor for the fuel, using fuel sampling and analysis, as described in section 3.3.6 of appendix F to this part; and</P>

              <P>(B) Use Equation G-4 in appendix G to this part to derive the default CO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate. Rearrange the equation, solving it for the ratio of W<E T="52">CO2</E>/H (this ratio will yield an emission rate, in units of tons/mmBtu). Then, substitute the carbon-based F-factor determined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section into the rearranged equation to determine the default CO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate for the unit.</P>
              <P>(iv) In lieu of using the default NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate from Table LM-2 of this section, the owner or operator may, for each fuel combusted by a low mass emissions unit, determine a fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for the purpose of calculating NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions under this section. This option may be used by any unit which qualifies to use the low mass emission excepted methodology under paragraph (a) of this section, and also by groups of units which combust fuel from a common source of supply and which use the long term fuel flow methodology under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to determine heat input. The testing must be completed in a timely manner, such that the test results are reported electronically no later than the end of the calendar year or ozone season in which the LME methodology is first used. If this option is chosen, the following procedures shall be used.</P>

              <P>(A) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(F), (c)(1)(iv)(G), and (c)(1)(iv)(I) of this section, determine a fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate by conducting a four load NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate test procedure as specified in section 2.1 of appendix E to this part, for each type of fuel combusted in the unit. For a group of units sharing a common fuel supply, the appendix E testing must be performed on each individual unit in the group, unless some or all of the units in the group belong to an identical group of <PRTPAGE P="234"/>units, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, in which case, representative testing may be conducted on units in the identical group of units, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section. For the purposes of this section, make the following modifications to the appendix E test procedures:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Do not measure the heat input as required under 2.1.3 of appendix E to this part.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Do not plot the test results as specified under 2.1.6 of appendix E to this part.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Do not correct the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration to 15% O<E T="52">2</E>.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If the testing is performed on an uncontrolled diffusion flame turbine, a correction to the observed average NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration from each run of the test must be applied using the following Equation LM-1a.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) For an individual combustion turbine (or a group of identical turbines) that operate principally at base load (or at a set point temperature), but are capable of operating at a higher peak load (or higher internal operating temperature), the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for the unit (or for each unit in the group) shall be as follows:</P>

              <P>(D) For each low mass emissions unit, or group of identical units for which the provisions of paragraph <PRTPAGE P="236"/>(c)(1)(iv) of this section are used to account for NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, the owner or operator shall determine a new fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate every five years (20 calendar quarters), unless changes in the fuel supply, physical changes to the unit, changes in the manner of unit operation, or changes to the emission controls occur which may cause a significant increase in the unit's actual NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate. If such changes occur, the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate(s) shall be re-determined according to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Testing shall be done at the number of loads specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) or (c)(1)(iv)(I) of this section, as applicable. If a low mass emissions unit belongs to a group of identical units and it is required to retest to determine a new fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate because of changes in the fuel supply, physical changes to the unit, changes in the manner of unit operation or changes to the emission controls occur which may cause a significant increase in the unit's actual NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, any other unit in that group of identical units is not required to re-determine the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate unless such unit also undergoes changes in the fuel supply, physical changes to the unit, changes in the manner of unit operation or changes to the emission controls occur which may cause a significant increase in the unit's actual NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates.</P>

              <P>(E) Each low mass emissions unit or each low mass emissions unit in a group of identical units for which a fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate(s) are determined shall meet the quality assurance and quality control provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

              <P>(F) Low mass emission units may use the results of appendix E testing, if such test results are available from a test conducted no more than five years prior to the time of initial certification, to determine the appropriate fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate(s). However, fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates from historical testing may not be used longer than five years after the appendix E testing was conducted.</P>

              <P>(G) Low mass emissions units for which at least 3 years of quality-assured NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data from a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS that meets the quality assurance requirements of either: this part, or appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, or a comparable State CEM program, and corresponding fuel usage data are available may determine fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates from the actual data using the following procedure. Separate the actual NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data into groups, according to the type of fuel combusted. Discard data from periods when multiple fuels were combusted. Each fuel-specific data set must contain at least 168 hours of data and must represent all normal operating ranges of the unit when combusting the fuel. Sort the data in each fuel-specific data set in ascending order according to NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate. Determine the 95th percentile NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for each data set as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter. Use the 95th percentile value for each data set as the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, except that for a unit that uses SCR or SNCR for NO<E T="52">X</E> emission control, if the 95th percentile value is less than 0.15 lb/mmBtu, a value of 0.15 lb/mmBtu shall be used as the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate.</P>
              <P>(H) For low mass emission units with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls, and for units that use dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> technology, the owner or operator shall, during every hour of unit operation during the test period, monitor and record parameters, as required under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, which indicate that the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls are operating properly. After the test period, these same parameters shall be monitored and recorded and kept for all operating hours in order to determine whether the NO<E T="52">X</E> controls are operating properly and to allow the determination of the correct NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate as required under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For low mass emission units with steam or water injection, the steam-to-fuel or water-to-fuel ratio used during the testing must be documented. The water-to-fuel or steam-to-fuel ratio must be maintained during unit operations for a unit to use the fuel and <PRTPAGE P="237"/>unit specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate determined during the test. Owners or operators must include in the monitoring plan the acceptable range of the water-to-fuel or steam-to-fuel ratio, which will be used to indicate hourly, proper operation of the NO<E T="52">X</E> controls for each unit. The water-to-fuel or steam-to-fuel ratio shall be monitored and recorded during each hour of unit operation. If the water-to-fuel or steam-to-fuel ratio is not within the acceptable range in a given hour the fuel and unit specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate may not be used for that hour, and the appropriate default NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate from Table LM-2 shall be reported instead.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For a low mass emissions unit that uses dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> premix technology to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, proper operation of the emission controls means that the unit is in the low-NO<E T="52">X</E> or premixed combustion mode, and fired with natural gas. Evidence of operation in the low-NO<E T="52">X</E> or premixed mode shall be provided by monitoring the appropriate turbine operating parameters. These parameters may include percentage of full load, turbine exhaust temperature, combustion reference temperature, compressor discharge pressure, fuel and air valve positions, dynamic pressure pulsations, internal guide vane (IGV) position, and flame detection or flame scanner condition. The acceptable values and ranges for all parameters monitored shall be specified in the monitoring plan for the unit, and the parameters shall be monitored during each subsequent operating hour. If one or more of these parameters is not within the acceptable range or at an acceptable value in a given operating hour, the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate may not be used for that hour, and the appropriate default NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate from Table LM-2 shall be reported instead. When the unit is fired with oil the appropriate default value from Table LM-2 shall be reported.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For low mass emission units with other types of add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> controls, appropriate parameters and the acceptable range of the parameters which indicate hourly proper operation of the NO<E T="52">X</E> controls must be specified in the monitoring plan. These parameters shall be monitored during each subsequent operating hour. If any of these parameters are not within the acceptable range in a given operating hour, the fuel and unit specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates may not be used in that hour, and the appropriate default NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate from Table LM-2 shall be reported instead.</P>

              <P>(I) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section, the appendix E testing to determine (or re-determine) the fuel-specific, unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for a unit (or for each unit in a group of identical units) may be performed at fewer than four loads, under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Testing may be done at one load level if the data analysis described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(J) of this section is performed and the results show that the unit has operated (or all units in the group of identical units have operated) at a single load level for at least 85.0 percent of all operating hours in the previous three years (12 calendar quarters) prior to the calendar quarter of the appendix E testing. For combustion turbines that are operated to produce approximately constant output (in MW) but which use internal operating and exhaust temperatures and not the actual output in MW to control the operation of the turbine, the internal operating temperature set point may be used as a surrogate for load in demonstrating that the unit qualifies for single-load testing. If the data analysis shows that the unit does not qualify for single-load testing, testing may be done at two (or three) load levels if the unit has operated (or if all units in the group of identical units have operated) cumulatively at two (or three) load levels for at least 85.0 percent of all operating hours in the previous three years; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If a multiple-load appendix E test was initially performed for a unit (or group of identical units) to determine the fuel-and-unit specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, then the periodic retests required under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(D) of this section may be single-load tests, performed at the load level for which the highest average NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate was obtained in the initial test.<PRTPAGE P="238"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The initial appendix E testing may be performed at a single load, between 75 and 100 percent of the maximum sustainable load defined in the monitoring plan for the unit, if the average annual capacity factor of the LME unit, when calculated according to the definition of “capacity factor” in § 72.2 of this chapter, is 2.5 percent or less for the three calendar years immediately preceding the year of the testing, and that the annual capacity factor does not exceed 4.0 percent in any of those three years. Similarly, for a LME unit that reports emissions data on an ozone season-only basis, the initial appendix E testing may be performed at a single load between 75 and 100 percent of the maximum sustainable load if the 2.5 and 4.0 percent capacity factor requirements are met for the three ozone seasons immediately preceding the date of the emission testing (see § 75.74(c)(11)). For a group of identical LME units, any unit(s) in the group that meet the 2.5 and 4.0 percent capacity factor requirements may perform the initial appendix E testing at a single load between 75 and 100 percent of the maximum sustainable load.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The retest of any LME unit may be performed at a single load between 75 and 100 percent of the maximum sustainable load if, for the three calendar years immediately preceding the year of the retest (or, if applicable, the three ozone seasons immediately preceding the date of the retest), the applicable capacity factor requirements described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(I)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section are met.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Alternatively, for combustion turbines, the single-load testing described in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(I)(<E T="03">3</E>) and (c)(1)(iv)(I)(<E T="03">4</E>) of this section may be performed at the highest attainable load level corresponding to the season of the year in which the testing is conducted.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) In all cases where the alternative single-load testing option described in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(I)(<E T="03">3</E>) through (c)(1)(iv)(I)(<E T="03">5</E>) of this section is used, the owner or operator shall keep records documenting that the required capacity factor requirements were met.</P>

              <P>(J) To determine whether a unit qualifies for testing at fewer than four loads under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(I) of this section, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(J)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (c)(1)(iv)(J)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Determine the range of operation of the unit, according to section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part. Divide the range of operation into four equal load bands. For example, if the range of operation extends from 20 MW to 100 MW, the four equal load bands would be: band #1: from 20 MW to 40 MW; band #2: from 41 MW to 60 MW; band #3: from 61 MW to 80 MW; and band #4: from 81 to 100 MW. Then, perform a historical load analysis for all unit operating hours in the 12 calendar quarters preceding the quarter of the test. Alternatively, for sources that report emissions data only during the ozone season, the historical load analysis may be based on unit operation in the previous three ozone seasons, rather than unit operation in the previous 12 calendar quarters. Determine the percentage of the data that fall into each load band. For a unit that is not part of a group of identical units, if 85.0% or more of the data fall into one load band, single-load testing may be performed at any point within that load band. For a group of identical units, if each unit in the group meets the 85.0% criterion, then representative single-load testing within the load band may be performed. If the 85.0% criterion cannot be met to qualify for single-load testing but this criterion can be met cumulatively for two (or three) load levels, then testing may be performed at two (or three) loads instead of four.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For a combustion turbine that uses exhaust temperature and not the actual output in megawatts to control the operation of the turbine (or for a group of identical units of this type), the owner or operator must document that the unit (or each unit in the group) has operated within ±10% of the set point temperature for 85.0% of the operating hours in the previous 12 calendar quarters to qualify for single-load testing. Alternatively, for sources that report emissions data only during the ozone season, the historical set point temperature analysis may be based on unit operation in the previous three ozone seasons, rather than unit <PRTPAGE P="239"/>operation in the previous 12 calendar quarters. When the set point temperature is used rather than unit load to justify single-load testing, the designated representative shall certify in the monitoring plan for the unit that this is the normal manner of unit operation and shall document the setpoint temperature.</P>

              <P>(i) For each low mass emissions unit, the owner or operator shall keep hourly records which indicate whether or not the unit operated during each clock hour of each calendar year. The owner or operator may report partial operating hours or may assume that for each hour the unit operated the operating time is a whole hour. Units using partial operating hours and the maximum rated hourly heat input to calculate heat input for each hour must report partial operating hours.</P>
              <P>(ii) For each low mass emissions unit, the owner or operator shall keep hourly records indicating the type(s) of fuel(s) combusted in the unit during each hour of unit operation.</P>
              <P>(iii) For each low mass emissions unit using the long term fuel flow methodology under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to determine hourly heat input, the owner or operator shall keep hourly records of unit load (in megawatts or thousands of pounds of steam per hour), for the purpose of apportioning heat input to the individual unit operating hours.</P>
              <P>(iv) For each low mass emissions unit with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls of any kind and each unit that uses dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> technology, the owner or operator shall keep hourly records of the hourly value of the parameter(s) specified in (c)(1)(iv)(H) of this section used to indicate proper operation of the unit's NO<E T="52">X</E> controls.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Heat input.</E> Hourly, quarterly and annual heat input for a low mass emissions unit shall be determined using either the maximum rated hourly heat input method under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section or the long term fuel flow method under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Maximum rated hourly heat input method.</E> (A) For the purposes of the mass emission calculation methodology of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, HI<E T="52">hr</E>, the hourly heat input (mmBtu) to a low mass emissions unit shall be deemed to equal the maximum rated hourly heat input, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, multiplied by the operating time of the unit for each hour. The owner or operator may choose to record and report partial operating hours or may assume that a unit operated for a whole hour for each hour the unit operated. However, the owner or operator of a unit may petition the Administrator under § 75.66 for a lower value for maximum rated hourly heat input than that defined in § 72.2 of this chapter. The Administrator may approve such lower value if the owner or operator demonstrates that either the maximum hourly heat input specified by the manufacturer or the highest observed hourly heat input, or both, are not representative, and such a lower value is representative, of the unit's current capabilities because modifications have been made to the unit, limiting its capacity permanently.</P>

              <P>(2) For low mass emissions units or groups of units which use the long term fuel flow methodology under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section and which use one of the methods specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section to determine fuel usage, the owner or operator shall keep, at the facility, a copy of the standard used and shall keep records, for three years, of all measurements obtained for each quarter using the methodology.</P>
              <P>(3) For low mass emission units or groups of units which use the long term fuel flow methodology under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section and which use a certified fuel flow meter to determine fuel usage, the owner or operator shall comply with the quality control quality assurance requirements for a fuel flow meter under section 2.1.6 of appendix D of this part.</P>

              <P>(4) For each low mass emissions unit for which fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates are determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall keep, at the facility, records which document the results of all NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate tests conducted according to appendix E to this part. If CEMS data are used to determine the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates under paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(G) of this section, the owner or operator shall keep, at the facility, records of the CEMS data and the data analysis performed to determine a fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate. The appendix E test records and historical CEMS data records shall be kept until the fuel and unit specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates are re-determined.</P>

              <P>(5) For each low mass emissions unit for which fuel-and-unit-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates are determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section and which has add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls of any kind or uses dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> technology, the owner or operator shall develop and keep on-site a quality assurance plan which explains the procedures used to document proper operation of the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls. The plan shall include the parameters monitored (e.g., water-to-fuel ratio) and the acceptable ranges for each parameter used to determine <PRTPAGE P="245"/>proper operation of the unit's NO<E T="52">X</E> controls.</P>
              <P>(6) For unmanned facilities, the records required by paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2) and (e)(4) of this section may be kept at a central location, rather than at the facility.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Initial certification and recertification procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial certification approval process.</E> The owner or operator shall ensure that each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system required by this part meets the initial certification requirements of this section and shall ensure that all applicable initial certification tests under paragraph (c) of this section are completed by the deadlines specified in § 75.4 and prior to use in the Acid Rain Program. In addition, whenever the owner or operator installs a continuous emission or opacity monitoring system in order to meet the requirements of §§ 75.11 through 75.18, where no continuous emission or opacity monitoring system was previously installed, initial certification is required.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Notification of initial certification test dates.</E> The owner or operator or designated representative shall submit a written notice of the dates of initial certification testing at the unit as specified in § 75.61(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Certification application.</E> The owner or operator shall apply for certification of each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system used under the Acid Rain Program. The owner or operator shall submit the certification application in accordance with § 75.60 and each complete certification application shall include the information specified in § 75.63.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Provisional approval of certification (or recertification) applications.</E> Upon the successful completion of the required certification (or recertification) procedures of this section, each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system <PRTPAGE P="246"/>shall be deemed provisionally certified (or recertified) for use under the Acid Rain Program for a period not to exceed 120 days following receipt by the Administrator of the complete certification (or recertification) application under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Notwithstanding this paragraph, no continuous emission or opacity monitor systems for a combustion source seeking to enter the Opt-in Program in accordance with part 74 of this chapter shall be deemed provisionally certified (or recertified) for use under the Acid Rain Program. Data measured and recorded by a provisionally certified (or recertified) continuous emission or opacity monitoring system , operated in accordance with the requirements of appendix B to this part, will be considered valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional certification or recertification), provided that the Administrator does not invalidate the provisional certification (or recertification) by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120 days of receipt by the Administrator of the complete certification (or recertification) application. Note that when the conditional data validation procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are used for the initial certification (or recertification) of a continuous emissions monitoring system, the date and time of provisional certification (or recertification) of the CEMS may be earlier than the date and time of completion of the required certification (or recertification) tests.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Certification (or recertification) application formal approval process.</E> The Administrator will issue a notice of approval or disapproval of the certification (or recertification) application to the owner or operator within 120 days of receipt of the complete certification (or recertification) application. In the event the Administrator does not issue such a notice within 120 days of receipt, each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system which meets the performance requirements of this part and is included in the certification (or recertification) application will be deemed certified (or recertified) for use under the Acid Rain Program.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Approval notice.</E> If the certification (or recertification) application is complete and shows that each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system meets the performance requirements of this part, then the Administrator will issue a notice of approval of the certification (or recertification) application within 120 days of receipt.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Incomplete application notice.</E> A certification (or recertification) application will be considered complete when all of the applicable information required to be submitted in § 75.63 has been received by the Administrator, the EPA Regional Office, and the appropriate State and/or local air pollution control agency. If the certification (or recertification) application is not complete, then the Administrator will issue a notice of incompleteness that provides a reasonable timeframe for the designated representative to submit the additional information required to complete the certification (or recertification) application. If the designated representative has not complied with the notice of incompleteness by a specified due date, then the Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval specified under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. The 120-day review period shall not begin prior to receipt of a complete application.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Disapproval notice.</E> If the certification (or recertification) application shows that any continuous emission or opacity monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of this part, or if the certification (or recertification) application is incomplete and the requirement for disapproval under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section has been met, the Administrator shall issue a written notice of disapproval of the certification (or recertification) application within 120 days of receipt. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the provisional certification (or recertification) is invalidated by the Administrator, and the data measured and recorded by each uncertified continuous emission or opacity monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data as follows: from the hour of the probationary calibration error test that began the initial certification (or recertification) test period (if the conditional data validation procedures of paragraph (b)(3) <PRTPAGE P="247"/>of this section were used to retrospectively validate data); or from the date and time of completion of the invalid certification or recertification tests (if the conditional data validation procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section were not used). The owner or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of initial certification in paragraph (a)(5) of this section for each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system which is disapproved for initial certification. For each disapproved recertification, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures of paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Audit decertification.</E> The Administrator may issue a notice of disapproval of the certification status of a continuous emission or opacity monitoring system, in accordance with § 75.21.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Procedures for loss of certification.</E> When the Administrator issues a notice of disapproval of a certification application or a notice of disapproval of certification status (as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section), then:</P>

              <P>(i) Until such time, date, and hour as the continuous emission monitoring system can be adjusted, repaired, or replaced and certification tests successfully completed (or, if the conditional data validation procedures in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this section are used, until a probationary calibration error test is passed following corrective actions in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section), the owner or operator shall substitute the following values, as applicable, for each hour of unit operation during the period of invalid data specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section or in § 75.21: the maximum potential concentration of SO<E T="52">2</E>, as defined in section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part, to report SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration; the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, to report NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions in lb/mmBtu; the maximum potential concentration of NO<E T="52">X</E>, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, to report NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions in ppm (when a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system is used to determine NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions, as defined under § 75.71(a)(2)); the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part, to report volumetric flow; the maximum potential concentration of CO<E T="52">2</E>, as defined in section 2.1.3.1 of appendix A to this part, to report CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration data; and either the minimum potential moisture percentage, as defined in section 2.1.5 of appendix A to this part or, if Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to determine NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, the maximum potential moisture percentage, as defined in section 2.1.6 of appendix A to this part; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The designated representative shall submit a notification of certification retest dates as specified in § 75.61(a)(1)(ii) and a new certification application according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator shall repeat all certification tests or other requirements that were failed by the continuous emission or opacity monitoring system, as indicated in the Administrator's notice of disapproval, no later than 30 unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of disapproval.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Recertification approval process.</E> Whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or change in a certified continuous emission monitoring system or continuous opacity monitoring system that may significantly affect the ability of the system to accurately measure or record the SO<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration, stack gas volumetric flow rate, NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, percent moisture, or opacity, or to meet the requirements of § 75.21 or appendix B to this part, the owner or operator shall recertify the continuous emission monitoring system or continuous opacity monitoring system, according to the procedures in this paragraph. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling system or the unit operation that may significantly change the flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall recertify the monitoring system according to the procedures in this paragraph. Examples of changes which <PRTPAGE P="248"/>require recertification include: replacement of the analyzer; change in location or orientation of the sampling probe or site; and complete replacement of an existing continuous emission monitoring system or continuous opacity monitoring system. The owner or operator shall also recertify the continuous emission monitoring systems for a unit that has recommenced commercial operation following a period of long-term cold storage as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter. The owner or operator shall recertify a continuous opacity monitoring system whenever the monitor path length changes or as required by an applicable State or local regulation or permit. Any change to a flow monitor or gas monitoring system for which a RATA is not necessary shall not be considered a recertification event. In addition, changing the polynomial coefficients or K factor(s) of a flow monitor shall require a 3-load RATA, but is not considered to be a recertification event; however, records of the polynomial coefficients or K factor (s) currently in use shall be maintained on-site in a format suitable for inspection. Changing the coefficient or K factor(s) of a moisture monitoring system shall require a RATA, but is not considered to be a recertification event; however, records of the coefficient or K factor (s) currently in use by the moisture monitoring system shall be maintained on-site in a format suitable for inspection. In such cases, any other tests that are necessary to ensure continued proper operation of the monitoring system (e.g., 3-load flow RATAs following changes to flow monitor polynomial coefficients, linearity checks, calibration error tests, DAHS verifications, etc.) shall be performed as diagnostic tests, rather than as recertification tests. The data validation procedures in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be applied to RATAs associated with changes to flow or moisture monitor coefficients, and to linearity checks, 7-day calibration error tests, and cycle time tests, when these are required as diagnostic tests. When the data validation procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section are applied in this manner, replace the word “recertification” with the word “diagnostic.”</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Tests required.</E> For all recertification testing, the owner or operator shall complete all initial certification tests in paragraph (c) of this section that are applicable to the monitoring system, except as otherwise approved by the Administrator. For diagnostic testing after changing the flow rate monitor polynomial coefficients, the owner or operator shall complete a 3-level RATA. For diagnostic testing after changing the K factor or mathematical algorithm of a moisture monitoring system, the owner or operator shall complete a RATA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification of recertification test dates.</E> The owner, operator, or designated representative shall submit notice of testing dates for recertification under this paragraph as specified in § 75.61(a)(1)(ii), unless all of the tests in paragraph (c) of this section are required for recertification, in which case the owner or operator shall provide notice in accordance with the notice provisions for initial certification testing in § 75.61(a)(1)(i).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Recertification test period requirements and data validation.</E> The data validation provisions in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (b)(3)(ix) of this section shall apply to all CEMS recertifications and diagnostic testing. The provisions in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this section may also be applied to initial certifications (see sections 6.2(a), 6.3.1(a), 6.3.2(a), 6.4(a) and 6.5(f) of appendix A to this part) and may be used to supplement the linearity check and RATA data validation procedures in sections 2.2.3(b) and 2.3.2(b) of appendix B to this part.</P>

              <P>(i) The owner or operator shall use substitute data, according to the standard missing data procedures in §§ 75.33 through 75.37 (or shall report emission data using a reference method or another monitoring system that has been certified or approved for use under this part), in the period extending from the hour of the replacement, modification or change made to a monitoring system that triggers the need to perform recertification testing, until either: the hour of successful completion of all of the required recertification <PRTPAGE P="249"/>tests; or the hour in which a probationary calibration error test (according to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) is performed and passed, following all necessary repairs, adjustments or reprogramming of the monitoring system. The first hour of quality-assured data for the recertified monitoring system shall either be the hour after all recertification tests have been completed or, if conditional data validation is used, the first quality-assured hour shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this section. Notwithstanding these requirements, if the replacement, modification, or change requiring recertification of the CEMS is such that the historical data stream is no longer representative (e.g., where the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration and stack flow rate change significantly after installation of a wet scrubber), the owner or operator shall substitute for missing data as follows, in lieu of using the standard missing data procedures in §§ 75.33 through 75.37: for a change that results in a significantly higher concentration or flow rate, substitute maximum potential values according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(5) of this section; or for a change that results in a significantly lower concentration or flow rate, substitute data using the standard missing data procedures. The owner or operator shall then use the initial missing data procedures in § 75.31, beginning with the first hour of quality-assured data obtained with the recertified monitoring system, unless otherwise provided by § 75.34 for units with add-on emission controls.</P>
              <P>(ii) Once the modification or change to the CEMS has been completed and all of the associated repairs, component replacements, adjustments, linearization, and reprogramming of the CEMS have been completed, a probationary calibration error test is required to establish the beginning point of the recertification test period. In this instance, the first successful calibration error test of the monitoring system following completion of all necessary repairs, component replacements, adjustments, linearization and reprogramming shall be the probationary calibration error test. The probationary calibration error test must be passed before any of the required recertification tests are commenced.</P>
              <P>(iii) Beginning with the hour of commencement of a recertification test period, emission data recorded by the CEMS are considered to be conditionally valid, contingent upon the results of the subsequent recertification tests.</P>
              <P>(iv) Each required recertification test shall be completed no later than the following number of unit operating hours (or unit operating days) after the probationary calibration error test that initiates the test period:</P>
              <P>(A) For a linearity check and/or cycle time test, 168 consecutive unit operating hours, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter or, for CEMS installed on common stacks or bypass stacks, 168 consecutive stack operating hours, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(B) For a RATA (whether normal-load or multiple-load), 720 consecutive unit operating hours, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter or, for CEMS installed on common stacks or bypass stacks, 720 consecutive stack operating hours, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(C) For a 7-day calibration error test, 21 consecutive unit operating days, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(v) All recertification tests shall be performed hands-off. No adjustments to the calibration of the CEMS, other than the routine calibration adjustments following daily calibration error tests as described in section 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part, are permitted during the recertification test period. Routine daily calibration error tests shall be performed throughout the recertification test period, in accordance with section 2.1.1 of appendix B to this part. The additional calibration error test requirements in section 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part shall also apply during the recertification test period.</P>

              <P>(vi) If all of the required recertification tests and required daily calibration error tests are successfully completed in succession with no failures, and if each recertification test is completed within the time period specified in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, then all of the conditionally valid emission data recorded <PRTPAGE P="250"/>by the CEMS shall be considered quality-assured, from the hour of commencement of the recertification test period until the hour of completion of the required test(s).</P>
              <P>(vii) If a required recertification test is failed or aborted due to a problem with the CEMS, or if a daily calibration error test is failed during a recertification test period, data validation shall be done as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) If any required recertification test is failed, it shall be repeated. If any recertification test other than a 7-day calibration error test is failed or aborted due to a problem with the CEMS, the original recertification test period is ended, and a new recertification test period must be commenced with a probationary calibration error test. The tests that are required in the new recertification test period will include any tests that were required for the initial recertification event which were not successfully completed and any recertification or diagnostic tests that are required as a result of changes made to the monitoring system to correct the problems that caused the failure of the recertification test. For a 2- or 3-load flow RATA, if the relative accuracy test is passed at one or more load levels, but is failed at a subsequent load level, provided that the problem that caused the RATA failure is corrected without re-linearizing the instrument, the length of the new recertification test period shall be equal to the number of unit operating hours remaining in the original recertification test period, as of the hour of failure of the RATA. However, if re-linearization of the flow monitor is required after a flow RATA is failed at a particular load level, then a subsequent 3-load RATA is required, and the new recertification test period shall be 720 consecutive unit (or stack) operating hours. The new recertification test sequence shall not be commenced until all necessary maintenance activities, adjustments, linearizations, and reprogramming of the CEMS have been completed;</P>
              <P>(B) If a linearity check, RATA, or cycle time test is failed or aborted due to a problem with the CEMS, all conditionally valid emission data recorded by the CEMS are invalidated, from the hour of commencement of the recertification test period to the hour in which the test is failed or aborted, except for the case in which a multiple-load flow RATA is passed at one or more load levels, failed at a subsequent load level, and the problem that caused the RATA failure is corrected without re-linearizing the instrument. In that case, data invalidation shall be prospective, from the hour of failure of the RATA until the commencement of the new recertification test period. Data from the CEMS remain invalid until the hour in which a new recertification test period is commenced, following corrective action, and a probationary calibration error test is passed, at which time the conditionally valid status of emission data from the CEMS begins again;</P>
              <P>(C) If a 7-day calibration error test is failed within the recertification test period, previously-recorded conditionally valid emission data from the CEMS are not invalidated. The conditionally valid data status is unaffected, unless the calibration error on the day of the failed 7-day calibration error test exceeds twice the performance specification in section 3 of appendix A to this part, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(D) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(D) If a daily calibration error test is failed during a recertification test period (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the results of the test exceed twice the performance specification in section 3 of appendix A to this part), the CEMS is out-of-control as of the hour in which the calibration error test is failed. Emission data from the CEMS shall be invalidated prospectively from the hour of the failed calibration error test until the hour of completion of a subsequent successful calibration error test following corrective action, at which time the conditionally valid status of data from the monitoring system resumes. Failure to perform a required daily calibration error test during a recertification test period shall also cause data from the CEMS to be invalidated prospectively, from the hour in which the calibration error test was due until the hour of completion of a subsequent successful calibration error test. Whenever a calibration error test <PRTPAGE P="251"/>is failed or missed during a recertification test period, no further recertification tests shall be performed until the required subsequent calibration error test has been passed, re-establishing the conditionally valid status of data from the monitoring system. If a calibration error test failure occurs while a linearity check or RATA is still in progress, the linearity check or RATA must be re-started.</P>
              <P>(E) Trial gas injections and trial RATA runs are permissible during the recertification test period, prior to commencing a linearity check or RATA, for the purpose of optimizing the performance of the CEMS. The results of such gas injections and trial runs shall not affect the status of previously-recorded conditionally valid data or result in termination of the recertification test period, provided that the following specifications and conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For gas injections, the stable, ending monitor response is within ±5 percent or within 5 ppm of the tag value of the reference gas;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For RATA trial runs, the average reference method reading and the average CEMS reading for the run differ by no more than ±10% of the average reference method value or ±15 ppm, or ±1.5% H<E T="52">2</E>O, or ±0.02 lb/mmBtu from the average reference method value, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) No adjustments to the calibration of the CEMS are made following the trial injection(s) or run(s), other than the adjustments permitted under section 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The CEMS is not repaired, re-linearized or reprogrammed (e.g., changing flow monitor polynomial coefficients, linearity constants, or K-factors) after the trial injection(s) or run(s).</P>

              <P>(F) If the results of any trial gas injection(s) or RATA run(s) are outside the limits in paragraphs (b)(3)(vii)(E)(<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section or if the CEMS is repaired, re-linearized or reprogrammed after the trial injection(s) or run(s), the trial injection(s) or run(s) shall be counted as a failed linearity check or RATA attempt. If this occurs, follow the procedures pertaining to failed and aborted recertification tests in paragraphs (b)(3)(vii)(A) and (b)(3)(vii)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(viii) If any required recertification test is not completed within its allotted time period, data validation shall be done as follows. For a late linearity test, RATA, or cycle time test that is passed on the first attempt, data from the monitoring system shall be invalidated from the hour of expiration of the recertification test period until the hour of completion of the late test. For a late 7-day calibration error test, whether or not it is passed on the first attempt, data from the monitoring system shall also be invalidated from the hour of expiration of the recertification test period until the hour of completion of the late test. For a late linearity test, RATA, or cycle time test that is failed on the first attempt or aborted on the first attempt due to a problem with the monitor, all conditionally valid data from the monitoring system shall be considered invalid back to the hour of the first probationary calibration error test which initiated the recertification test period. Data from the monitoring system shall remain invalid until the hour of successful completion of the late recertification test and any additional recertification or diagnostic tests that are required as a result of changes made to the monitoring system to correct problems that caused failure of the late recertification test.</P>

              <P>(ix) If any required recertification test of a monitoring system has not been completed by the end of a calendar quarter and if data contained in the quarterly report are conditionally valid pending the results of test(s) to be completed in a subsequent quarter, the owner or operator shall indicate this by means of a suitable conditionally valid data flag in the electronic quarterly report for that quarter. The owner or operator shall resubmit the report for that quarter if the required recertification test is subsequently failed. In the resubmitted report, the owner or operator shall use the appropriate missing data routine in § 75.31 or § 75.33 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data that was invalidated by the failed recertification test. Alternatively, if any required recertification <PRTPAGE P="252"/>test is not completed by the end of a particular calendar quarter but is completed no later than 30 days after the end of that quarter (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, prior to the deadline for submitting the quarterly report under § 75.64), the test data and results may be submitted with the earlier quarterly report even though the test date(s) are from the next calendar quarter. In such instances, if the recertification test(s) are passed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, conditionally valid data may be reported as quality-assured, in lieu of reporting a conditional data flag. If the recertification test(s) is failed and if conditionally valid data are replaced, as appropriate, with substitute data, then neither the reporting of a conditional data flag nor resubmission is required. In addition, if the owner or operator uses a conditionally valid data flag in any of the four quarterly reports for a given year, the owner or operator shall indicate the final status of the conditionally valid data (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, resolved or unresolved) in the annual compliance certification report required under § 72.90 of this chapter for that year. The Administrator may invalidate any conditionally valid data that remains unresolved at the end of a particular calendar year and may require the owner or operator to resubmit one or more of the quarterly reports for that calendar year, replacing the unresolved conditionally valid data with substitute data values determined in accordance with § 75.31 or § 75.33, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Recertification application.</E> The designated representative shall apply for recertification of each continuous emission or opacity monitoring system used under the Acid Rain Program. The owner or operator shall submit the recertification application in accordance with § 75.60, and each complete recertification application shall include the information specified in § 75.63.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Approval or disapproval of request for recertification.</E> The procedures for provisional certification in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall apply to recertification applications. The Administrator will issue a notice of approval, disapproval, or incompleteness according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. In the event that a recertification application is disapproved, data from the monitoring system are invalidated and the applicable missing data procedures in §§ 75.31 or 75.33 shall be used from the date and hour of receipt of the disapproval notice back to the hour of the adjustment or change to the CEMS that triggered the need for recertification testing or, if the conditional data validation procedures in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) of this section were used, back to the hour of the probationary calibration error test that began the recertification test period. Data from the monitoring system remain invalid until all required recertification tests have been passed or until a subsequent probationary calibration error test is passed, beginning a new recertification test period. The owner or operator shall repeat all recertification tests or other requirements, as indicated in the Administrator's notice of disapproval, no later than 30 unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of disapproval. The designated representative shall submit a notification of the recertification retest dates, as specified in § 75.61(a)(1)(ii), and shall submit a new recertification application according to the procedures in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial certification and recertification procedures.</E> Prior to the deadline in § 75.4, the owner or operator shall conduct initial certification tests and in accordance with § 75.63, the designated representative shall submit an application to demonstrate that the continuous emission or opacity monitoring system and components thereof meet the specifications in appendix A to this part. The owner or operator shall compare reference method values with output from the automated data acquisition and handling system that is part of the continuous emission monitoring system being tested. Except as otherwise specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (d), and (e) of this section, and in sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 of appendix A to this part, the owner or operator shall perform the following tests for initial certification or recertification of continuous emission or opacity monitoring systems or components according to the requirements of appendix A to this part:<PRTPAGE P="253"/>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Initial certification and recertification and quality assurance procedures for optional backup continuous emission monitoring systems</E>—(1) <E T="03">Redundant backups.</E> The owner or operator of an optional redundant backup CEMS shall comply with all the requirements for initial certification and recertification according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. The owner or operator shall operate the redundant backup CEMS during all periods of unit operation, except for periods of calibration, quality assurance, maintenance, or repair. The owner or operator shall perform upon the redundant backup CEMS all quality assurance and quality control procedures specified in appendix B to this part, except that the daily assessments in section 2.1 of appendix B to this part are optional for days on which the redundant backup CEMS is not used to report emission data under this part. For any day on which a redundant backup CEMS is used to report emission data, the system must meet all of the applicable daily assessment criteria in appendix B to this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-redundant backups.</E> The owner or operator of an optional non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer shall comply with all of the following requirements for initial certification, quality assurance, recertification, and data reporting:</P>

              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, for a regular non-redundant backup CEMS (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a non-redundant backup CEMS that has its own separate probe, sample interface, and analyzer), or a non-redundant backup flow monitor, all of the tests in paragraph (c) of this section are required for initial certification of the system, except for the 7-day calibration error test.</P>

              <P>(ii) For a like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzer (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a non-redundant backup analyzer that uses the same probe and sample interface as a primary monitoring system), no initial certification of the analyzer is required. A non-redundant backup analyzer, connected to the same probe and <PRTPAGE P="255"/>interface as a primary CEMS in order to satisfy the dual span requirements of section 2.1.1.4 or 2.1.2.4 of appendix A to this part, shall be treated in the same manner as a like-kind replacement analyzer.</P>

              <P>(iii) Each non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer shall comply with the daily and quarterly quality assurance and quality control requirements in appendix B to this part for each day and quarter that the non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer is used to report data, and shall meet the additional linearity and calibration error test requirements specified in this paragraph. The owner or operator shall ensure that each non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer passes a linearity check (for pollutant concentration and diluent gas monitors) or a calibration error test (for flow monitors) prior to each use for recording and reporting emissions. For a primary NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS consisting of the primary pollutant analyzer and a like-kind replacement diluent analyzer (or vice-versa), provided that the primary pollutant or diluent analyzer (as applicable) is operating and is not out-of-control with respect to any of its quality assurance requirements, only the like-kind replacement analyzer must pass a linearity check before the system is used for data reporting. When a non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer is brought into service, prior to conducting the linearity test, a probationary calibration error test (as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section), which will begin a period of conditionally valid data, may be performed in order to allow the validation of data retrospectively, as follows. Conditionally valid data from the CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer are validated back to the hour of completion of the probationary calibration error test if the following conditions are met: if no adjustments are made to the CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer other than the allowable calibration adjustments specified in section 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part between the probationary calibration error test and the successful completion of the linearity test; and if the linearity test is passed within 168 unit (or stack) operating hours of the probationary calibration error test. However, if the linearity test is performed within 168 unit or stack operating hours but is either failed or aborted due to a problem with the CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer, then all of the conditionally valid data are invalidated back to the hour of the probationary calibration error test, and data from the non-redundant backup CEMS or from the primary monitoring system of which the like-kind replacement analyzer is a part remain invalid until the hour of completion of a successful linearity test. Notwithstanding this requirement, the conditionally valid data status may be re-established after a failed or aborted linearity check, if corrective action is taken and a calibration error test is subsequently passed. However, in no case shall the use of conditional data validation extend for more than 168 unit or stack operating hours beyond the date and time of the original probationary calibration error test when the analyzer was brought into service.</P>
              <P>(iv) When data are reported from a non-redundant backup CEMS or like-kind replacement analyzer, the appropriate bias adjustment factor shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For a regular non-redundant backup CEMS, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, apply the bias adjustment factor from the most recent RATA of the non-redundant backup system (even if that RATA was done more than 12 months previously); or</P>
              <P>(B) When a like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzer is used as a component of a primary CEMS (as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section), apply the primary monitoring system bias adjustment factor.</P>
              <P>(v) For each parameter monitored (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, Hg or flow rate) at each unit or stack, a regular non-redundant backup CEMS may not be used to report data at that affected unit or common stack for more than 720 hours in any one calendar year (or 720 hours in any ozone season, for sources that report emission data only during the ozone season, in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="256"/>§ 75.74(c)), unless the CEMS passes a RATA at that unit or stack. For each parameter monitored at each unit or stack, the use of a like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzer (or analyzers) is restricted to 720 cumulative hours per calendar year (or ozone season, as applicable), unless the owner or operator redesignates the like-kind replacement analyzer(s) as component(s) of regular non-redundant backup CEMS and each redesignated CEMS passes a RATA at that unit or stack.</P>
              <P>(vi) For each regular non-redundant backup CEMS, no more than eight successive calendar quarters shall elapse following the quarter in which the last RATA of the CEMS was done at a particular unit or stack, without performing a subsequent RATA. Otherwise, the CEMS may not be used to report data from that unit or stack until the hour of completion of a passing RATA at that location.</P>

              <P>(vii) Each regular non-redundant backup CEMS shall be represented in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53 as a separate monitoring system, with unique system and component identification numbers. When like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzers are used, the owner or operator shall represent each like-kind replacement analyzer used during a particular calendar quarter in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53 as a component of a primary monitoring system. The owner or operator shall also assign a unique component identification number to each like-kind replacement analyzer, beginning with the letters “LK” (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “LK1,” “LK2,” etc.) and shall specify the manufacturer, model and serial number of the like-kind replacement analyzer. This information may be added, deleted or updated as necessary, from quarter to quarter. The owner or operator shall also report data from the like-kind replacement analyzer using the system identification number of the primary monitoring system and the assigned component identification number of the like-kind replacement analyzer. For the purposes of the electronic quarterly report required under § 75.64, the owner or operator may manually enter the appropriate component identification number(s) of any like-kind replacement analyzer(s) used for data reporting during the quarter.</P>
              <P>(viii) When reporting data from a certified regular non-redundant backup CEMS, use a method of determination (MODC) code of “02.” When reporting data from a like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzer, use a MODC of “17” (see Table 4a under § 75.57). For the purposes of the electronic quarterly report required under § 75.64, the owner or operator may manually enter the required MODC of “17” for a like-kind replacement analyzer.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reference method backups.</E> A monitoring system that is operated as a reference method backup system pursuant to the reference method requirements of methods 2, 6C, 7E, or 3A in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter need not perform and pass the certification tests required by paragraph (c) of this section prior to its use pursuant to this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification/recertification procedures for either peaking unit or by-pass stack/duct continuous emission monitoring systems.</E> The owner or operator of either a peaking unit or by-pass stack/duct continuous emission monitoring system shall comply with all the requirements for certification or recertification according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, except as follows: the owner or operator need only perform one nine-run relative accuracy test audit for certification or recertification of a flow monitor installed on the by-pass stack/duct or on the stack/duct used only by affected peaking unit(s). The relative accuracy test audit shall be performed during normal operation of the peaking unit(s) or the by-pass stack/duct.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Certification/recertification procedures for alternative monitoring systems.</E> The designated representative representing the owner or operator of each alternative monitoring system approved by the Administrator as equivalent to or better than a continuous emission monitoring system according to the criteria in subpart E of this part shall apply for certification to the Administrator prior to use of the system under the Acid Rain Program, and <PRTPAGE P="257"/>shall apply for recertification to the Administrator following a replacement, modification, or change according to the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section. The owner or operator of an alternative monitoring system shall comply with the notification and application requirements for certification or recertification according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Initial certification and recertification procedures for excepted monitoring systems under appendices D and E.</E> The owner or operator of a gas-fired unit, oil-fired unit, or diesel-fired unit using the optional protocol under appendix D or E to this part shall ensure that an excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part meets the applicable general operating requirements of § 75.10, the applicable requirements of appendices D and E to this part, and the initial certification or recertification requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Initial certification and recertification testing.</E> The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for initial certification and recertification of an excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part.</P>
              <P>(i) When the optional SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions estimation procedure in appendix D to this part or the optional NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions estimation protocol in appendix E to this part is used, the owner or operator shall provide data from a flowmeter accuracy test (or shall provide a statement of calibration if the flowmeter meets the accuracy standard by design) for each fuel flowmeter, according to section 2.1.5.1 of appendix D to this part. For orifice, nozzle, and venturi-type flowmeters, the results of primary element visual inspections and/or calibrations of the transmitters or transducers shall also be provided.</P>

              <P>(ii) For the automated data acquisition and handling system used under either the optional SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions estimation procedure in appendix D of this part or the optional NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions estimation protocol in appendix E of this part, the owner or operator shall perform tests designed to verify:</P>
              <P>(A) The proper computation of hourly averages for pollutant concentrations, fuel flow rates, emission rates, heat input, and pollutant mass emissions; and</P>
              <P>(B) Proper computation and application of the missing data substitution procedures in appendix D or E of this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) When the optional NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions protocol in appendix E is used, the owner or operator shall complete all initial performance testing under section 2.1 of appendix E.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Initial certification, recertification, and QA testing notification.</E> The designated representative shall provide initial certification testing notification, recertification testing notification, and routine periodic quality-assurance testing, as specified in § 75.61. Initial certification testing notification, recertification testing notification, or periodic quality assurance testing notification is not required for an excepted monitoring system under appendix D to this part.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Monitoring plan.</E> The designated representative shall submit an initial monitoring plan in accordance with § 75.62(a).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Initial certification or recertification application.</E> The designated representative shall submit an initial certification or recertification application in accordance with §§ 75.60 and 75.63.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Provisional approval of initial certification and recertification applications.</E> Upon the successful completion of the required initial certification or recertification procedures for each excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part, each excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part shall be deemed provisionally certified (or recertified) for use under the Acid Rain Program during the period for the Administrator's review. The provisions for the initial certification or recertification application formal approval process in paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall apply, except that the term “excepted monitoring system” shall apply rather than “continuous emission or opacity monitoring system” and except that the procedures for loss of certification or for disapproval of a recertification request in paragraph (g)(7) of this section shall apply rather than the procedures for loss of certification or denial of a recertification request in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="258"/>(a)(5) or (b)(5) of this section. Data measured and recorded by a provisionally certified (or recertified) excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part will be considered quality-assured data from the date and time of completion of the last initial certification or recertification test, provided that the Administrator does not revoke the provisional certification or recertification by issuing a notice of disapproval in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a)(4) or (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Recertification requirements.</E> Recertification of an excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part is required for any modification to the system or change in operation that could significantly affect the ability of the system to accurately account for emissions and for which the Administrator determines that an accuracy test of the fuel flowmeter or a retest under appendix E to this part to re-establish the NO<E T="52">X</E> correlation curve is required. Examples of such changes or modifications include fuel flowmeter replacement, changes in unit configuration, or exceedance of operating parameters.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Procedures for loss of certification or recertification for excepted monitoring systems under appendices D and E to this part.</E> In the event that a certification or recertification application is disapproved for an excepted monitoring system, data from the monitoring system are invalidated, and the applicable missing data procedures in section 2.4 of appendix D or section 2.5 of appendix E to this part shall be used from the date and hour of receipt of such notice back to the hour of the provisional certification. Data from the excepted monitoring system remain invalid until all required tests are repeated and the excepted monitoring system is again provisionally certified. The owner or operator shall repeat all certification or recertification tests or other requirements, as indicated in the Administrator's notice of disapproval, no later than 30 unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of disapproval. The designated representative shall submit a notification of the certification or recertification retest dates if required under paragraph (g)(2) of this section and shall submit a new certification or recertification application according to the procedures in paragraph (g)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Initial certification and recertification procedures for low mass emission units using the excepted methodologies under § 75.19.</E> The owner or operator of a gas-fired or oil-fired unit using the low mass emissions excepted methodology under § 75.19 shall meet the applicable general operating requirements of § 75.10, the applicable requirements of § 75.19, and the applicable certification requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Monitoring plan.</E> The designated representative shall submit a monitoring plan in accordance with §§ 75.53 and 75.62.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Certification application.</E> The designated representative shall submit a certification application in accordance with § 75.63(a)(1)(ii).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Approval of certification applications.</E> The provisions for the certification application formal approval process in the introductory text of paragraph (a)(4) and in paragraphs (a)(4)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section shall apply, except that “continuous emission or opacity monitoring system” shall be replaced with “low mass emissions excepted methodology.” Provisional certification status for the low mass emissions methodology begins on the date of submittal (consistent with the definition of “submit” in § 72.2 of this chapter) of a complete certification application, and the methodology is considered to be certified either upon receipt of a written approval notice from the Administrator or, if such notice is not provided, at the end of the Administrator's 120-day review period. However, in contrast to CEM systems or appendix D and E monitoring systems, a provisionally certified or certified low mass emissions excepted methodology may not be used to report data under the Acid Rain Program or in a NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions reduction program under subpart H of this part prior to the applicable commencement date specified in § 75.19(a)(2)(i).<PRTPAGE P="259"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Disapproval of low mass emissions unit certification applications.</E> If the Administrator determines that the certification application for a low mass emissions unit does not demonstrate that the unit meets the requirements of §§ 75.19(a) and (b), the Administrator shall issue a written notice of disapproval of the certification application within 120 days of receipt. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated by the Administrator, and any emission data reported using the excepted methodology during the Administrator's 120-day review period shall be considered invalid. The owner or operator shall use the following procedures when a certification application is disapproved:</P>

              <P>(i) The owner or operator shall substitute the following values, as applicable, for each hour of unit operation in which data were reported using the low mass emissions methodology until such time, date, and hour as continuous emission monitoring systems or excepted monitoring systems, where applicable, are installed and provisionally certified: the maximum potential concentration of SO<E T="52">2</E>, as defined in section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part; the maximum potential fuel flowrate, as defined in section 2.4.2 of appendix D to this part; the maximum potential values of fuel sulfur content, GCV, and density (if applicable) in Table D-6 of appendix D to this part; the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter; the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part; or the maximum potential CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration as defined in section 2.1.3.1 of appendix A to this part. For a unit subject to a State or federal NO<E T="52">X</E> mass reduction program where the owner or operator intends to monitor NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions with a NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitor and a flow monitoring system, substitute for NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration using the maximum potential concentration of NO<E T="52">X</E>, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, and substitute for volumetric flow using the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The designated representative shall submit a notification of certification test dates for the required monitoring systems, as specified in § 75.61(a)(1)(i), and shall submit a certification application according to the procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Recertification.</E> Recertification of an approved low mass emissions excepted methodology is not required. Once the Administrator has approved the methodology for use, the owner or operator is subject to the on-going qualification and disqualification procedures in § 75.19(b), on an annual or ozone season basis, as applicable.</P>

              <P>(2) The owner or operator shall ensure that each non-redundant backup CEMS meets the quality assurance requirements of § 75.20(d) for each day and quarter that the system is used to report data.</P>

              <P>(3) The owner or operator shall perform quality assurance upon a reference method backup monitoring system according to the requirements of Method 2, 6C, 7E, or 3A in Appendices A-1, A-2 and A-4 to part 60 of this chapter (supplemented, as necessary, by guidance from the Administrator), instead of the procedures specified in appendix B to this part.<PRTPAGE P="260"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator of a unit with an SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system is not required to perform the daily or quarterly assessments of the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system under appendix B to this part on any day or in any calendar quarter in which only gaseous fuel is combusted in the unit if, during those days and calendar quarters, SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions are determined in accordance with § 75.11(e)(1). However, such assessments are permissible, and if any daily calibration error test or linearity test of the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system is failed while the unit is combusting only gaseous fuel, the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system shall be considered out-of-control. The length of the out-of-control period shall be determined in accordance with the applicable procedures in section 2.1.4 or 2.2.3 of appendix B to this part.</P>
              <P>(5) For a unit with an SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous monitoring system, in which gaseous fuel that is very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) is sometimes burned as a primary or backup fuel and in which higher-sulfur fuel(s) such as oil or coal are, at other times, burned as primary or backup fuel(s), the owner shall perform the relative accuracy test audits of the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system (as required by section 6.5 of appendix A to this part and section 2.3.1 of appendix B to this part) only when the higher-sulfur fuel is combusted in the unit and shall not perform SO<E T="52">2</E> relative accuracy test audits when the very low sulfur gaseous fuel is the only fuel being combusted.</P>

              <P>(6) If the designated representative certifies that a unit with an SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system burns only very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system is exempted from the relative accuracy test audit requirements in appendices A and B to this part.</P>

              <P>(7) If the designated representative certifies that a particular unit with an SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system combusts primarily fuel(s) that are very low sulfur fuel(s) (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) and combusts higher sulfur fuel(s) only for infrequent, non-routine operations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> only as emergency backup fuel(s) or for short-term testing), the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system shall be exempted from the RATA requirements of appendices A and B to this part in any calendar year that the unit combusts the higher sulfur fuel(s) for no more than 480 hours. If, in a particular calendar year, the higher-sulfur fuel usage exceeds 480 hours, the owner or operator shall perform a RATA of the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor (while combusting the higher-sulfur fuel) either by the end of the calendar quarter in which the exceedance occurs or by the end of a 720 unit (or stack) operating hour grace period (under section 2.3.3 of appendix B to this part) following the quarter in which the exceedance occurs.</P>

              <P>(8) The quality assurance provisions of §§ 75.11(e)(3)(i) through 75.11(e)(3)(iv) shall apply to all units with SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring systems during hours in which only very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) is combusted in the unit.</P>
              <P>(9) Provided that a unit with an SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system is not exempted from the SO<E T="52">2</E> RATA requirements of this part under paragraphs (a)(6) or (a)(7) of this section, any calendar quarter during which a unit combusts only very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) shall be excluded in determining the quarter in which the next relative accuracy test audit must be performed for the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system. However, no more than eight successive calendar quarters shall elapse after a relative accuracy test audit of an SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system, without a subsequent relative accuracy test audit having been performed. The owner or operator shall ensure that a relative accuracy test audit is performed, in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, either by the end of the eighth successive elapsed calendar quarter since the last RATA or by the end of a 720 unit (or stack) operating hour grace period, as provided in section 2.3.3 of appendix B to this part.</P>

              <P>(10) The owner or operator who, in accordance with § 75.11(e)(1), uses a certified flow monitor and a certified diluent monitor and Equation F-23 in appendix F to this part to calculate SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions during hours in which a unit combusts only natural gas or pipeline natural gas (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) shall meet all quality control and quality assurance requirements in <PRTPAGE P="261"/>appendix B to this part for the flow monitor and the diluent monitor.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consequences of audits.</E> The owner or operator shall invalidate data from a continuous emission monitoring system or continuous opacity monitoring system upon failure of an audit under appendix B to this part or any other audit, beginning with the unit operating hour of completion of a failed audit as determined by the Administrator. The owner or operator shall not use invalidated data for reporting either emissions or heat input, nor for calculating monitor data availability.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Audit decertification.</E> Whenever both an audit of a continuous emission or opacity monitoring system (or component thereof, including the data acquisition and handling system), of any excepted monitoring system under appendix D or E to this part, or of any alternative monitoring system under subpart E of this part, and a review of the initial certification application or of a recertification application, reveal that any system or component should not have been certified or recertified because it did not meet a particular performance specification or other requirement of this part, both at the time of the initial certification or recertification application submission and at the time of the audit, the Administrator will issue a notice of disapproval of the certification status of such system or component. For the purposes of this paragraph, an audit shall be either a field audit of the facility or an audit of any information submitted to EPA or the State agency regarding the facility. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the certification status is revoked prospectively by the Administrator. The data measured and recorded by each system shall not be considered valid quality-assured data from the date of issuance of the notification of the revoked certification status until the date and time that the owner or operator completes subsequently approved initial certification or recertification tests. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures in § 75.20(a)(5) for initial certification or § 75.20(b)(5) for recertification to replace, prospectively, all of the invalid, non-quality-assured data for each disapproved system.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Out-of-control period.</E> Whenever a continuous emission monitoring system or continuous opacity monitoring system fails a quality assurance audit or any other audit, the system is out-of-control. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures for out-of-control periods in § 75.24.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Requirements for Air Emission Testing.</E> On and after March 27, 2012, relative accuracy testing under § 75.74(c)(2)(ii), section 6.5 of appendix A to this part, and section 2.3.1 of appendix B to this part, and stack testing under § 75.19 and section 2.1 of appendix E to this part shall be performed by an “Air Emission Testing Body”, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter. Conformance to the requirements of ASTM D7036-04 (incorporated by reference, see § 75.6), referred to in section 6.1.2 of appendix A to this part, shall apply only to these tests. Section 1.1.4 of appendix B to this part, and section 2.1 of appendix E to this part require compliance with section 6.1.2 of appendix A to this part. Tests and activities under this part not required to be performed by an AETB as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter include daily CEMS operation, daily calibration error checks, daily flow interference checks, quarterly linearity checks, routine maintenance of CEMS, voluntary emissions testing, or emissions testing required under other regulations.</P>

              <P>(b) However, the owner or operator shall have no need to provide substitute data according to the missing data procedures in this subpart if the owner or operator uses SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, or O<E T="52">2</E> concentration, flow rate, percent moisture, or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data recorded from either a certified redundant or regular non-redundant backup CEMS, a like-kind replacement non-redundant backup analyzer, or a backup reference method monitoring system when the certified primary monitor is not operating or is out-of-control. A redundant or non-redundant backup continuous emission monitoring system must have been certified according to the procedures in § 75.20 prior to the missing data period. Non-redundant backup continuous emission monitoring system must pass a linearity check (for pollutant concentration monitors) or a calibration error test (for flow monitors) prior to each period of use of the certified backup monitor <PRTPAGE P="268"/>for recording and reporting emissions. Use of a certified backup monitoring system or backup reference method monitoring system is optional and at the discretion of the owner or operator.</P>
              <P>(c) When the certified primary monitor is not operating or out-of-control, then data recorded for an affected unit from a certified backup continuous emission monitor or backup reference method monitoring system are used, as if such data were from the certified primary monitor, to calculate monitor data availability in § 75.32, and to provide the quality-assured data used in the missing data procedures in §§ 75.31 and 75.33, such as the “hour after” value.</P>

Similarly, following initial certification of the required NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, or flow monitoring system(s) at a unit or stack location, the owner or operator shall begin calculating the percent monitor data availability as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and shall, upon completion of the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours, record, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, the percent monitor data availability for each monitored parameter. Notwithstanding these requirements, if three years (26,280 clock hours) have elapsed since the date and hour of initial certification and fewer than 720 (or 2,160, as applicable) quality-assured monitor operating hours have been recorded, the owner or operator shall begin recording the percent monitor data availability. The percent monitor data availability shall be calculated for each monitored parameter at each unit or stack location, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Prior to completion of 8,760 unit or stack operating hours following initial certification, the owner or operator shall, for the purpose of applying the standard missing data procedures of § 75.33, use Equation 8 to calculate, hourly, percent monitor data availability.</P>

Notwithstanding this requirement, if three years (26,280 clock hours) have elapsed since initial certification and fewer than 8,760 unit or stack operating hours have been accumulated, the owner or operator shall begin using a modified version of Equation 9, as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

No hours from more than three years (26,280 clock hours) earlier shall be used in Equation 9. For a unit that has accumulated fewer than 8,760 unit operating hours in the previous three years (26,280 clock hours), replace the words “during previous 8,760 unit operating hours” in the numerator of Equation 9 with “in the previous three years” and replace “8,760” in the denominator of Equation 9 with “total unit operating hours in the previous three years.” The owner or operator of a unit with an SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system shall, when SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions are determined in accordance with § 75.11(e)(1) or (e)(2), exclude hours in which a unit combusts only gaseous fuel from calculations of percent monitor data availability for SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitors, as provided in § 75.30(d).</P>

              <P>(i) For a missing data period of less than or equal to 8 hours, substitute the average of the hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations recorded by an SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.</P>
              <P>(ii) For a missing data period of more than 8 hours, substitute the greater of:</P>
              <P>(A) the 95th percentile hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration recorded by an SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor during the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours; or</P>
              <P>(B) The average of the hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations recorded by an SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor for the hour before and the hour after the missing data period.</P>

              <P>(3) If the monitor data availability is at least 80.0 percent but less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall substitute for that hour of the missing data period the maximum hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration recorded by an SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor during the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours.</P>

              <P>(5) For units that combust more than one type of fuel, the owner or operator may opt to implement the missing data routines in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section on a fuel-specific basis. If this option is selected, the owner or operator shall document this in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53.</P>
              <P>(6) Use the following guidelines to implement paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section on a fuel-specific basis:</P>
              <P>(i) Separate the historical, quality-assured SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration data according to the type of fuel combusted;<PRTPAGE P="273"/>
              </P>

              <P>(ii) For units that co-fire different types of fuel, either group the co-fired hours with the historical data for the fuel with the highest SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate (e.g., if diesel oil and pipeline natural gas are co-fired, count co-fired hours as oil-burning hours), or separate the co-fired hours from the single-fuel hours;</P>

              <P>(iii) For the purposes of providing substitute data under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, determine a separate, fuel-specific maximum potential SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration (MPC) value for each type of fuel combusted in the unit, in a manner consistent with section 2.1.1.1 of appendix A to this part. For fuel that qualifies as pipeline natural gas or natural gas (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), the owner or operator shall, for the purposes of determining the MPC, either determine the maximum total sulfur content and minimum gross calorific value (GCV) of the gas by fuel sampling and analysis or shall use a default total sulfur content of 0.05 percent by weight (dry basis) and a default GCV value of 950 Btu/scf. For co-firing, the MPC value shall be based on the fuel with the highest SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate. The exact methodology used to determine each fuel-specific MPC value shall be documented in the monitoring plan for the unit or stack; and</P>

              <P>(iv) For missing data periods that require 720-hour (or, if applicable, 3-year) lookbacks, use historical data for the type of fuel combusted during each hour of the missing data period to determine the appropriate substitute data value for that hour. For co-fired missing data hours, if the historical data are separated into single-fuel and co-fired hours, use co-fired data to provide the substitute data values. Otherwise, use data for the fuel with the highest SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate to provide substitute data values for co-fired missing data hours.</P>
              <P>(7) Table 1 summarizes the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) If the monitor data availability is at least 80.0 percent but less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system, substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum hourly flow rate or the maximum hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate or the maximum hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration recorded during the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin, as determined using the procedure in appendix C to this part.</P>

              <P>(4) If the monitor data availability is less than 80.0 percent, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for that hour of the missing data period, the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part, or the maximum NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, or the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part. In addition, when non-load-based operational bins are used, the owner or operator shall substitute the maximum potential flow rate for any hour in the missing data period in which essential operating or parametric data are unavailable and the operational bin cannot be determined.</P>

              <P>(5) This paragraph, (c)(5), does not apply to non-load-based, affected units using operational bins. Whenever no prior quality-assured flow rate data, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration data or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data exist for the corresponding load range, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, for each hour of missing data, the maximum hourly flow rate or the maximum hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration or maximum hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate at the next higher level load range for which quality-assured data are available.</P>

              <P>(6) Whenever no prior quality-assured flow rate data, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration data or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data exist at either the corresponding load range (or a higher load range) or at the corresponding operational bin, the owner or operator shall substitute, as applicable, either the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate or the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part or the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(7) This paragraph (c)(7) does not apply to affected units using non-load-based operational bins. For units that combust more than one type of fuel, the owner or operator may opt to implement the missing data routines in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section on a fuel-specific basis. If this option is selected, the owner or operator shall document this in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53.</P>
              <P>(8) This paragraph, (c)(8), does not apply to affected units using non-load-based operational bins. Use the following guidelines to implement paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section on a fuel-specific basis:</P>
              <P>(i) Separate the historical, quality-assured NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, or flow rate data according to the type of fuel combusted;</P>

              <P>(ii) For units that co-fire different types of fuel, either group the co-fired hours with the historical data for the fuel with the highest NO<E T="52">X</E> emission <PRTPAGE P="275"/>rate, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration or flow rate, or separate the co-fired hours from the single-fuel hours;</P>

              <P>(iii) For the purposes of providing substitute data under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a separate, fuel-specific maximum potential concentration (MPC), maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MER), or maximum potential flow rate (MPF) value (as applicable) shall be determined for each type of fuel combusted in the unit, in a manner consistent with § 72.2 of this chapter and with section 2.1.2.1 or 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to this part. For co-firing, the MPC, MER or MPF value shall be based on the fuel with the highest emission rate or flow rate (as applicable). Furthermore, for a unit with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls, a separate fuel-specific maximum controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MCR) or maximum expected NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration (MEC) value (as applicable) shall be determined for each type of fuel combusted in the unit. The exact methodology used to determine each fuel-specific MPC, MER, MEC, MCR or MPF value shall be documented in the monitoring plan for the unit or stack.</P>

              <P>(iv) For missing data periods that require 2,160-hour (or, if applicable, 3-year) lookbacks, use historical data for the type of fuel combusted during each hour of the missing data period to determine the appropriate substitute data value for that hour. For co-fired missing data hours, if the historical data are separated into single-fuel and co-fired hours, use co-fired data to provide the substitute data values. Otherwise, use data for the fuel with the highest NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration or flow rate (as applicable) to provide substitute data values for co-fired missing data hours.

              <SUBJECT>Units with add-on emission controls.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The owner or operator of an affected unit equipped with add-on SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls shall provide substitute data in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1), through (a)(5) of this section for each hour in which quality-assured data from the outlet SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NO<E T="52">X</E> monitoring system(s) are not obtained.</P>

              <P>(1) The owner or operator may use the missing data substitution procedures specified in §§ 75.31 through 75.33 <PRTPAGE P="279"/>to provide substitute data for any missing data hour(s) in which the add-on emission controls are documented to be operating properly, as described in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit, required by section 1 in appendix B of this part. To provide the necessary documentation, the owner or operator shall, for each missing data period, record parametric data to verify the proper operation of the SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission controls during each hour, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. For any missing data hour(s) in which such parametric data are either not provided or, if provided, do not demonstrate that proper operation of the SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission controls has been maintained, the owner or operator shall substitute (as applicable) the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration (MPC) as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, or the maximum potential concentration for SO<E T="52">2</E>, as defined by section 2.1.1.1. Alternatively, for SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E>, the owner or operator may substitute, if available, the hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration recorded by a certified inlet monitor, in lieu of the MPC. For each hour in which data from an inlet monitor are reported, the owner or operator shall use a method of determination code (MODC) of “22” (see Table 4a in § 75.57). In addition, under § 75.64(c), the designated representative shall submit as part of each electronic quarterly report, a certification statement, verifying the proper operation of the SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission control for each missing data period in which the missing data procedures of §§ 75.31 through 75.33 were applied; or</P>

              <P>(2) This paragraph, (a)(2), applies only to a unit which, as provided in § 75.74(a) or § 75.74(b)(1), reports NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions on a year-round basis under a state or Federal NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions reduction program that adopts the emissions monitoring provisions of this part. If the add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls installed on such a unit are operated only during the ozone season or are operated in a more efficient manner during the ozone season than outside the ozone season, the owner or operator may implement the missing data provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the following alternative manner:</P>
              <P>(i) The historical, quality-assured NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate or NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration data may be separated into two categories, i.e., data recorded inside the ozone season and data recorded outside the ozone season;</P>
              <P>(ii) For the purposes of the missing data lookback periods described under §§ 75.33 (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(5) of this section, the substitute data values shall be taken from the appropriate database, depending on the date(s) and hour(s) of the missing data period. That is, if the missing data period occurs inside the ozone season, the ozone season data shall be used to provide substitute data. If the missing data period occurs outside the ozone season, data from outside the ozone season shall be used to provide substitute data.</P>
              <P>(iii) A missing data period that begins outside the ozone season and continues into the ozone season shall be considered to be two separate missing data periods, one ending on April 30, hour 23, and the other beginning on May 1, hour 00;</P>
              <P>(iv) For missing data hours outside the ozone season, the procedures of § 75.33 may be applied unconditionally, i.e., documentation of the operational status of the emission controls is not required in order to apply the standard missing data routines.</P>

              <P>(3) For each missing data hour in which the percent monitor data availability for SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E>, calculated in accordance with § 75.32, is less than 90.0 percent and is greater than or equal to 80.0 percent; and parametric data establishes that the add-on emission controls were operating properly (<E T="03">i.e.</E> within the range of operating parameters provided in the quality assurance/quality control program) during the hour, the owner or operator may:</P>
              <P>(i) Replace the maximum SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration recorded in the 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours immediately preceding the missing data period, with the maximum controlled SO2 concentration recorded in the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours; or<PRTPAGE P="280"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Replace the maximum NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration(s) or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate(s) from the appropriate load bin(s) (based on a lookback through the 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours immediately preceding the missing data period), with the maximum controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration(s) or emission rate(s) from the appropriate load bin(s) in the same 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hour lookback period.</P>

              <P>(4) The designated representative may petition the Administrator under § 75.66 for approval of site-specific parametric monitoring procedure(s) for calculating substitute data for missing SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration, NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration, and NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and appendix C to this part. The owner or operator shall record the data required in appendix C to this part, pursuant to § 75.58(b).</P>

              <P>(5) For each missing data hour in which the percent monitor data availability for SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E>, calculated in accordance with § 75.32, is below 80.0 percent and parametric data establish that the add-on emission controls were operating properly (<E T="03">i.e.</E> within the range of operating parameters provided in the quality assurance/quality control program),in lieu of reporting the maximum potential value, the owner or operator may substitute, as applicable, the greater of:</P>
              <P>(i) The maximum expected SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration or 1.25 times the maximum hourly controlled SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration recorded in the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours;</P>
              <P>(ii) The maximum expected NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration or 1.25 times the maximum hourly controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration recorded in the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin;</P>
              <P>(iii) The maximum controlled hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MCR) or 1.25 times the maximum hourly controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate recorded in the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin;</P>

              <P>(iv) For the purposes of implementing the missing data options in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of this section, the maximum expected SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations shall be determined, respectively, according to sections 2.1.1.2 and 2.1.2.2 of appendix A to this part. The MCR shall be calculated according to the basic procedure described in section 2.1.2.1(b) of appendix A to this part, except that the words “maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MER)” shall be replaced with the words “maximum controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MCR)” and the NO<E T="52">X</E> MEC shall be used instead of the NO<E T="52">X</E> MPC.</P>
              <P>(b) For an affected unit equipped with add-on SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, the designated representative may petition the Administrator to approve a parametric monitoring procedure, as described in appendix C of this part, for calculating substitute SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration data for missing data periods. The owner or operator shall use the procedures in §§ 75.31, 75.33, or 75.34(a) for providing substitute data for missing SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration data unless a parametric monitoring procedure has been approved by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(1) Where the monitor data availability is 90.0 percent or more for an outlet SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor, the owner or operator may calculate substitute data using an approved parametric monitoring procedure.</P>

              <P>(2) Where the monitor data availability for an outlet SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor is less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data using the procedures in § 75.34(a) (1) or (2), even if the Administrator has approved a parametric monitoring procedure.</P>
              <P>(c) For an affected unit with NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission controls, the designated representative may petition the Administrator to approve a parametric monitoring procedure, as described in appendix C of this part, in order to calculate substitute NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data for missing data periods. The owner or operator shall use the procedures in § 75.31 or 75.33 for providing substitute data for missing NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data prior to receiving the Administrator's approval for a parametric monitoring procedure.<PRTPAGE P="281"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Where monitor data availability for a NO<E T="52">X</E> continuous emission monitoring system is 90.0 percent or more, the owner or operator may calculate substitute data using an approved parametric monitoring procedure.</P>
              <P>(2) Where monitor data availability for a NO<E T="52">X</E> continuous emission monitoring system is less than 90.0 percent, the owner or operator shall calculate substitute data using the procedure in § 75.34(a) (1) or (2), even if the Administrator has approved a parametric monitoring procedure.</P>

              <P>(d) In order to implement the options in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3) and (a)(5) of this section; and §§ 75.31(c)(3) and 75.72(c)(3), the owner or operator shall keep records of information as described in § 75.58(b)(3) to verify the proper operation of all add-on SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls, during all periods of SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission missing data. If the owner or operator elects to implement the missing data option in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the records in § 75.58(b)(3) are required to be kept only for the ozone season. The owner or operator shall document in the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program required by section 1 of appendix B to this part, the parameters monitored and (as applicable) the ranges and combinations of parameters that indicate proper operation of the controls. The owner or operator shall provide the information recorded under § 75.58(b)(3) and the related QA/QC program information to the Administrator, to the EPA Regional Office, or to the appropriate State or local agency, upon request.</P>

The permitting authority and the Administrator may approve such a method whenever the designated representative demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the permitting authority and the Administrator, that the method ensures that the NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions from the affected units are not underestimated. In addition, the owner or operator shall also either:</P>
              <P>(A) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a flow monitoring system in the duct from each nonaffected unit or,</P>

              <P>(B) For any nonaffected unit exhausting to the common stack and otherwise eligible to use the procedures in appendix D to this part, determine heat input rate using the procedures in appendix D for that unit.

For any remaining nonaffected unit that exhausts to the common stack, install, certify, operate, and maintain a flow monitoring system in the duct to the common stack; or</P>

              <P>(iii) Install a flow monitoring system in the common stack and record the combined emissions from all units as the combined NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions for the affected units for recordkeeping and compliance purposes, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>

              <P>(iv) Submit a petition to the permitting authority and the Administrator to allow use of a method for apportioning NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions measured in the common stack to each of the units using the common stack and for reporting the NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions. The permitting authority and the Administrator may approve such a method whenever the designated representative demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the permitting authority and the Administrator, that the method ensures that the NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions from the affected units are not underestimated.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Unit with a main stack and a bypass stack.</E> Whenever any portion of the flue gases from an affected unit can be routed through a bypass stack to avoid the installed NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emissions monitoring system or NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system, the owner and operator shall either:</P>

              <P>(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain separate NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emissions monitoring systems and flow monitoring systems on the main stack and the bypass stack and calculate NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions for the unit as the sum of the NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions measured at the two stacks;</P>
              <P>(2) Monitor NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions at the main stack using a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS and a flow monitoring system and measure NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions at the bypass stack using the reference methods in § 75.22(b) for NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, flow rate, and diluent gas concentration, or NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration and flow rate, and calculate NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions for the unit as the sum of the emissions recorded by the installed monitoring systems on the main stack and the emissions measured by the reference method monitoring systems; or</P>
              <P>(3) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS and a flow monitoring system only on the main stack. If this option is chosen, it is not necessary to designate the exhaust configuration as a multiple stack configuration in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53, since only the main stack is monitored. For each unit operating hour in which the bypass stack is used and the emissions are either uncontrolled (or the add-on controls are not documented to be operating properly), report NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions as follows. If the unit heat input is determined using a flow monitor and a diluent monitor, report NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions using the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, the maximum potential flow rate, and either the maximum potential CO<E T="52">2</E> concentration or the minimum potential O<E T="52">2</E> concentration (as applicable). The maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate may be specific to the type of fuel combusted in the unit during the bypass <PRTPAGE P="342"/>(see § 75.33(c)(8)). If the unit heat input is determined using a fuel flowmeter, in accordance with appendix D to this part, report NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions as the product of the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate and the actual measured hourly heat input rate. Alternatively, for a unit with NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission controls, for each unit operating hour in which the bypass stack is used but the add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls are not bypassed, the owner or operator may report the maximum controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MCR) instead of the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate provided that the add-on controls are documented to be operating properly, as described in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit, required by section 1 in appendix B of this part. To provide the necessary documentation, the owner or operator shall record parametric data to verify the proper operation of the NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission controls as described in § 75.34(d). Furthermore, the owner or operator shall calculate the MCR using the procedure described in section 2.1.2.1(b) of appendix A to this part by replacing the words “maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MER)” with the words “maximum controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MCR)” and by using the NO<E T="52">X</E> MEC in the calculations instead of the NO<E T="52">X</E> MPC.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unit with multiple stack or duct configuration.</E> When the flue gases from an affected unit discharge to the atmosphere through more than one stack, or when the flue gases from an affected unit utilize two or more ducts feeding into a single stack and the owner or operator chooses to monitor in the ducts rather than in the stack, the owner or operator shall either:</P>
              <P>(1) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system and a flow monitoring system in each of the multiple stacks and determine NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions from the affected unit as the sum of the NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions recorded for each stack. If another unit also exhausts flue gases into one of the monitored stacks, the owner or operator shall comply with the applicable requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in order to properly determine the NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions from the units using that stack;</P>
              <P>(2) Install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emissions monitoring system and a flow monitoring system in each of the ducts that feed into the stack, and determine NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions from the affected unit using the sum of the NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions measured at each duct; or</P>

              <P>(3) If the unit is eligible to use the procedures in appendix D to this part and if the conditions and restrictions of § 75.17(c)(2) are fully met, install, certify, operate, and maintain a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emissions monitoring system in one of the ducts feeding into the stack or in one of the multiple stacks, (as applicable) in accordance with § 75.17(c)(2), and use the procedures in appendix D to this part to determine heat input rate for the unit.</P>

However, this option may not be used for the case described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. When using this approach, calculate NO<E T="52">X</E> mass according to sections 8.2 and 8.3 in appendix F to this part. In addition, if an applicable State or federal NO<E T="52">X</E> mass reduction program requires determination of a unit's heat input, the owner or operator must either:</P>

For all other flow rate monitoring systems, a 2-load (or 2-level) RATA is required at the two most frequently-used load or operating levels (as defined under section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part), with the following exceptions. Except for flow monitors exempted from 3-level RATA testing under section 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part, a 3-load flow RATA is required at least once every five years and is also required if the flow monitor polynomial coefficients or K factor(s) are changed prior to conducting the flow RATA required under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(D) A bias test of each required NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system, each NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring system and each flow rate monitoring system shall be performed in accordance with section 7.6 of appendix A to this part. If the bias test is failed, a bias adjustment factor (BAF) shall be calculated for the monitoring system, as described in section 7.6.5 of appendix A to this part and shall be applied to the subsequent data recorded by the CEMS.</P>
              <P>(E) In the time period extending from the hour of completion of the required RATA through April 30, the owner or operator shall operate and maintain the CEMS by performing, at a minimum, the following activities:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The owner or operator shall perform daily calibration error tests and (if applicable) daily flow monitor interference checks, according to section 2.1 of appendix B to this part. When a <PRTPAGE P="349"/>daily calibration error test or interference check is failed, as described in section 2.1.4 of appendix B to this part, corrective actions shall be taken. The additional calibration error test provisions in section 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part shall be followed. Records of the required daily calibration error tests and interference checks shall be kept in a format suitable for inspection on a year-round basis.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or change in a certified monitoring system that significantly affects the ability of the system to accurately measure or record NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions or heat input or to meet the requirements of § 75.21 or appendix B to this part, the owner or operator shall recertify the monitoring system according to § 75.20(b).</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Data validation.</E> For each RATA that is performed by April 30, data validation shall be done according to sections 2.3.2(a)-(j) of appendix B to this part. However, if a required RATA is not completed by April 30, data from the monitoring system shall be invalid, beginning with the first unit operating hour on or after May 1. The owner or operator shall continue to invalidate all data from the CEMS until either:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The required RATA of the CEMS has been performed and passed; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A probationary calibration error test of the CEMS is passed in accordance with § 75.20(b)(3)(ii). Once the probationary calibration error test has been passed, the owner or operator shall perform the required RATA in accordance with the conditional data validation provisions and within the 720 unit or stack operating hour time frame specified in § 75.20(b)(3) (subject to the restrictions in paragraph (c)(3)(xii) of this section), and the term “quality assurance” shall apply instead of the term “recertification.” However, in lieu of the provisions in § 75.20(b)(3)(ix), the owner or operator shall follow the applicable provisions in paragraphs (c)(3)(xi) and (c)(3)(xii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Quality assurance requirements within the ozone season.</E> The provisions of this paragraph apply to each ozone season. The owner or operator shall, at a minimum, perform the following quality assurance testing during the ozone season, i.e. in the time period extending from May 1 through September 30 of each calendar year:</P>
              <P>(i) Daily calibration error tests and (if applicable) interference checks of each CEMS required by this subpart shall be performed in accordance with sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 of appendix B to this part. The applicable provisions in sections 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 of appendix B to this part, pertaining, respectively, to additional calibration error tests and calibration adjustments, data validation, and quality assurance of data with respect to daily assessments, shall also apply.</P>
              <P>(ii) For each gas monitor required by this subpart, linearity checks shall be performed in the second and third calendar quarters, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For the second calendar quarter, the pre-ozone season linearity check required under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall be performed by April 30.</P>
              <P>(B) For the third calendar quarter, a linearity check shall be performed and passed no later than July 30.</P>
              <P>(C) Conduct each linearity check in accordance with the general procedures in section 6.2 of appendix A to this part, except that the data validation procedures in sections 6.2(a) through (f) of appendix A do not apply.</P>
              <P>(D) Each linearity check shall be done “hands-off,” as described in section 2.2.3(c) of appendix B to this part.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Data Validation.</E> For second and third quarter linearity checks performed by the applicable deadline (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, April 30 or July 30), data validation shall be done in accordance with sections 2.2.3(a), (b), (c), (e), and (h) of Appendix B to this part. However, if a required linearity check for the second calendar quarter is not completed by April 30, or if a required linearity check for the third calendar quarter is not completed by July 30, data from the monitoring system (or range) shall be invalid, beginning with the first unit operating hour on or after May 1 or July 31, respectively. The owner or operator shall continue to invalidate all data from the CEMS until either:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The required linearity check of the CEMS has been performed and passed; or<PRTPAGE P="350"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A probationary calibration error test of the CEMS is passed in accordance with § 75.20(b)(3)(ii). Once the probationary calibration error test has been passed, the owner or operator shall perform the required linearity check in accordance with the conditional data validation provisions and within the 168 unit or stack operating hour time frame specified in § 75.20(b)(3) (subject to the restrictions in paragraph (c)(3)(xii) of this section), and the term “quality assurance” shall apply instead of the term “recertification.” However, in lieu of the provisions in § 75.20(b)(3)(ix), the owner or operator shall follow the applicable provisions in paragraphs (c)(3)(xi) and (c)(3)(xii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(F) A pre-season linearity check performed and passed in April satisfies the linearity check requirement for the second quarter.</P>
              <P>(G) The third quarter linearity check requirement in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section is waived if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Due to infrequent unit operation, the 168 operating hour conditional data validation period associated with a pre-season linearity check extends into the third quarter; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A linearity check is performed and passed within that conditional data validation period.</P>
              <P>(iii) For each flow monitoring system required by this subpart, except for flow monitors installed on non-load-based units that do not produce electrical or thermal output, flow-to-load ratio tests are required in the second and third calendar quarters, in accordance with section 2.2.5 of appendix B to this part. If the flow-to-load ratio test for the second calendar quarter is failed, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in section 2.2.5(c)(8) of appendix B to this part. If the flow-to-load ratio test for the third calendar quarter is failed, data from the flow monitor shall be considered invalid at the beginning of the next ozone season unless, prior to May 1 of the next calendar year, the owner or operator has either successfully implemented Option 1 in section 2.2.5.1 of appendix B to this part or Option 2 in section 2.2.5.2 of appendix B to this part, or unless a flow RATA has been performed and passed in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) For each differential pressure-type flow monitor used to meet the requirements of this subpart, quarterly leak checks are required in the second and third calendar quarters, in accordance with section 2.2.2 of appendix B to this part. For the second calendar quarter of the year, only the unit or stack operating hours in the months of May and June shall be used to determine whether the second calendar quarter is a QA operating quarter (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter). Data validation for quarterly flow monitor leak checks shall be done in accordance with section 2.2.3(g) of appendix B to this part. If the leak check for the third calendar quarter is failed and a subsequent leak check is not passed by the end of the ozone season, then data from the flow monitor shall be considered invalid at the beginning of the next ozone season unless a leak check is passed prior to May 1 of the next calendar year.</P>
              <P>(v) A fuel flow-to-load ratio test in section 2.1.7 of appendix D to this part shall be performed in the second and third calendar quarters if, for a unit using a fuel flowmeter to determine heat input under this subpart, the owner or operator has elected to use the fuel flow-to-load ratio test to extend the deadline for the next fuel flowmeter accuracy test. Automatic deadline extensions may be claimed for the two calendar quarters outside the ozone season (the first and fourth calendar quarters), since a fuel flow-to-load ratio test is not required in those quarters. If a fuel flow-to-load ratio test is failed, follow the applicable procedures and data validation provisions in section 2.1.7.4 of appendix D to this part. If the fuel flow-to-load ratio test for the third calendar quarter is failed, data from the fuel flowmeter shall be considered invalid at the beginning of the next ozone season unless the requirements of section 2.1.7.4 of appendix D to this part have been fully met prior to May 1 of the next calendar year.</P>
              <P>(vi)-(viii) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(ix) If, for any required CEMS, diagnostic linearity checks or RATAs other than those required by this section are <PRTPAGE P="351"/>performed during the ozone season, use the applicable data validation procedures in section 2.2.3 (for linearity checks) or 2.3.2 (for RATAs) of appendix B to this part.</P>
              <P>(x) If any required CEMS is recertified within the ozone season, use the data validation provisions in § 75.20(b)(3) and, if applicable, paragraphs (c)(3)(xi) and (c)(3)(xii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(xi) If, at the end of the second quarter of any calendar year, a required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test of a monitoring system has not been completed, and if data contained in the quarterly report are conditionally valid pending the results of test(s) to be completed in a subsequent quarter, the owner or operator shall indicate this by means of a suitable conditionally valid data flag in the electronic quarterly report for the second calendar quarter. The owner or operator shall resubmit the report for the second quarter if the required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test is subsequently failed. In the resubmitted report, the owner or operator shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data that was invalidated by the failed quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test. Alternatively, if any required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test is not completed by the end of the second calendar quarter but is completed no later than 30 days after the end of that quarter (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, prior to the deadline for submitting the quarterly report under § 75.73), the test data and results may be submitted with the second quarter report even though the test date(s) are from the third calendar quarter. In such instances, if the quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification test(s) are passed in accordance with the conditional data validation provisions of § 75.20(b)(3), conditionally valid data may be reported as quality-assured, in lieu of reporting a conditional data flag. If the tests are failed and if conditionally valid data are replaced, as appropriate, with substitute data, then neither the reporting of a conditional data flag nor resubmission is required.</P>
              <P>(xii) If, at the end of the third quarter of any calendar year, a required quality assurance, diagnostic or recertification test of a monitoring system has not been completed, and if data contained in the quarterly report are conditionally valid pending the results of test(s) to be completed, the owner or operator shall do one of the following:</P>
              <P>(A) If the results of the required tests are not available within 30 days of the end of the third calendar quarter and cannot be submitted with the quarterly report for the third calendar quarter, then the test results are considered to be missing and the owner or operator shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data in the third quarter report. In addition, if the data in the second quarterly report were flagged as conditionally valid at the end of the quarter, pending the results of the same missing tests, the owner or operator shall resubmit the report for the second quarter and shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data associated with the missing quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification tests; or</P>

              <P>(B) If the required quality assurance, diagnostic, or recertification tests are completed no later than 30 days after the end of the third calendar quarter, the test data and results may be submitted with the third quarter report even though the test date(s) are from the fourth calendar quarter. In this instance, if the required tests are passed in accordance with the conditional data validation provisions of § 75.20(b)(3), all conditionally valid data associated with the tests shall be reported as quality-assured. If the tests are failed, the owner or operator shall use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data associated with the failed test(s). In addition, if the data in the second quarterly report were flagged as conditionally valid at the end of the quarter, pending the results of the same failed test(s), the owner or operator shall resubmit the report for the second quarter and shall <PRTPAGE P="352"/>use the appropriate missing data routine in §§ 75.31 through § 75.37 to replace with substitute data each hour of conditionally valid data associated with the failed test(s).</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator of a unit using the procedures in appendix D of this part to determine heat input rate is required to maintain fuel flowmeters only during the ozone season, except that for purposes of determining the deadline for the next periodic quality assurance test on the fuel flowmeter, the owner or operator shall include all fuel flowmeter QA operating quarters (as defined in § 72.2) for the entire calendar year, not just fuel flowmeter QA operating quarters in the ozone season. For each calendar year, the owner or operator shall record, for each fuel flowmeter, the number of fuel flowmeter QA operating quarters. The owner or operator shall include all calendar quarters in the year when determining the deadline for visual inspection of the primary fuel flowmeter element, as specified in section 2.1.6(c) of appendix D to this part.</P>
              <P>(5) The owner or operator of a unit using the procedures in appendix D of this part to determine heat input rate is only required to sample fuel for the purposes of determining density and GCV during the ozone season, except that:</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling from the fuel storage tank upon delivery must sample the tank between the date and hour of the most recent delivery before the first date and hour that the unit operates in the ozone season and the first date and hour that the unit operates in the ozone season.</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling upon delivery from the delivery vehicle must ensure that all shipments received during the calendar year are sampled.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator of a unit that performs sampling on each day the unit combusts fuel or that performs fuel sampling continuously must sample the fuel starting on the first day the unit operates during the ozone season. The owner or operator then shall use that sampled value for all hours of combustion during the first day of unit operation, continuing until the date and hour of the next sample.</P>
              <P>(6) The owner or operator shall, in accordance with § 75.73, record and report the hourly data required by this subpart and shall record and report the results of all required quality assurance tests, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) All hourly emission data for the period of time from May 1 through September 30 of each calendar year shall be recorded and reported. For missing data purposes, only the data recorded in the time period from May 1 through September 30 shall be considered quality-assured;</P>
              <P>(ii) The results of all daily calibration error tests and flow monitor interference checks performed in the time period from May 1 through September 30 shall be recorded and reported;</P>

              <P>(iii) For the time periods described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(C) and (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, hourly emission data and the results of all daily calibration error tests and flow monitor interference checks shall be recorded. The owner or operator may opt to report unit operating data, daily calibration error test and flow monitor interference check results, and hourly emission data in the time period from April 1 through April 30. However, only the data recorded in the time period from May 1 through September 30 shall be used for NO<E T="52">X</E> mass compliance determination;</P>
              <P>(iv) The results of all required quality assurance tests (RATAs, linearity checks, flow-to-load ratio tests and leak checks) performed during the ozone season shall be reported in the appropriate ozone season quarterly report; and</P>

              <P>(v) The results of RATAs (and any other quality assurance test(s) required under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section) which affect data validation for the current ozone season, but which were performed outside the ozone season (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, between January 1 and April 30 of the current calendar year), shall be reported in the quarterly report for the second quarter of the current calendar year (or in the report for the third calendar quarter of the current calendar year, if the unit or stack does not operate in the second quarter).<PRTPAGE P="353"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) The owner or operator shall use only quality-assured data from within ozone seasons in the substitute data procedures under subpart D of this part and section 2.4.2 of appendix D to this part.</P>

              <P>(i) The lookback periods (e.g., 2160 quality-assured monitor operating hours for a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system, or a flow monitoring system) used to calculate missing data must include only quality-assured data from periods within ozone seasons.</P>

              <P>(ii) The applicable missing data procedures of §§ 75.31 through 75.37 shall be used, with one exception. When a fuel which has a significantly higher NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate than any of the fuel(s) combusted in prior ozone seasons is combusted in the unit, and no quality-assured NO<E T="52">X</E> data have been recorded in the current, or any previous, ozone season while combusting the new fuel, the owner or operator shall substitute the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, from a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, or the maximum potential concentration of NO<E T="52">X</E>, as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, from a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system. The maximum potential value used shall be specific to the new fuel. The owner or operator shall substitute the maximum potential value for each hour of missing NO<E T="52">X</E> data until the first hour that quality-assured NO<E T="52">X</E> data are obtained while combusting the new fuel, and then shall resume use of the missing data routines in §§ 75.31 through 75.37; and</P>
              <P>(iii) In order to apply the missing data routines described in §§ 75.31 through 75.37 on an ozone season-only basis, the procedures in those sections shall be modified as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The use of the initial missing data procedures in § 75.31 shall commence with the first unit operating hour in the first ozone season for which emissions data are required to be reported under § 75.64.</P>
              <P>(B) In § 75.31(a), the phrases “During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” and “during the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” apply respectively instead of the phrases “During the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours” and “during the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours”.</P>
              <P>(C) In § 75.32(a), the phrases “the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” and “the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” apply, respectively, instead of the phrases “the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours” and “the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours”.</P>
              <P>(D) In § 75.32(a)(1), the phrase “Following initial certification, prior to completion of 3,672 unit (or stack) operating hours within the ozone season” applies instead of the phrase “Prior to completion of 8,760 unit (or stack) operating hours following initial certification”.</P>
              <P>(E) In Equation 8, the phrase “Total unit operating hours within the ozone season” applies instead of the phrase “Total unit operating hours”.</P>
              <P>(F) In § 75.32(a)(2), the phrase “3,672 unit (or stack) operating hours within the ozone season” applies instead of the phrase “8,760 unit (or stack) operating hours”.</P>
              <P>(G) In the numerator of Equation 9, the phrase “Total unit operating hours within the ozone season” applies instead of the phrase “Total unit operating hours”, and the phrase “3,672 unit operating hours within the ozone season” applies instead of the phrase “8,760 unit operating hours”. In the denominator of Equation 9, the number “3,672” applies instead of “8,760”.</P>

              <P>(H) Use the following instead of the first three sentences in § 75.32(a)(3): “When calculating percent monitor data availability using Equation 8 or 9, the owner or operator shall include all unit or stack operating hours within the ozone season, and all monitor operating hours within the ozone season for which quality-assured data were recorded by a certified primary monitor; a certified redundant or non-redundant backup monitor or a reference method for that unit; or by an approved alternative monitoring system under subpart E of this part. No hours from more than three years (26,280 clock hours) <PRTPAGE P="354"/>earlier shall be used in Equation 9. For a unit that has accumulated fewer than 3,672 ozone season operating hours in the previous three years, use the following: in the numerator of Equation 9 use ‘Total unit operating hours within the ozone season for which quality-assured data were recorded in the previous three years’; and in the denominator of Equation 9 use ‘Total unit operating hours within the ozone season, in the previous three years’ ”</P>
              <P>(I) In § 75.33(a), the phrases “the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” and “the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” apply, respectively, instead of the phrases “the first 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours” and “the first 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours”.</P>
              <P>(J) Instead of the last sentence of § 75.33(a), use “For the purposes of missing data substitution, the owner or operator of a unit shall use only quality-assured monitor operating hours of data that were recorded within the ozone season and no more than three years (26,280 clock hours) prior to the date and time of the missing data period.”</P>
              <P>(K) In §§ 75.33(b), 75.33(c), 75.35, 75.36, and 75.37, the phrases “720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” and “2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” apply, respectively, instead of the phrases “720 quality-assured monitor operating hours” and “2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours”.</P>
              <P>(L) In § 75.34(a)(3) and (a)(5), the phrases “720 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” and “2160 quality-assured monitor operating hours within the ozone season” apply instead of “720 quality-assured monitor operating hours” and “2160 quality-assured monitor operating hours”, respectively.</P>
              <P>(8) The owner or operator of a unit with NO<E T="52">X</E> add-on emission controls or a unit capable of combusting more than one fuel shall keep records during ozone season in a form suitable for inspection to demonstrate that the typical NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate or NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration during the prior ozone season(s) included in the missing data lookback period is representative of the ozone season in which missing data are substituted and that use of the missing data procedures will not systematically underestimate NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions. These records shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) For units that can combust more than one fuel, the fuel or fuels combusted each hour; and</P>
              <P>(ii) For units with add-on emission controls, using the missing data options in §§ 75.34(a)(1) through 75.34(a)(5), the range of operating parameters for add-on emission controls (as defined in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit required by section 1 in appendix B to this part) and information for verifying proper operation of the add-on emission controls during missing data periods, as described in § 75.34(d).</P>

              <P>(9) The designated representative shall certify with each quarterly report that NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate values or NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration values substituted for missing data under subpart D of this part are calculated using only values from an ozone season, that substitute values measured during the prior ozone season(s) included in the missing data lookback period are representative of the ozone season in which missing data are substituted, and that NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions are not systematically underestimated.</P>

              <P>(10) Units may qualify to use the low mass emissions excepted monitoring methodology in § 75.19 on an ozone season basis. In order to be allowed to use this methodology, a unit may not emit more than 50 tons of NO<E T="52">X</E> per ozone season, as provided in § 75.19(a)(1)(i)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>). If any low mass emissions unit fails to provide a demonstration that its ozone season NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions are less than or equal to 50 tons, then the unit is disqualified from using the methodology. The owner or operator must install and certify any equipment needed to ensure that the unit is monitored using an acceptable methodology by December 31 of the following year.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">1. Installation and Measurement Location</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.1 Gas Monitors</HD>

              <P>(a) Following the procedures in section 8.1.1 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter, install the pollutant concentration monitor or monitoring system at a location where the pollutant concentration and emission rate measurements are directly representative of the total emissions from the affected unit. Select a representative measurement point or path for the monitor probe(s) (or for the path from the transmitter to the receiver) such that the SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, or NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system or NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS (NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitor and diluent gas monitor) will pass the relative accuracy test (<E T="03">see</E> section 6 of this appendix).</P>
              <P>(b) It is recommended that monitor measurements be made at locations where the exhaust gas temperature is above the dew-point temperature. If the cause of failure to meet the relative accuracy tests is determined to be the measurement location, relocate the monitor probe(s).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1.1.1 Point Monitors</HD>
              <P>Locate the measurement point (1) within the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section, or (2) no less than 1.0 meter from the stack or duct wall.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1.1.2 Path Monitors</HD>
              <P>Locate the measurement path (1) totally within the inner area bounded by a line 1.0 meter from the stack or duct wall, or (2) such that at least 70.0 percent of the path is within the inner 50.0 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area, or (3) such that the path is centrally located within any part of the centroidal area.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.2 Flow Monitors</HD>

              <P>Install the flow monitor in a location that provides representative volumetric flow over all operating conditions. Such a location is one that provides an average velocity of the flue gas flow over the stack or duct cross section, provides a representative SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate (in lb/hr), and is representative of the pollutant concentration monitor location. Where the moisture content of the flue gas affects volumetric flow measurements, use the procedures in both Reference Methods 1 and 4 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to establish a proper location for the flow monitor. The EPA recommends (but does not require) performing a flow profile study following the procedures in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method, 1, sections 11.5 or 11.4 for each of the three operating or load levels indicated in section 6.5.2.1 of this appendix to determine the acceptability of the potential flow monitor location and to determine the number and location of flow sampling points required to obtain a representative flow value. The procedure in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Test Method 1, section 11.5 may be used even if the flow measurement location is greater than or equal to 2 equivalent stack or duct diameters downstream or greater than or equal to <FR>1/2</FR> duct diameter upstream from a flow disturbance. If a flow profile study shows that cyclonic (or swirling) or stratified flow conditions exist at the potential flow monitor location that are likely to prevent the monitor from meeting the performance specifications of this part, then EPA recommends either (1) selecting another location where there is no cyclonic (or swirling) or stratified flow condition, or (2) eliminating the cyclonic (or swirling) or stratified flow condition by straightening the flow, e.g., by installing straightening <PRTPAGE P="356"/>vanes. EPA also recommends selecting flow monitor locations to minimize the effects of condensation, coating, erosion, or other conditions that could adversely affect flow monitor performance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1.2.1 Acceptability of Monitor Location</HD>
              <P>The installation of a flow monitor is acceptable if either (1) the location satisfies the minimum siting criteria of method 1 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter (i.e., the location is greater than or equal to eight stack or duct diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from a flow disturbance; or, if necessary, two stack or duct diameters downstream and one-half stack or duct diameter upstream from a flow disturbance), or (2) the results of a flow profile study, if performed, are acceptable (i.e., there are no cyclonic (or swirling) or stratified flow conditions), and the flow monitor also satisfies the performance specifications of this part. If the flow monitor is installed in a location that does not satisfy these physical criteria, but nevertheless the monitor achieves the performance specifications of this part, then the location is acceptable, notwithstanding the requirements of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1.2.2 Alternative Monitoring Location</HD>
              <P>Whenever the owner or operator successfully demonstrates that modifications to the exhaust duct or stack (such as installation of straightening vanes, modifications of ductwork, and the like) are necessary for the flow monitor to meet the performance specifications, the Administrator may approve an interim alternative flow monitoring methodology and an extension to the required certification date for the flow monitor.</P>
              <P>Where no location exists that satisfies the physical siting criteria in section 1.2.1, where the results of flow profile studies performed at two or more alternative flow monitor locations are unacceptable, or where installation of a flow monitor in either the stack or the ducts is demonstrated to be technically infeasible, the owner or operator may petition the Administrator for an alternative method for monitoring flow.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Equipment Specifications</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.1 Instrument Span and Range</HD>

              <P>In implementing sections 2.1.1 through 2.1.6 of this appendix, set the measurement range for each parameter (SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, or flow rate) high enough to prevent full-scale exceedances from occurring, yet low enough to ensure good measurement accuracy and to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio. To meet these objectives, select the range such that the majority of the readings obtained during typical unit operation are kept, to the extent practicable, between 20.0 and 80.0 percent of the full-scale range of the instrument. These guidelines do not apply to: (1) SO<E T="52">2</E> readings obtained during the combustion of very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter); (2) SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> readings recorded on the high measurement range, for units with SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls and two span values, unless the emission controls are operated seasonally (for example, only during the ozone season); or (3) SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> readings less than 20.0 percent of full-scale on the low measurement range for a dual span unit, provided that the maximum expected concentration (MEC), low-scale span value, and low-scale range settings have been determined according to sections 2.1.1.2, 2.1.1.4(a), (b), and (g) of this appendix (for SO<E T="52">2</E>), or according to sections 2.1.2.2, 2.1.2.4(a) and (f) of this appendix (for NO<E T="52">X</E>).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.1 SO<E T="52">2</E> Pollutant Concentration Monitors</HD>

              <P>Determine, as indicated in sections 2.1.1.1 through 2.1.1.5 of this appendix the span value(s) and range(s) for an SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor so that all potential and expected concentrations can be accurately measured and recorded. Note that if a unit exclusively combusts fuels that are very low sulfur fuels (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor span requirements in § 75.11(e)(3)(iv) apply in lieu of the requirements of this section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.1.1 Maximum Potential Concentration</HD>

              <P>(a) Make an initial determination of the maximum potential concentration (MPC) of SO<E T="52">2</E> by using Equation A-1a or A-1b. Base the MPC calculation on the maximum percent sulfur and the minimum gross calorific value (GCV) for the highest-sulfur fuel to be burned. The maximum sulfur content and minimum GCV shall be determined from all available fuel sampling and analysis data for that fuel from the previous 12 months (minimum), excluding clearly anomalous fuel sampling values. If both the fuel sulfur content and the GCV are routinely determined from each fuel sample, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to using the highest individual percent sulfur and lowest individual GCV values in the MPC calculation, pair the sulfur content and GCV values from each sample analysis and calculate the ratio of percent sulfur to GCV (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> %S/GCV) for each pair of values. If this option is selected, the MPC shall be calculated using the highest %S/GCV ratio in Equation A-1a or A-1b. If the designated representative certifies that the highest-sulfur fuel is never burned alone in the unit during normal operation but is always blended or co-fired with other fuel(s), the MPC may be calculated using a best estimate of the highest sulfur content and lowest gross calorific value expected for the blend or fuel mixture and inserting these values into Equation A-1a or A-1b. Derive <PRTPAGE P="357"/>the best estimate of the highest percent sulfur and lowest GCV for a blend or fuel mixture from weighted-average values based upon the historical composition of the blend or mixture in the previous 12 (or more) months. If insufficient representative fuel sampling data are available to determine the maximum sulfur content and minimum GCV, use values from contract(s) for the fuel(s) that will be combusted by the unit in the MPC calculation.</P>

              <P>(b) Alternatively, if a certified SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS is already installed, the owner or operator may make the initial MPC determination based upon quality-assured historical data recorded by the CEMS. For the purposes of this section, 2.1.1.1, a “certified” CEMS means a CEM system that has met the applicable certification requirements of either: This part, or part 60 of this chapter, or a State CEM program, or the source operating permit. If this option is chosen, the MPC shall be the maximum SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration observed during the previous 720 (or more) quality-assured monitor operating hours when combusting the highest-sulfur fuel (or highest-sulfur blend if fuels are always blended or co-fired) that is to be combusted in the unit or units monitored by the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor. For units with SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, the certified SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor used to determine the MPC must be located at or before the control device inlet. Report the MPC and the method of determination in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53. Note that the initial MPC value is subject to periodic review under section 2.1.1.5 of this appendix. If an MPC value is found to be either inappropriately high or low, the MPC shall be adjusted in accordance with section 2.1.1.5, and corresponding span and range adjustments shall be made, if necessary.</P>
              <P>(c) When performing fuel sampling to determine the MPC, use ASTM Methods: ASTM D129-00, ASTM D240-00, ASTM D1552-01, ASTM D2622-98, ASTM D3176-89 (Reapproved 2002), ASTM D3177-02 (Reapproved 2007), ASTM D4239-02, ASTM D4294-98, ASTM D5865-01a, or ASTM D5865-10 (all incorporated by reference under § 75.6).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.1.2 Maximum Expected Concentration</HD>

              <P>(a) Make an initial determination of the maximum expected concentration (MEC) of SO<E T="52">2</E> whenever: (a) SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls are used; or (b) both high-sulfur and low-sulfur fuels (e.g., high-sulfur coal and low-sulfur coal or different grades of fuel oil) or high-sulfur and low-sulfur fuel blends are combusted as primary or backup fuels in a unit without SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls. For units with SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, use Equation A-<PRTPAGE P="358"/>2 to make the initial MEC determination. When high-sulfur and low-sulfur fuels or blends are burned as primary or backup fuels in a unit without SO<E T="52">2</E> controls, use Equation A-1a or A-1b to calculate the initial MEC value for each fuel or blend, except for: (1) the highest-sulfur fuel or blend (for which the MPC was previously calculated in section 2.1.1.1 of this appendix); (2) fuels or blends that are very low sulfur fuels (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter); or (3) fuels or blends that are used only for unit startup. Each initial MEC value shall be documented in the monitoring plan required under § 75.53. Note that each initial MEC value is subject to periodic review under section 2.1.1.5 of this appendix. If an MEC value is found to be either inappropriately high or low, the MEC shall be adjusted in accordance with section 2.1.1.5, and corresponding span and range adjustments shall be made, if necessary.</P>
              <P>(b) For each MEC determination, substitute into Equation A-1a or A-1b the highest sulfur content and minimum GCV value for that fuel or blend, based upon all available fuel sampling and analysis results from the previous 12 months (or more), or, if fuel sampling data are unavailable, based upon fuel contract(s).</P>
              <P>(c) Alternatively, if a certified SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS is already installed, the owner or operator may make the initial MEC determination(s) based upon historical monitoring data. For the purposes of this section, 2.1.1.2, a “certified” CEMS means a CEM system that has met the applicable certification requirements of either: This part, or part 60 of this chapter, or a State CEM program, or the source operating permit. If this option is chosen for a unit with SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, the MEC shall be the maximum SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration measured downstream of the control device outlet by the CEMS over the previous 720 (or more) quality-assured monitor operating hours with the unit and the control device both operating normally. For units that burn high- and low-sulfur fuels or blends as primary and backup fuels and have no SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, the MEC for each fuel shall be the maximum SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration measured by the CEMS over the previous 720 (or more) quality-assured monitor operating hours in which that fuel or blend was the only fuel being burned in the unit.</P>

              <P>Determine the high span value and the high full-scale range of the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor as follows. (Note: For purposes of this part, the high span and range refer, respectively, either to the span and range of a single span unit or to the high span and range of a dual span unit.) The high span value shall be obtained by multiplying the MPC by a factor no less than 1.00 and no greater than 1.25. Round the span value upward to the next highest multiple of 100 ppm. If the SO<E T="52">2</E> span concentration is ≤500 ppm, the span value may either be rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm, or to the next highest multiple of 100 ppm. The high span value shall be used to determine concentrations of the calibration gases required for daily calibration error checks and linearity tests. Select the full-scale range of the instrument to be consistent with section 2.1 of this appendix and to be greater than or equal to the span value. Report the full-scale range setting and calculations of the MPC and span in the monitoring plan for the unit. Note that for certain applications, a second (low) SO<E T="52">2</E> span and range may be required (see section 2.1.1.4 of this appendix). If an existing State, local, or federal requirement for span of an SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor requires or allows the use of a span value lower than that required by this section or by section 2.1.1.4 of this appendix, the State, local, or federal span value may be used if a satisfactory explanation is included in the monitoring plan, unless span and/or range adjustments become necessary in accordance with section 2.1.1.5 of this appendix. Span values higher than those required by either this section or section 2.1.1.4 of this appendix must be approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.1.4 Dual Span and Range Requirements</HD>

              <P>For most units, the high span value based on the MPC, as determined under section 2.1.1.3 of this appendix will suffice to measure and record SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations (unless span and/or range adjustments become necessary in accordance with section 2.1.1.5 of this appendix). In some instances, however, a second (low) span value based on the MEC may be required to ensure accurate measurement of all possible or expected SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations. To determine whether two SO<E T="52">2</E> span values are required, proceed as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) For units with SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, compare the MEC from section 2.1.1.2 of this appendix to the high full-scale range value from section 2.1.1.3 of this appendix. If the MEC is ≥20.0 percent of the high range value, then the high span value and range determined under section 2.1.1.3 of this appendix are sufficient. If the MEC is &lt;20.0 percent of the high range value, then a second (low) span value is required.<PRTPAGE P="359"/>
              </P>

              <P>(b) For units that combust high- and low-sulfur primary and backup fuels (or blends) and have no SO<E T="52">2</E> controls, compare the high range value from section 2.1.1.3 of this appendix (for the highest-sulfur fuel or blend) to the MEC value for each of the other fuels or blends, as determined under section 2.1.1.2 of this appendix. If all of the MEC values are ≥20.0 percent of the high range value, the high span and range determined under section 2.1.1.3 of this appendix are sufficient, regardless of which fuel or blend is burned in the unit. If any MEC value is &lt;20.0 percent of the high range value, then a second (low) span value must be used when that fuel or blend is combusted.</P>
              <P>(c) When two SO<E T="52">2</E> spans are required, the owner or operator may either use a single SO<E T="52">2</E> analyzer with a dual range (i.e., low- and high-scales) or two separate SO<E T="52">2</E> analyzers connected to a common sample probe and sample interface. Alternatively, if RATAs are performed and passed on both measurement ranges, the owner or operator may use two separate SO<E T="52">2</E> analyzers connected to separate probes and sample interfaces. For units with SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, the owner or operator may use a low range analyzer and a default high range value, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, in lieu of maintaining and quality assuring a high-scale range. Other monitor configurations are subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(d) The owner or operator shall designate the monitoring systems and components in the monitoring plan under § 75.53 as follows: when a single probe and sample interface are used, either designate the low and high monitor ranges as separate SO<E T="52">2</E> components of a single, primary SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system; designate the low and high monitor ranges as the SO<E T="52">2</E> components of two separate, primary SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring systems; designate the normal monitor range as a primary monitoring system and the other monitor range as a non-redundant backup monitoring system; or, when a single, dual-range SO<E T="52">2</E> analyzer is used, designate the low and high ranges as a single SO<E T="52">2</E> component of a primary SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system (if this option is selected, use a special dual-range component type code, as specified by the Administrator, to satisfy the requirements of § 75.53(e)(1)(iv)(D)). When two SO<E T="52">2</E> analyzers are connected to separate probes and sample interfaces, designate the analyzers as the SO<E T="52">2</E> components of two separate, primary SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring systems. For units with SO<E T="52">2</E> controls, if the default high range value is used, designate the low range analyzer as the SO<E T="52">2</E> component of a primary SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system. Do not designate the default high range as a monitoring system or component. Other component and system designations are subject to approval by the Administrator. Note that the component and system designations for redundant backup monitoring systems shall be the same as for primary monitoring systems.</P>

              <P>(e) Each monitoring system designated as primary or redundant backup shall meet the initial certification and quality assurance requirements for primary monitoring systems in § 75.20(c) or § 75.20(d)(1), as applicable, and appendices A and B to this part, with one exception: relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) are required only on the normal range (for units with SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, the low range is considered normal). Each monitoring system designated as a non-redundant backup shall meet the applicable quality assurance requirements in § 75.20(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(f) For dual span units with SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to maintaining and quality assuring a high monitor range, use a default high range value. If this option is chosen, the owner or operator shall report a default SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration of 200 percent of the MPC for each unit operating hour in which the full-scale of the low range SO<E T="52">2</E> analyzer is exceeded.</P>

              <P>(g) The high span value and range shall be determined in accordance with section 2.1.1.3 of this appendix. The low span value shall be obtained by multiplying the MEC by a factor no less than 1.00 and no greater than 1.25, and rounding the result upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm (or 100 ppm, as appropriate). For units that burn high- and low-sulfur primary and backup fuels or blends and have no SO<E T="52">2</E> emission controls, select, as the basis for calculating the appropriate low span value and range, the fuel-specific MEC value closest to 20.0 percent of the high full-scale range value (from paragraph (b) of this section). The low range must be greater than or equal to the low span value, and the required calibration gases must be selected based on the low span value. However, if the default high range option in paragraph (f) of this section is selected, the full-scale of the low measurement range shall not exceed five times the MEC value (where the MEC is rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm). For units with two SO<E T="52">2</E> spans, use the low range whenever the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations are expected to be consistently below 20.0 percent of the high full-scale range value, i.e., when the MEC of the fuel or blend being combusted is less than 20.0 percent of the high full-scale range value. When the full-scale of the low range is exceeded, the high range shall be used to measure and record the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations; or, if applicable, the default high range value in paragraph (f) of this section shall be reported for each hour of the full-scale exceedance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.1.5 Adjustment of Span and Range</HD>

              <P>For each affected unit or common stack, the owner or operator shall make a periodic evaluation of the MPC, MEC, span, and range <PRTPAGE P="360"/>values for each SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor (at a minimum, an annual evaluation is required) and shall make any necessary span and range adjustments, with corresponding monitoring plan updates, as described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Span and range adjustments may be required, for example, as a result of changes in the fuel supply, changes in the manner of operation of the unit, or installation or removal of emission controls. In implementing the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, SO<E T="52">2</E> data recorded during short-term, non-representative process operating conditions (e.g., a trial burn of a different type of fuel) shall be excluded from consideration. The owner or operator shall keep the results of the most recent span and range evaluation on-site, in a format suitable for inspection. Make each required span or range adjustment no later than 45 days after the end of the quarter in which the need to adjust the span or range is identified, except that up to 90 days after the end of that quarter may be taken to implement a span adjustment if the calibration gases currently being used for daily calibration error tests and linearity checks are unsuitable for use with the new span value.</P>
              <P>(a) If the fuel supply, the composition of the fuel blend(s), the emission controls, or the manner of operation change such that the maximum expected or potential concentration changes significantly, adjust the span and range setting to assure the continued accuracy of the monitoring system. A “significant” change in the MPC or MEC means that the guidelines in section 2.1 of this appendix can no longer be met, as determined by either a periodic evaluation by the owner or operator or from the results of an audit by the Administrator. The owner or operator should evaluate whether any planned changes in operation of the unit may affect the concentration of emissions being emitted from the unit or stack and should plan any necessary span and range changes needed to account for these changes, so that they are made in as timely a manner as practicable to coordinate with the operational changes. Determine the adjusted span(s) using the procedures in sections 2.1.1.3 and 2.1.1.4 of this appendix (as applicable). Select the full-scale range(s) of the instrument to be greater than or equal to the new span value(s) and to be consistent with the guidelines of section 2.1 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever a full-scale range is exceeded during a quarter and the exceedance is not caused by a monitor out-of-control period, proceed as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) For exceedances of the high range, report 200.0 percent of the current full-scale range as the hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration for each hour of the full-scale exceedance and make appropriate adjustments to the MPC, span, and range to prevent future full-scale exceedances.</P>
              <P>(2) For units with two SO<E T="52">2</E> spans and ranges, if the low range is exceeded, no further action is required, provided that the high range is available and its most recent calibration error test and linearity check have not expired. However, if either of these quality assurance tests has expired and the high range is not able to provide quality assured data at the time of the low range exceedance or at any time during the continuation of the exceedance, report the MPC as the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration until the readings return to the low range or until the high range is able to provide quality assured data (unless the reason that the high-scale range is not able to provide quality assured data is because the high-scale range has been exceeded; if the high-scale range is exceeded follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section).</P>

              <P>(c) Whenever changes are made to the MPC, MEC, full-scale range, or span value of the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor, as described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, record and report (as applicable) the new full-scale range setting, the new MPC or MEC and calculations of the adjusted span value in an updated monitoring plan. The monitoring plan update shall be made in the quarter in which the changes become effective. In addition, record and report the adjusted span as part of the records for the daily calibration error test and linearity check specified by appendix B to this part. Whenever the span value is adjusted, use calibration gas concentrations that meet the requirements of section 5.1 of this appendix, based on the adjusted span value. When a span adjustment is so significant that the calibration gases currently being used for daily calibration error tests and linearity checks are unsuitable for use with the new span value, then a diagnostic linearity test using the new calibration gases must be performed and passed. Use the data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3), beginning with the hour in which the span is changed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2 NO<E T="52">X</E> Pollutant Concentration Monitors</HD>

              <P>Determine, as indicated in sections 2.1.2.1 through 2.1.2.5 of this appendix, the span and range value(s) for the NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitor so that all expected NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations can be determined and recorded accurately.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2.1 Maximum Potential Concentration</HD>
              <P>(a) The maximum potential concentration (MPC) of NO<E T="52">X</E> for each affected unit shall be based upon whichever fuel or blend combusted in the unit produces the highest level of NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions. For the purposes of this section, 2.1.2.1, and section 2.1.2.2 of this appendix, a “blend” means a frequently-used fuel mixture having a consistent composition (e.g., an oil and gas mixture where the <PRTPAGE P="361"/>relative proportions of the two fuels vary by no more than 10%, on average). Make an initial determination of the MPC using the appropriate option as follows:</P>

              <P>Option 1: Use 800 ppm for coal-fired and 400 ppm for oil- or gas-fired units as the maximum potential concentration of NO<E T="52">X</E> (if an MPC of 1600 ppm for coal-fired units or 480 ppm for oil- or gas-fired units was previously selected under this section, that value may still be used, provided that the guidelines of section 2.1 of this appendix are met); For cement kilns, use 2000 ppm as the MPC. For process heaters, use 200 ppm if the unit burns only gaseous fuel and 500 ppm if the unit burns oil;</P>
              <P>Option 2: Use the specific values based on boiler type and fuel combusted, listed in Table 2-1 or Table 2-2; For a new gas-fired or oil-fired combustion turbine, if a default MPC value of 50 ppm was previously selected from Table 2-2, that value may be used until March 31, 2003;</P>
              <P>Option 3: Use NO<E T="52">X</E> emission test results;</P>

              <P>Option 4: Use historical CEM data over the previous 720 (or more) unit operating hours when combusting the fuel or blend with the highest NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate; or</P>

              <P>Option 5: If a reliable estimate of the uncontrolled NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions from the unit is available from the manufacturer, the estimated value may be used.</P>

              <P>(b) For the purpose of providing substitute data during NO<E T="52">X</E> missing data periods in accordance with §§ 75.31 and 75.33 and as required elsewhere under this part, the owner or operator shall also calculate the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MER), in lb/mmBtu, by substituting the MPC for NO<E T="52">X</E> in conjunction with the minimum expected CO<E T="52">2</E> or maximum O<E T="52">2</E> concentration (under all unit operating conditions except for unit startup, shutdown, and upsets) and the appropriate F-factor into the applicable equation in appendix F to this part. The diluent cap value of 5.0 percent CO<E T="52">2</E> (or 14.0 percent O<E T="52">2</E>) for boilers or 1.0 percent CO<E T="52">2</E> (or 19.0 percent O<E T="52">2</E>) for combustion turbines may be used in the NO<E T="52">X</E> MER calculation. As a second alternative, when the NO<E T="52">X</E> MPC is determined from emission test results or from historical CEM data, as described in paragraphs (a), (d) and (e) of this section, quality-assured diluent gas (i.e., O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E>) data recorded concurrently with the MPC may be used to calculate the MER.</P>

              <P>(c) Report the method of determining the initial MPC and the calculation of the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in the monitoring plan for the unit. Note that whichever MPC option in paragraph 2.1.2.1(a) of this appendix is selected, the initial MPC value is subject to periodic review under section 2.1.2.5 of this appendix. If an MPC value is found to be either inappropriately high or low, the MPC shall be adjusted in accordance with section 2.1.2.5, and corresponding span and range adjustments shall be made, if necessary.</P>
              <P>(d) For units with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> controls (whether or not the unit is equipped with low-NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology), or for units equipped with dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> (DLN) technology, NO<E T="52">X</E> emission testing may only be used to determine the MPC if testing can be performed either upstream of the add-on controls or during a time or season when the add-on controls are not in operation or when the DLN controls are not in the premixed (low-NO<E T="52">X</E>) mode. If NO<E T="52">X</E> emission testing is performed, use the following guidelines. Use Method 7E from appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to measure total NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration. (Note: Method 20 from appendix A to part 60 may be used for gas turbines, instead of Method 7E.) Operate the unit, or group of units sharing a common stack, at the minimum safe and stable load, the normal load, and the maximum load. If the normal load and maximum load are identical, an intermediate level need not be tested. Operate at the highest excess O<E T="52">2</E> level expected under normal operating conditions. Make at least three runs of 20 minutes (minimum) duration with three traverse points per run at each operating condition. Select the highest point NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration from all test runs as the MPC for NO<E T="52">X</E>.</P>

              <P>(e) If historical CEM data are used to determine the MPC, the data must, for uncontrolled units or units equipped with low-NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology and no other NO<E T="52">X</E> controls, represent a minimum of 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours from the NO<E T="52">X</E> component of a certified monitoring system, obtained under various operating conditions including the minimum safe and stable load, normal load (including periods of high excess air at normal load), and maximum load. For the purposes of this section, 2.1.2.1, a “certified” CEMS means a CEM system that has met the applicable certification requirements of either: this part, or part 60 of this chapter, or a State CEM program, or the source operating permit. For a unit with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> controls (whether or not the unit is equipped with low-NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology), or for a unit equipped with dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> (DLN) technology, historical CEM data may only be used to determine the MPC if the 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours of CEM data are collected upstream of the add-on controls or if the 720 hours of data include periods when the add-on controls are not in operation or when the DLN controls are not in the premixed (low-NO<E T="52">X</E> mode). For units that do not produce electrical or thermal output, the data must represent the full range of normal process operation. The highest hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration in ppm shall be the MPC.<PRTPAGE P="362"/>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2.2 Maximum Expected Concentration</HD>

              <P>(a) Make an initial determination of the maximum expected concentration (MEC) of NO<E T="52">X</E> during normal operation for affected units with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> controls of any kind (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> steam injection, water injection, SCR, or SNCR) and for turbines that use dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> technology. Determine a separate MEC value for each type of fuel (or blend) combusted in the unit, except for fuels that are only used for unit startup and/or flame stabilization. Calculate the MEC of NO<E T="52">X</E> using Equation A-2, if applicable, inserting the maximum potential concentration, as determined using the procedures in section 2.1.2.1 of this appendix. Where Equation A-2 is not applicable, set the MEC either by: (1) measuring the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration using the testing procedures in this section; (2) using historical CEM data over the previous 720 (or more) quality-assured monitor operating hours; or (3) if the unit has add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> controls or uses dry low NO<E T="52">X</E> technology, and has a federally-enforceable permit limit for NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, the permit limit may be used as the MEC. Include in the monitoring plan for the unit each MEC value and the method by which the MEC was determined. Note that each initial MEC value is subject to periodic review under section 2.1.2.5 of this appendix. If an MEC value is found to be either inappropriately high or low, the MEC shall be adjusted in accordance with section 2.1.2.5, and corresponding span and range adjustments shall be made, if necessary.</P>
              <P>(b) If NO<E T="52">X</E> emission testing is used to determine the MEC value(s), the MEC for each type of fuel (or blend) shall be based upon testing at minimum load, normal load, and maximum load. At least three tests of 20 minutes (minimum) duration, using at least three traverse points, shall be performed at each load, using Method 7E from appendix A to part 60 of this chapter (Note: Method 20 from appendix A to part 60 may be used for gas turbines instead of Method 7E). The test must be performed at a time when all NO<E T="52">X</E> control devices and methods used to reduce NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions (if applicable) are operating properly. The testing shall be conducted downstream of all NO<E T="52">X</E> controls. The highest point NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration (e.g., the highest one-minute average) recorded during any of the test runs shall be the MEC.</P>

              <P>(c)If historical CEM data are used to determine the MEC value(s), the MEC for each type of fuel shall be based upon 720 (or more) hours of quality-assured data from the NO<E T="52">X</E> component of a certified monitoring system representing the entire load range under stable operating conditions. For the purposes of this section, 2.1.2.2, a “certified” CEMS means a CEM system that has met the applicable certification requirements of either: <PRTPAGE P="363"/>this part, or part 60 of this chapter, or a State CEM program, or the source operating permit. The data base for the MEC shall not include any CEM data recorded during unit startup, shutdown, or malfunction or (for units with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> controls or turbines using dry low NO<E T="52">X</E> technology) during any NO<E T="52">X</E> control device malfunctions or outages. All NO<E T="52">X</E> control devices and methods used to reduce NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions (if applicable) must be operating properly during each hour. The CEM data shall be collected downstream of all NO<E T="52">X</E> controls. For each type of fuel, the highest of the 720 (or more) quality-assured hourly average NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations recorded by the CEMS shall be the MEC.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2.3 Span Value(s) and Range(s)</HD>
              <P>(a) Determine the high span value of the NO<E T="52">X</E> monitor as follows. The high span value shall be obtained by multiplying the MPC by a factor no less than 1.00 and no greater than 1.25. Round the span value upward to the next highest multiple of 100 ppm. If the NO<E T="52">X</E> span concentration is ≤500 ppm, the span value may either be rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm, or to the next highest multiple of 100 ppm. The high span value shall be used to determine the concentrations of the calibration gases required for daily calibration error checks and linearity tests. Note that for certain applications, a second (low) NO<E T="52">X</E> span and range may be required (see section 2.1.2.4 of this appendix).</P>

              <P>(b) If an existing State, local, or federal requirement for span of a NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitor requires or allows the use of a span value lower than that required by this section or by section 2.1.2.4 of this appendix, the State, local, or federal span value may be used, where a satisfactory explanation is included in the monitoring plan, unless span and/or range adjustments become necessary in accordance with section 2.1.2.5 of this appendix. Span values higher than required by this section or by section 2.1.2.4 of this appendix must be approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) Select the full-scale range of the instrument to be consistent with section 2.1 of this appendix and to be greater than or equal to the high span value. Include the full-scale range setting and calculations of the MPC and span in the monitoring plan for the unit.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2.4 Dual Span and Range Requirements</HD>

              <P>For most units, the high span value based on the MPC, as determined under section 2.1.2.3 of this appendix will suffice to measure and record NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations (unless span and/or range adjustments must be made in accordance with section 2.1.2.5 of this appendix). In some instances, however, a second (low) span value based on the MEC may be required to ensure accurate measurement of all expected and potential NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations. To determine whether two NO<E T="52">X</E> spans are required, proceed as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) Compare the MEC value(s) determined in section 2.1.2.2 of this appendix to the high full-scale range value determined in section 2.1.2.3 of this appendix. If the MEC values for all fuels (or blends) are ≥20.0 percent of the high range value, the high span and range values determined under section 2.1.2.3 of this appendix are sufficient, irrespective of which fuel or blend is combusted in the unit. If any of the MEC values is &lt;20.0 percent of the high range value, two spans (low and high) are required, one based on the MPC and the other based on the MEC.</P>
              <P>(b) When two NO<E T="52">X</E> spans are required, the owner or operator may either use a single NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer with a dual range (low-and high-scales) or two separate NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzers connected to a common sample probe and sample interface. Two separate NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzers connected to separate probes and sample interfaces may be used if RATAs are passed on both ranges. For units with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls (e.g., steam injection, water injection, SCR, or SNCR) or units equipped with dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> technology, the owner or operator may use a low range analyzer and a “default high range value,” as described in paragraph 2.1.2.4(e) of this section, in lieu of maintaining and quality assuring a high-scale range. Other monitor configurations are subject to the approval of the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(c) The owner or operator shall designate the monitoring systems and components in the monitoring plan under § 75.53 as follows: when a single probe and sample interface are used, either designate the low and high ranges as separate NO<E T="52">X</E> components of a single, primary NO<E T="52">X</E> monitoring system; designate the low and high ranges as the NO<E T="52">X</E> components of two separate, primary NO<E T="52">X</E> monitoring systems; designate the normal range as a primary monitoring system and the other range as a non-redundant backup monitoring system; or, when a single, dual-range NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer is used, designate the low and high ranges as a single NO<E T="52">X</E> component of a primary NO<E T="52">X</E> monitoring system (if this option is selected, use a special dual-range component type code, as specified by the Administrator, to satisfy the requirements of § 75.53(e)(1)(iv)(D)). When two NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzers are connected to separate probes and sample interfaces, designate the analyzers as the NO<E T="52">X</E> components of two separate, primary NO<E T="52">X</E> monitoring systems. For units with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> controls or units equipped with dry low-NO<E T="52">X</E> technology, if the default high range value is used, designate the low range analyzer as the NO<E T="52">X</E> component of the primary NO<E T="52">X</E> monitoring system. Do not designate the default high range as a monitoring system or component. Other <PRTPAGE P="364"/>component and system designations are subject to approval by the Administrator. Note that the component and system designations for redundant backup monitoring systems shall be the same as for primary monitoring systems.</P>

              <P>(d) Each monitoring system designated as primary or redundant backup shall meet the initial certification and quality assurance requirements in § 75.20(c) (for primary monitoring systems), in § 75.20(d)(1) (for redundant backup monitoring systems) and appendices A and B to this part, with one exception: relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) are required only on the normal range (for dual span units with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls, the low range is considered normal). Each monitoring system designated as non-redundant backup shall meet the applicable quality assurance requirements in § 75.20(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(e) For dual span units with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls (e.g., steam injection, water injection, SCR, or SNCR), or, for units that use dry low NO<E T="52">X</E> technology, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to maintaining and quality assuring a high monitor range, use a default high range value. If this option is chosen, the owner or operator shall report a default value of 200.0 percent of the MPC for each unit operating hour in which the full-scale of the low range NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer is exceeded.</P>

              <P>(f) The high span and range shall be determined in accordance with section 2.1.2.3 of this appendix. The low span value shall be 100.0 to 125.0 percent of the MEC, rounded up to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm (or 100 ppm, if appropriate). If more than one MEC value (as determined in section 2.1.2.2 of this appendix) is &lt;20.0 percent of the high full-scale range value, the low span value shall be based upon whichever MEC value is closest to 20.0 percent of the high range value. The low range must be greater than or equal to the low span value, and the required calibration gases for the low range must be selected based on the low span value. However, if the default high range option in paragraph (e) of this section is selected, the full-scale of the low measurement range shall not exceed five times the MEC value (where the MEC is rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm). For units with two NO<E T="52">X</E> spans, use the low range whenever NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations are expected to be consistently &lt;20.0 percent of the high range value, i.e., when the MEC of the fuel being combusted is &lt;20.0 percent of the high range value. When the full-scale of the low range is exceeded, the high range shall be used to measure and record the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations; or, if applicable, the default high range value in paragraph (e) of this section shall be reported for each hour of the full-scale exceedance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2.5 Adjustment of Span and Range</HD>

              <P>For each affected unit or common stack, the owner or operator shall make a periodic evaluation of the MPC, MEC, span, and range values for each NO<E T="52">X</E> monitor (at a minimum, an annual evaluation is required) and shall make any necessary span and range adjustments, with corresponding monitoring plan updates, as described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Span and range adjustments may be required, for example, as a result of changes in the fuel supply, changes in the manner of operation of the unit, or installation or removal of emission controls. In implementing the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, note that NO<E T="52">X</E> data recorded during short-term, non-representative operating conditions (e.g., a trial burn of a different type of fuel) shall be excluded from consideration. The owner or operator shall keep the results of the most recent span and range evaluation on-site, in a format suitable for inspection. Make each required span or range adjustment no later than 45 days after the end of the quarter in which the need to adjust the span or range is identified, except that up to 90 days after the end of that quarter may be taken to implement a span adjustment if the calibration gases currently being used for daily calibration error tests and linearity checks are unsuitable for use with the new span value.</P>

              <P>(a) If the fuel supply, emission controls, or other process parameters change such that the maximum expected concentration or the maximum potential concentration changes significantly, adjust the NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration span(s) and (if necessary) monitor range(s) to assure the continued accuracy of the monitoring system. A “significant” change in the MPC or MEC means that the guidelines in section 2.1 of this appendix can no longer be met, as determined by either a periodic evaluation by the owner or operator or from the results of an audit by the Administrator. The owner or operator should evaluate whether any planned changes in operation of the unit or stack may affect the concentration of emissions being emitted from the unit and should plan any necessary span and range changes needed to account for these changes, so that they are made in as timely a manner as practicable to coordinate with the operational changes. An example of a change that may require a span and range adjustment is the installation of low-NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology on a previously uncontrolled unit. Determine the adjusted span(s) using the procedures in section 2.1.2.3 or 2.1.2.4 of this appendix (as applicable). Select the full-scale range(s) of the instrument to be greater than or equal to the adjusted span value(s) and to be consistent with the guidelines of section 2.1 of this appendix.</P>

              <P>(b) Whenever a full-scale range is exceeded during a quarter and the exceedance is not <PRTPAGE P="365"/>caused by a monitor out-of-control period, proceed as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) For exceedances of the high range, report 200.0 percent of the current full-scale range as the hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration for each hour of the full-scale exceedance and make appropriate adjustments to the MPC, span, and range to prevent future full-scale exceedances.</P>
              <P>(2) For units with two NO<E T="52">X</E> spans and ranges, if the low range is exceeded, no further action is required, provided that the high range is available and its most recent calibration error test and linearity check have not expired. However, if either of these quality assurance tests has expired and the high range is not able to provide quality assured data at the time of the low range exceedance or at any time during the continuation of the exceedance, report the MPC as the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration until the readings return to the low range or until the high range is able to provide quality assured data (unless the reason that the high-scale range is not able to provide quality assured data is because the high-scale range has been exceeded; if the high-scale range is exceeded, follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section).</P>

              <P>(c) Whenever changes are made to the MPC, MEC, full-scale range, or span value of the NO<E T="52">X</E> monitor as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, record and report (as applicable) the new full-scale range setting, the new MPC or MEC, maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, and the adjusted span value in an updated monitoring plan for the unit. The monitoring plan update shall be made in the quarter in which the changes become effective. In addition, record and report the adjusted span as part of the records for the daily calibration error test and linearity check required by appendix B to this part. Whenever the span value is adjusted, use calibration gas concentrations that meet the requirements of section 5.1 of this appendix, based on the adjusted span value. When a span adjustment is significant enough that the calibration gases currently being used for daily calibration error tests and linearity checks are unsuitable for use with the new span value, a diagnostic linearity test using the new calibration gases must be performed and passed. Use the data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3), beginning with the hour in which the span is changed.</P>

Convert the MPV, as determined in section 2.1.4.1 of this appendix, to the same measurement units of flow rate that are used for daily calibration error tests (e.g., scfh, kscfh, kacfm, or differential pressure (inches of water)). Next, determine the “calibration span value” by multiplying the MPV (converted to equivalent daily calibration error units) by a factor no less than 1.00 <PRTPAGE P="367"/>and no greater than 1.25, and rounding up the result to at least two significant figures. For calibration span values in inches of water, retain at least two decimal places. Select appropriate reference signals for the daily calibration error tests as percentages of the calibration span value, as specified in section 2.2.2.1 of this appendix. Finally, calculate the “flow rate span value” (in scfh) as the product of the MPF, as determined in section 2.1.4.1 of this appendix, times the same factor (between 1.00 and 1.25) that was used to calculate the calibration span value. Round off the flow rate span value to the nearest 1000 scfh.

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.2 Linearity Check (General Procedures)</HD>
              <P>Check the linearity of each SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and O<E T="52">2</E> monitor while the unit, or group of units for a common stack, is combusting fuel at conditions of typical stack temperature and pressure; it is not necessary for the unit to be generating electricity during this test. Notwithstanding these requirements, if the <PRTPAGE P="373"/>SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> span value for a particular monitor range is ≤30 ppm, that range is exempted from the linearity check requirements of this part, for initial certification, recertification, and for on-going quality-assurance. For units with two measurement ranges (high and low) for a particular parameter, perform a linearity check on both the low scale (except for SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> span values ≤30 ppm) and the high scale. Note that for a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring system with two NO<E T="52">X</E> measurement ranges, if the low NO<E T="52">X</E> scale has a span value ≤30 ppm and is exempt from linearity checks, this does not exempt either the diluent monitor or the high NO<E T="52">X</E> scale (if the span is &gt;30 ppm) from linearity check requirements. For on-going quality assurance of the CEMS, perform linearity checks, using the procedures in this section, on the range(s) and at the frequency specified in section 2.2.1 of appendix B to this part. Challenge each monitor with calibration gas, as defined in section 5.1 of this appendix, at the low-, mid-, and high-range concentrations specified in section 5.2 of this appendix. Introduce the calibration gas at the gas injection port, as specified in section 2.2.1 of this appendix. Operate each monitor at its normal operating temperature and conditions. For extractive and dilution type monitors, pass the calibration gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling and through as much of the sampling probe as is practical. For in-situ type monitors, perform calibration checking all active electronic and optical components, including the transmitter, receiver, and analyzer. Challenge the monitor three times with each reference gas (see example data sheet in Figure 1). Do not use the same gas twice in succession. To the extent practicable, the duration of each linearity test, from the hour of the first injection to the hour of the last injection, shall not exceed 24 unit operating hours. Record the monitor response from the data acquisition and handling system. For each concentration, use the average of the responses to determine the error in linearity using Equation A-4 in this appendix. Linearity checks are acceptable for monitor or monitoring system certification, recertification, or quality assurance if none of the test results exceed the applicable performance specifications in section 3.2 of this appendix. The status of emission data from a CEMS prior to and during a linearity test period shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) For the initial certification of a CEMS, data from the monitoring system are considered invalid until all certification tests, including the linearity test, have been successfully completed, unless the conditional data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are used. When the procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are followed, the words “initial certification” apply instead of “recertification,” and complete all of the initial certification tests by the applicable deadline in § 75.4, rather than within the time periods specified in § 75.20(b)(3)(iv) for the individual tests.</P>
              <P>(b) For the routine quality assurance linearity checks required by section 2.2.1 of appendix B to this part, use the data validation procedures in section 2.2.3 of appendix B to this part.</P>
              <P>(c) When a linearity test is required as a diagnostic test or for recertification, use the data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(d) For linearity tests of non-redundant backup monitoring systems, use the data validation procedures in § 75.20(d)(2)(iii).</P>
              <P>(e) For linearity tests performed during a grace period and after the expiration of a grace period, use the data validation procedures in sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, respectively, of appendix B to this part.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6.3.1 Gas Monitor 7-Day Calibration Error Test</HD>

              <P>The following monitors and ranges are exempted from the 7-day calibration error test requirements of this part: the SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> monitors installed on peaking units (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter); and any SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> measurement range with a span value of 50 ppm or less. In all other cases, measure the calibration error of each SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor, each NO<E T="52">X</E> monitor, and each CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> monitor while the unit is combusting fuel (but not necessarily generating electricity) once each day for 7 consecutive operating days according to the following procedures. (In the event that unit outages occur after the commencement of the test, the 7 consecutive unit operating days need not be 7 consecutive calendar days). Units using dual span monitors must perform the calibration error test on both high- and low-scales of the pollutant concentration monitor. The calibration error test procedures in this section and in section 6.3.2 of this appendix shall also be used to perform the daily assessments and additional calibration error tests required under sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part. Do not make manual or automatic adjustments to the monitor settings until after taking measurements at both zero and high concentration levels for that day during the 7-day test. If automatic adjustments are made following both injections, conduct the calibration error test such that the magnitude of the adjustments can be determined and recorded. Record and report test results for each day using the unadjusted concentration measured in the calibration error test prior to making any <PRTPAGE P="374"/>manual or automatic adjustments (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> resetting the calibration). The calibration error tests should be approximately 24 hours apart, (unless the 7-day test is performed over nonconsecutive days). Perform calibration error tests at both the zero-level concentration and high-level concentration, as specified in section 5.2 of this appendix. Alternatively, a mid-level concentration gas (50.0 to 60.0 percent of the span value) may be used in lieu of the high-level gas, provided that the mid-level gas is more representative of the actual stack gas concentrations. A calibration gas blend may be used as both a zero-level gas and an upscale (mid- or high-level) gas, where appropriate. In addition, repeat the procedure for SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitors using the low-scale for units equipped with emission controls or other units with dual span monitors. Use only calibration gas, as specified in section 5.1 of this appendix. Introduce the calibration gas at the gas injection port, as specified in section 2.2.1 of this appendix. Operate each monitor in its normal sampling mode. For extractive and dilution type monitors, pass the calibration gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling and through as much of the sampling probe as is practical. For in-situ type monitors, perform calibration, checking all active electronic and optical components, including the transmitter, receiver, and analyzer. Challenge the pollutant concentration monitors and CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> monitors once with each calibration gas. Record the monitor response from the data acquisition and handling system. Using Equation A-5 of this appendix, determine the calibration error at each concentration once each day (at approximately 24-hour intervals) for 7 consecutive days according to the procedures given in this section. The results of a 7-day calibration error test are acceptable for monitor or monitoring system certification, recertification or diagnostic testing if none of these daily calibration error test results exceed the applicable performance specifications in section 3.1 of this appendix. The status of emission data from a gas monitor prior to and during a 7-day calibration error test period shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) For initial certification, data from the monitor are considered invalid until all certification tests, including the 7-day calibration error test, have been successfully completed, unless the conditional data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are used. When the procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are followed, the words “initial certification” apply instead of “recertification,” and complete all of the initial certification tests by the applicable deadline in § 75.4, rather than within the time periods specified in § 75.20(b)(3)(iv) for the individual tests.</P>
              <P>(b) When a 7-day calibration error test is required as a diagnostic test or for recertification, use the data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6.3.2 Flow Monitor 7-day Calibration Error Test</HD>
              <P>Flow monitors installed on peaking units (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) are exempted from the 7-day calibration error test requirements of this part. In all other cases, perform the 7-day calibration error test of a flow monitor, when required for certification, recertification or diagnostic testing, according to the following procedures. Introduce the reference signal corresponding to the values specified in section 2.2.2.1 of this appendix to the probe tip (or equivalent), or to the transducer. During the 7-day certification test period, conduct the calibration error test while the unit is operating once each unit operating day (as close to 24-hour intervals as practicable). In the event that unit outages occur after the commencement of the test, the 7 consecutive operating days need not be 7 consecutive calendar days. Record the flow monitor responses by means of the data acquisition and handling system. Calculate the calibration error using Equation A-6 of this appendix. Do not perform any corrective maintenance, repair, or replacement upon the flow monitor during the 7-day test period other than that required in the quality assurance/quality control plan required by appendix B to this part. Do not make adjustments between the zero and high reference level measurements on any day during the 7-day test. If the flow monitor operates within the calibration error performance specification (i.e., less than or equal to 3.0 percent error each day and requiring no corrective maintenance, repair, or replacement during the 7-day test period), the flow monitor passes the calibration error test. Record all maintenance activities and the magnitude of any adjustments. Record output readings from the data acquisition and handling system before and after all adjustments. Record and report all calibration error test results using the unadjusted flow rate measured in the calibration error test prior to resetting the calibration. Record all adjustments made during the 7-day period at the time the adjustment is made, and report them in the certification or recertification application. The status of emissions data from a flow monitor prior to and during a 7-day calibration error test period shall be determined as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) For initial certification, data from the monitor are considered invalid until all certification tests, including the 7-day calibration error test, have been successfully completed, unless the conditional data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are used. When the procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are followed, <PRTPAGE P="375"/>the words “initial certification” apply instead of “recertification,” and complete all of the initial certification tests by the applicable deadline in § 75.4, rather than within the time periods specified in § 75.20(b)(3)(iv) for the individual tests.</P>
              <P>(b) When a 7-day calibration error test is required as a diagnostic test or for recertification, use the data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3).</P>
              <P>6.3.3 For gas or flow monitors installed on peaking units, the exemption from performing the 7-day calibration error test applies as long as the unit continues to meet the definition of a peaking unit in § 72.2 of this chapter. However, if at the end of a particular calendar year or ozone season, it is determined that peaking unit status has been lost, the owner or operator shall perform a diagnostic 7-day calibration error test of each monitor installed on the unit, by no later than December 31 of the following calendar year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.4 Cycle Time Test</HD>

              <P>Perform cycle time tests for each pollutant concentration monitor and continuous emission monitoring system while the unit is operating, according to the following procedures. Use a zero-level and a high-level calibration gas (as defined in section 5.2 of this appendix) alternately. To determine the downscale cycle time, measure the concentration of the flue gas emissions until the response stabilizes. Record the stable emissions value. Inject a zero-level concentration calibration gas into the probe tip (or injection port leading to the calibration cell, for in situ systems with no probe). Record the time of the zero gas injection, using the data acquisition and handling system (DAHS). Next, allow the monitor to measure the concentration of the zero gas until the response stabilizes. Record the stable ending calibration gas reading. Determine the downscale cycle time as the time it takes for 95.0 percent of the step change to be achieved between the stable stack emissions value and the stable ending zero gas reading. Then repeat the procedure, starting with stable stack emissions and injecting the high-level gas, to determine the upscale cycle time, which is the time it takes for 95.0 percent of the step change to be achieved between the stable stack emissions value and the stable ending high-level gas reading. Use the following criteria to assess when a stable reading of stack emissions or calibration gas concentration has been attained. A stable value is equivalent to a reading with a change of less than 2.0 percent of the span value for 2 minutes, or a reading with a change of less than 6.0 percent from the measured average concentration over 6 minutes. Alternatively, the reading is considered stable if it changes by no more than 0.5 ppm or 0.2% CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> (as applicable) for two minutes. (Owners or operators of systems which do not record data in 1-minute or 3-minute intervals may petition the Administrator under § 75.66 for alternative stabilization criteria). For monitors or monitoring systems that perform a series of operations (such as purge, sample, and analyze), time the injections of the calibration gases so they will produce the longest possible cycle time. Refer to Figures 6a and 6b in this appendix for example calculations of upscale and downscale cycle times. Report the slower of the two cycle times (upscale or downscale) as the cycle time for the analyzer. Prior to January 1, 2009 for the NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system test, either record and report the longer cycle time of the two component analyzers as the system cycle time or record the cycle time for each component analyzer separately (as applicable). On and after January 1, 2009, record the cycle time for each component analyzer separately. For time-shared systems, perform the cycle time tests at each probe locations that will be polled within the same 15-minute period during monitoring system operations. To determine the cycle time for time-shared systems, at each monitoring location, report the sum of the cycle time observed at that monitoring location plus the sum of the time required for all purge cycles (as determined by the continuous emission monitoring system manufacturer) at each of the probe locations of the time-shared systems. For monitors with dual ranges, report the test results for each range separately. Cycle time test results are acceptable for monitor or monitoring system certification, recertification or diagnostic testing if none of the cycle times exceed 15 minutes. The status of emissions data from a monitor prior to and during a cycle time test period shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) For initial certification, data from the monitor are considered invalid until all certification tests, including the cycle time test, have been successfully completed, unless the conditional data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are used. When the procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are followed, the words “initial certification” apply instead of “recertification,” and complete all of the initial certification tests by the applicable deadline in § 75.4, rather than within the time periods specified in § 75.20(b)(3)(iv) for the individual tests.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.5 Relative Accuracy and Bias Tests (General Procedures)</HD>

              <P>Perform the required relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) as follows for each CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions concentration monitor (including O<E T="52">2</E> monitors used to determine CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions <PRTPAGE P="376"/>concentration), each SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor, each NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system used to determine NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions, each flow monitor, each NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS, each O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E> diluent monitor used to calculate heat input, and each moisture monitoring system. For NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring systems used to determine NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions, as defined in § 75.71(a)(2), use the same general RATA procedures as for SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitors; however, use the reference methods for NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration specified in section 6.5.10 of this appendix:</P>

              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or in § 75.21(a)(5), perform each RATA while the unit (or units, if more than one unit exhausts into the flue) is combusting the fuel that is a normal primary or backup fuel for that unit (for some units, more than one type of fuel may be considered normal, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, a unit that combusts gas or oil on a seasonal basis). For units that co-fire fuels as the predominant mode of operation, perform the RATAs while co-firing. For Hg monitoring systems, perform the RATAs while the unit is combusting coal. When relative accuracy test audits are performed on CEMS installed on bypass stacks/ducts, use the fuel normally combusted by the unit (or units, if more than one unit exhausts into the flue) when emissions exhaust through the bypass stack/ducts.</P>
              <P>(b) Perform each RATA at the load (or operating) level(s) specified in section 6.5.1 or 6.5.2 of this appendix or in section 2.3.1.3 of appendix B to this part, as applicable.</P>

              <P>(c) For monitoring systems with dual ranges, perform the relative accuracy test on the range normally used for measuring emissions. For units with add-on SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> controls that operate continuously rather than seasonally, or for units that need a dual range to record high concentration “spikes” during startup conditions, the low range is considered normal. However, for some dual span units (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> for units that use fuel switching or for which the emission controls are operated seasonally), provided that both monitor ranges are connected to a common probe and sample interface, either of the two measurement ranges may be considered normal; in such cases, perform the RATA on the range that is in use at the time of the scheduled test. If the low and high measurement ranges are connected to separate sample probes and interfaces, RATA testing on both ranges is required.</P>

For 2-level and 3-level flow monitor RATAs, complete all of the RATAs at all levels, to the extent practicable, within a period of 168 consecutive unit (or stack) operating hours; however, if this is not possible, up to 720 consecutive unit (or stack) operating hours may be taken to complete a multiple-load flow RATA.</P>
              <P>(f) The status of emission data from the CEMS prior to and during the RATA test period shall be determined as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, perform relative accuracy test audits for the initial certification of each flow monitor at three different exhaust gas velocities (low, mid, and high), corresponding to three different load levels or operating levels within the range of operation, as defined in section 6.5.2.1 of this appendix. For a common stack/duct, the three different exhaust gas velocities may be obtained from frequently used unit/load or operating level combinations for the units exhausting to the common stack. Select the three exhaust gas velocities such that the audit points at adjacent load or operating levels (i.e., low and mid or mid and high), in megawatts (or in thousands of lb/hr of steam production or in ft/sec, as applicable), are separated by no less than 25.0 percent of the range of operation, as defined in section 6.5.2.1 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(b) For flow monitors on bypass stacks/ducts and peaking units, the flow monitor relative accuracy test audits for initial certification and recertification shall be single-load tests, performed at the normal load, as defined in section 6.5.2.1(d) of this appendix.</P>

              <P>(1) For affected units that produce electrical output (in megawatts) or thermal output (in klb/hr of steam production or mmBtu/hr), the lower boundary of the range of operation of a unit shall be the minimum safe, stable loads for any of the units discharging through the stack. Alternatively, for a group of frequently-operated units that serve a common stack, the sum of the minimum safe, stable loads for the individual units may be used as the lower boundary of the range of operation. The upper boundary of the range of operation of a unit shall be the maximum sustainable load. The “maximum sustainable load” is the higher of either: the nameplate or rated capacity of the unit, less any physical or regulatory limitations or other deratings; or the highest sustainable load, based on at least four quarters of representative historical operating data. For common stacks, the maximum sustainable load is the sum of all of the maximum sustainable loads of the individual units discharging through the stack, unless this load is unattainable in practice, in which case use the highest sustainable combined load for the units that discharge through the stack. Based on at least four quarters of representative historical operating data.

              <P>(2) For affected units that do not produce electrical or thermal output, the lower boundary of the range of operation shall be the minimum expected flue gas velocity (in ft/sec) during normal, stable operation of the unit. The upper boundary of the range of operation shall be the maximum potential flue gas velocity (in ft/sec) as defined in section 2.1.4.1 of this appendix. The minimum expected and maximum potential velocities may be derived from the results of reference method testing or by using Equation A-3a or A-3b (as applicable) in section 2.1.4.1 of this appendix. If Equation A-3a or A-3b is used to determine the minimum expected velocity, replace the word “maximum” with the word <PRTPAGE P="378"/>“minimum” in the definitions of “MPV,” “H<E T="52">f</E>,” “% O<E T="52">2d</E>,” and “% H<E T="52">2</E>O,” and replace the word “minimum” with the word “maximum” in the definition of “CO<E T="52">2d</E>.” Alternatively, 0.0 ft/sec may be used as the lower boundary of the range of operation.</P>
              <P>(b) The operating levels for relative accuracy test audits shall, except for peaking units, be defined as follows: the “low” operating level shall be the first 30.0 percent of the range of operation; the “mid” operating level shall be the middle portion (&gt;30.0 percent, but ≤60.0 percent) of the range of operation; and the “high” operating level shall be the upper end (&gt;60.0 percent) of the range of operation.

To identify the normal load level(s), the owner or operator shall, at a minimum, determine the relative number of operating hours at each of the three load levels, low, mid and high over the past four representative operating quarters.

For new units or newly-affected units, the data analysis in this paragraph may be based on fewer than four quarters of data if fewer than four representative quarters of historical load data are available. Or, if no historical load data are available, the owner or operator may designate the normal load based on the expected or projected manner of operating the unit.

              <P>(1) Based on the analysis of the historical load data described in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall, for units that produce electrical or thermal output, designate the most frequently used load level as the normal load level for the unit (or combination of units, for common stacks). The owner or operator may also designate the second most frequently used load level as an additional normal load level for the unit or stack. For peaking units and LME units, normal load designations are unnecessary; the entire operating load range shall be considered normal.

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6.5.7 Sampling Strategy</HD>

              <P>(a) Conduct the reference method tests allowed in section 6.5.10 of this appendix so they will yield results representative of the pollutant concentration, emission rate, moisture, temperature, and flue gas flow rate from the unit and can be correlated with the pollutant concentration monitor, CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> monitor, flow monitor, and SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMS measurements. The minimum acceptable time for a gas monitoring system RATA run or for a moisture monitoring system RATA run is 21 minutes. For each run of a gas monitoring system RATA, all necessary pollutant concentration measurements, diluent concentration measurements, and moisture measurements (if applicable) must, to the extent practicable, be made within a 60-minute period. For NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring system RATAs, the pollutant and diluent concentration measurements must be made simultaneously. For flow monitor RATAs, the minimum time per run shall be 5 minutes. Flow rate reference method measurements allowed in section 6.5.10 of this appendix may be made either sequentially from port-to-port or simultaneously at <PRTPAGE P="381"/>two or more sample ports. The velocity measurement probe may be moved from traverse point to traverse point either manually or automatically. If, during a flow RATA, significant pulsations in the reference method readings are observed, be sure to allow enough measurement time at each traverse point to obtain an accurate average reading when a manual readout method is used (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a “sight-weighted” average from a manometer). Also, allow sufficient measurement time to ensure that stable temperature readings are obtained at each traverse point, particularly at the first measurement point at each sample port, when a probe is moved sequentially from port-to-port. A minimum of one set of auxiliary measurements for stack gas molecular weight determination (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> diluent gas data and moisture data) is required for every clock hour of a flow RATA or for every three test runs (whichever is less restrictive). Alternatively, moisture measurements for molecular weight determination may be performed before and after a series of flow RATA runs at a particular load level (low, mid, or high), provided that the time interval between the two moisture measurements does not exceed three hours. If this option is selected, the results of the two moisture determinations shall be averaged arithmetically and applied to all RATA runs in the series. Successive flow RATA runs may be performed without waiting in between runs. If an O<E T="52">2</E> diluent monitor is used as a CO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system, perform a CO<E T="52">2</E> system RATA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> measure CO<E T="52">2</E>, rather than O<E T="52">2</E>, with the applicable reference method allowed in section 6.5.10 of this appendix). For moisture monitoring systems, an appropriate coefficient, “K” factor or other suitable mathematical algorithm may be developed prior to the RATA, to adjust the monitoring system readings with respect to the applicable reference method allowed in section 6.5.10 of this appendix. If such a coefficient, K-factor or algorithm is developed, it shall be applied to the CEMS readings during the RATA and (if the RATA is passed), to the subsequent CEMS data, by means of the automated data acquisition and handling system. The owner or operator shall keep records of the current coefficient, K factor or algorithm, as specified in § 75.59(a)(5)(vii). Whenever the coefficient, K factor or algorithm is changed, a RATA of the moisture monitoring system is required.</P>
              <P>(b) To properly correlate individual SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMS data (in lb/mmBtu) and volumetric flow rate data with the applicable reference method data, annotate the beginning and end of each reference method test run (including the exact time of day) on the individual chart recorder(s) or other permanent recording device(s).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">6.5.8 Correlation of Reference Method and Continuous Emission Monitoring System</HD>
              <P>Confirm that the monitor or monitoring system and reference method test results are on consistent moisture, pressure, temperature, and diluent concentration basis (e.g., since the flow monitor measures flow rate on a wet basis, method 2 test results must also be on a wet basis). Compare flow-monitor and reference method results on a scfh basis. Also, consider the response times of the pollutant concentration monitor, the continuous emission monitoring system, and the flow monitoring system to ensure comparison of simultaneous measurements.</P>

              <P>For each relative accuracy test audit run, compare the measurements obtained from the monitor or continuous emission monitoring system (in ppm, percent CO<E T="52">2</E>, lb/mmBtu, or other units) against the corresponding reference method values. Tabulate the paired data in a table such as the one shown in Figure 2.</P>

For 2-level and 3-level relative accuracy test audits of flow monitors, perform a minimum of nine sets at each of the operating levels.

When using Method 7E for measuring NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration, total NO<E T="52">X</E>, including both NO and NO<E T="52">2</E>, must be measured. When using EPA Protocol gas with Methods 3A, 6C, and 7E, the gas must be from an EPA Protocol gas production site that is participating in the EPA Protocol Gas Verification Program, pursuant to § 75.21(g)(6). An EPA Protocol gas cylinder certified by or ordered from a non-participating production site no later than May 27, 2011 may be used for the purposes of this part until the earlier of the cylinder's expiration date or the date on which the cylinder gas pressure reaches 150 psig; however, in no case shall the cylinder be recertified by a non-participating EPA Protocol gas production site to extend its useful life and be used by a source subject to this part. In the event that an EPA Protocol gas production site is removed from the list of PGVP participants on the same date as or after the date on which a particular cylinder is certified or ordered, that gas cylinder may continue to be used for the purposes of this part until the earlier of the cylinder's expiration date or the date on which the cylinder gas pressure reaches 150 psig; however, in no case shall the cylinder be recertified by a non-participating EPA Protocol gas production site to extend its useful life and be used by a source subject to this part.</P>

              <P>(b) For single-load RATAs of SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitors, NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring systems, and NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring systems, and for the single-load flow RATAs required or allowed under section 6.5.2 of this appendix and sections 2.3.1.3(b) and 2.3.1.3(c) of appendix B to this part, the appropriate BAF is determined directly from the RATA results at normal load, using Equation A-12. Notwithstanding, when a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration CEMS or an SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS or a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS installed on a low-emitting affected unit (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> average SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration during the RATA ≤250 ppm or average NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate ≤0.200 lb/mmBtu) meets the normal 10.0 percent relative accuracy specification (as calculated using Equation A-10) or the alternate relative accuracy specification in section 3.3 of this appendix for low-emitters, but fails the bias test, the BAF may either be determined using Equation A-12, or a default BAF of 1.111 may be used.</P>
              <P>(c) For 2-load or 3-load flow RATAs, when only one load level (low, mid or high) has been designated as normal under section 6.5.2.1 of this appendix and the bias test is passed at the normal load level, apply a BAF of 1.000 to the subsequent flow rate data. If the bias test is failed at the normal load level, use Equation A-12 to calculate the normal load BAF and then perform an additional bias test at the second most frequently-used load level, as determined under section 6.5.2.1 of this appendix. If the bias test is passed at this second load level, apply the normal load BAF to the subsequent flow rate data. If the bias test is failed at this second load level, use Equation A-12 to calculate the BAF at the second load level and apply the higher of the two BAFs (either from the normal load level or from the second load level) to the subsequent flow rate data.</P>
              <P>(d) For 2-load or 3-load flow RATAs, when two load levels have been designated as normal under section 6.5.2.1 of this appendix and the bias test is passed at both normal load levels, apply a BAF of 1.000 to the subsequent flow rate data. If the bias test is failed at one of the normal load levels but not at the other, use Equation A-12 to calculate the BAF for the normal load level at which the bias test was failed and apply that BAF to the subsequent flow rate data. If the bias test is failed at both designated normal load levels, use Equation A-12 to calculate the BAF at each normal load level and apply the higher of the two BAFs to the subsequent flow rate data.</P>
              <P>(e) Each time a RATA is passed and the appropriate bias adjustment factor has been determined, apply the BAF prospectively to all monitoring system data, beginning with the first clock hour following the hour in which the RATA was completed. For a 2-load flow RATA, the “hour in which the RATA was completed” refers to the hour in which the testing at both loads was completed; for a 3-load RATA, it refers to the hour in which the testing at all three loads was completed.</P>

              <P>(f) Use the bias-adjusted values in computing substitution values in the missing data procedure, as specified in subpart D of this part, and in reporting the concentration of SO<E T="52">2</E>, the flow rate, the average NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, the unit heat input, and the calculated mass emissions of SO<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> during the quarter and calendar year, as specified in subpart G of this part. In addition, when using a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system and a flow monitor to calculate NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions under subpart H of this part, use bias-adjusted values for NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration and flow rate in the mass emission calculations and use bias-adjusted NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations to compute the appropriate substitution values for NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration in the missing data routines under subpart D of this part.</P>

In the latter case, calculate the value of Q<E T="52">ref</E> for each stack by taking the arithmetic average, for all RATA runs, of the flow rates through the stack. For a unit with a multiple stack discharge configuration consisting of a main stack and a bypass stack (e.g., a unit with a wet SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber), determine Q<E T="52">ref</E> separately for each stack at the time of the normal load flow RATA.

              <P>(a) For complex stack configuations (e.g., when the effluent from a unit is divided and discharges through multiple stacks in such a manner that the flow rate in the individual stacks cannot be correlated with unit load), the owner or operator may petition the Administrator under § 75.66 for an exemption from the requirements of section 7.7 of this appendix and section 2.2.5 fo appendix B to this part. The petition must include sufficient information and data to demonstrate that a flow-to-load or gross heat rate evaluation is infeasible for the complex stack configuration.</P>

              <P>(b) Units that do not produce electrical output (in megawatts) or thermal output (in klb of steam per hour) are exempted from the flow-to-load ratio test requirements of section 7.7 of this appendix and section 2.2.5 of appendix B to this part.<PRTPAGE P="387"/>

              <P>
                <E T="03">2.1.1.2 Off-line Daily Calibration Error Tests.</E> Daily calibrations may be performed while the unit is not operating (i.e., “off-line”) and may be used to validate data for a monitoring system that meets the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) An initial demonstration test of the monitoring system is successfully completed and the results are reported in the quarterly report required under § 75.64 of this part. The initial demonstration test, hereafter called the “off-line calibration demonstration”, consists of an off-line calibration error test followed by an on-line calibration error test. Both the off-line and on-line portions of the off-line calibration demonstration must meet the calibration error performance specification in section 3.1 of appendix A of this part. Upon completion of the off-line portion of the demonstration, the zero and upscale monitor responses may be adjusted, but only toward the true values of the calibration gases or reference signals used to perform the test and only in accordance with the routine calibration adjustment procedures specified in the quality control program required under section 1 of appendix B to this part. Once these adjustments are made, no further adjustments may be made to the monitoring system until after completion of the on-line portion of the off-line calibration demonstration. Within 26 clock hours of the completion hour of the off-line portion of the demonstration, the monitoring system must successfully complete the first attempted calibration error test, i.e., the on-line portion of the demonstration.</P>
              <P>(2) For each monitoring system that has passed the off-line calibration demonstration, off-line calibration error tests may be used on a limited basis to validate data, in accordance with paragraph (2) in section 2.1.5.1 of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2 Daily Flow Interference Check</HD>
              <P>Perform the daily flow monitor interference checks specified in section 2.2.2.2 of appendix A of this part while the unit is in operation at normal, stable conditions.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.3 Additional Calibration Error Tests and Calibration Adjustments</HD>
              <P>(a) In addition to the daily calibration error tests required under section 2.1.1 of this appendix, a calibration error test of a monitor shall be performed in accordance with section 2.1.1 of this appendix, as follows: whenever a daily calibration error test is failed; whenever a monitoring system is returned to service following repair or corrective maintenance that could affect the monitor's ability to accurately measure and record emissions data; or after making certain calibration adjustments, as described in this section. Except in the case of the routine calibration adjustments described in this section, data from the monitor are considered invalid until the required additional calibration error test has been successfully completed.</P>

              <P>(b) Routine calibration adjustments of a monitor are permitted after any successful calibration error test. These routine adjustments shall be made so as to bring the monitor readings as close as practicable to the known tag values of the calibration gases or to the actual value of the flow monitor reference signals. An additional calibration error test is required following routine calibration adjustments where the monitor's calibration has been physically adjusted (e.g., by turning a potentiometer) to verify that the adjustments have been made properly. An additional calibration error test is not required, however, if the routine calibration adjustments are made by means of a mathematical algorithm programmed into the data acquisition and handling system. The EPA recommends that routine calibration adjustments be made, at a minimum, whenever the daily calibration error exceeds the limits of the applicable performance specification in appendix A to this part for the pollutant concentration monitor, CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> monitor, or flow monitor.</P>
              <P>(c) Additional (non-routine) calibration adjustments of a monitor are permitted prior to (but not during) linearity checks and RATAs and at other times, provided that an appropriate technical justification is included in the quality control program required under section 1 of this appendix. The allowable non-routine adjustments are as follows. The owner or operator may physically adjust the calibration of a monitor (e.g., by means of a potentiometer), provided that the post-adjustment zero and upscale responses of the monitor are within the performance specifications of the instrument given in section 3.1 of appendix A to this part. An additional calibration error test is required following such adjustments to verify that the monitor is operating within the performance specifications at both the zero and upscale calibration levels.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.4 Data Validation</HD>

              <P>(a) An out-of-control period occurs when the calibration error of an SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitor exceeds 5.0 percent of the span value, when the calibration error of a CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> monitor (including O<E T="52">2</E> monitors used to measure CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions or percent moisture) exceeds 1.0 percent O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E>, or when the calibration error of a flow monitor exceeds 6.0 percent of the span value, which is twice the applicable specification of appendix A to this part. Notwithstanding, a differential pressure-type flow monitor for which the calibration error exceeds 6.0 percent of the span value shall not <PRTPAGE P="394"/>be considered out-of-control if |R-A|, the absolute value of the difference between the monitor response and the reference value in Equation A-6 of appendix A to this part, is &lt;0.02 inches of water. In addition, an SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> monitor for which the calibration error exceeds 5.0 percent of the span value shall not be considered out-of-control if |R-A| in Equation A-6 does not exceed 5.0 ppm (for span values ≤50 ppm), or if |R-A|; does not exceed 10.0 ppm (for span values &gt;50 ppm, but ≤200 ppm). The out-of-control period begins upon failure of the calibration error test and ends upon completion of a successful calibration error test. Note, that if a failed calibration, corrective action, and successful calibration error test occur within the same hour, emission data for that hour recorded by the monitor after the successful calibration error test may be used for reporting purposes, provided that two or more valid readings are obtained as required by § 75.10. A NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS is considered out-of-control if the calibration error of either component monitor exceeds twice the applicable performance specification in appendix A to this part. Emission data shall not be reported from an out-of-control monitor.</P>
              <P>(b) An out-of-control period also occurs whenever interference of a flow monitor is identified. The out-of-control period begins with the hour of completion of the failed interference check and ends with the hour of completion of an interference check that is passed.</P>
              <P>(c) The results of any certification, recertification, diagnostic, or quality assurance test required under this part may not be used to validate the emissions data required under this part, if the test is performed using EPA Protocol gas from a production site that is not participating in the PGVP, except as provided in § 75.21(g)(7) or if the cylinder(s) are analyzed by an independent laboratory and shown to meet the requirements of section 5.1.4(b) of appendix A to this part.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.5 Quality Assurance of Data With Respect to Daily Assessments</HD>
              <P>When a monitoring system passes a daily assessment (i.e., daily calibration error test or daily flow interference check), data from that monitoring system are prospectively validated for 26 clock hours (i.e., 24 hours plus a 2-hour grace period) beginning with the hour in which the test is passed, unless another assessment (i.e. a daily calibration error test, an interference check of a flow monitor, a quarterly linearity check, a quarterly leak check, or a relative accuracy test audit) is failed within the 26-hour period.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2.1.5.1 Data Invalidation with Respect to Daily Assessments.</E> The following specific rules apply to the invalidation of data with respect to daily assessments:</P>
              <P>(1) Data from a monitoring system are invalid, beginning with the first hour following the expiration of a 26-hour data validation period or beginning with the first hour following the expiration of an 8-hour start-up grace period (as provided under section 2.1.5.2 of this appendix), if the required subsequent daily assessment has not been conducted.</P>
              <P>(2) For a monitor that has passed the off-line calibration demonstration, a combination of on-line and off-line calibration error tests may be used to validate data from the monitor, as follows. For a particular unit (or stack) operating hour, data from a monitor may be validated using a successful off-line calibration error test if: (a) An on-line calibration error test has been passed within the previous 26 unit (or stack) operating hours; and (b) the 26 clock hour data validation window for the off-line calibration error test has not expired. If either of these conditions is not met, then the data from the monitor are invalid with respect to the daily calibration error test requirement. Data from the monitor shall remain invalid until the appropriate on-line or off-line calibration error test is successfully completed so that both conditions (a) and (b) are met.</P>
              <P>(3) For units with two measurement ranges (low and high) for a particular parameter, when separate analyzers are used for the low and high ranges, a failed or expired calibration on one of the ranges does not affect the quality-assured data status on the other range. For a dual-range analyzer (i.e., a single analyzer with two measurement scales), a failed calibration error test on either the low or high scale results in an out-of-control period for the monitor. Data from the monitor remain invalid until corrective actions are taken and “hands-off” calibration error tests have been passed on both ranges. However, if the most recent calibration error test on the high scale was passed but has expired, while the low scale is up-to-date on its calibration error test requirements (or vice-versa), the expired calibration error test does not affect the quality-assured status of the data recorded on the other scale.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">2.1.5.2 Daily Assessment Start-Up Grace Period.</E> For the purpose of quality assuring data with respect to a daily assessment (i.e. a daily calibration error test or a flow interference check), a start-up grace period may apply when a unit begins to operate after a period of non-operation. The start-up grace period for a daily calibration error test is independent of the start-up grace period for a daily flow interference check. To qualify for a start-up grace period for a daily assessment, there are two requirements:</P>

              <P>(1) The unit must have resumed operation after being in outage for 1 or more hours (i.e., the unit must be in a start-up condition) as evidenced by a change in unit operating time from zero in one clock hour to an operating time greater than zero in the next clock hour.<PRTPAGE P="395"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) For the monitoring system to be used to validate data during the grace period, the previous daily assessment of the same kind must have been passed on-line within 26 clock hours prior to the last hour in which the unit operated before the outage. In addition, the monitoring system must be in-control with respect to quarterly and semi-annual or annual assessments.</P>
              <P>If both of the above conditions are met, then a start-up grace period of up to 8 clock hours applies, beginning with the first hour of unit operation following the outage. During the start-up grace period, data generated by the monitoring system are considered quality-assured. For each monitoring system, a start-up grace period for a calibration error test or flow interference check ends when either: (1) a daily assessment of the same kind (i.e., calibration error test or flow interference check) is performed; or (2) 8 clock hours have elapsed (starting with the first hour of unit operation following the outage), whichever occurs first.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.6 Data Recording</HD>
              <P>Record and tabulate all calibration error test data according to month, day, clock-hour, and magnitude in either ppm, percent volume, or scfh. Program monitors that automatically adjust data to the corrected calibration values (e.g., microprocessor control) to record either: (1) The unadjusted concentration or flow rate measured in the calibration error test prior to resetting the calibration, or (2) the magnitude of any adjustment. Record the following applicable flow monitor interference check data: (1) Sample line/sensing port pluggage, and (2) malfunction of each RTD, transceiver, or equivalent.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.2 Quarterly Assessments</HD>
              <P>For each primary and redundant backup monitor or monitoring system, perform the following quarterly assessments.

              <P>Unless a particular monitor (or monitoring range) is exempted under this paragraph or under section 6.2 of appendix A to this part, perform a linearity check, in accordance with the procedures in section 6.2 of appendix A to this part, for each primary and redundant backup SO<E T="52">2</E>, and NOx pollutant concentration monitor and each primary and redundant backup CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> monitor (including O<E T="52">2</E> monitors used to measure CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions or to continuously monitor moisture) at least once during each QA operating quarter, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter. For units using both a low and high span value, a linearity check is required only on the range(s) used to record and report emission data during the QA operating quarter. Conduct the linearity checks no less than 30 days apart, to the extent practicable. The data validation procedures in section 2.2.3(e) of this appendix shall be followed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.2.2 Leak Check</HD>
              <P>For differential pressure flow monitors, perform a leak check of all sample lines (a manual check is acceptable) at least once during each QA operating quarter. For this test, the unit does not have to be in operation. Conduct the leak checks no less than 30 days apart, to the extent practicable. If a leak check is failed, follow the applicable data validation procedures in section 2.2.3(g) of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.2.3 Data Validation</HD>
              <P>(a) A linearity check shall not be commenced if the monitoring system is operating out-of-control with respect to any of the daily or semiannual quality assurance assessments required by sections 2.1 and 2.3 of this appendix or with respect to the additional calibration error test requirements in section 2.1.3 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(b) Each required linearity check shall be done according to paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The linearity check may be done “cold,” i.e., with no corrective maintenance, repair, calibration adjustments, re-linearization or reprogramming of the monitor prior to the test.</P>

              <P>(2) The linearity check may be done after performing only the routine or non-routine calibration adjustments described in section 2.1.3 of this appendix at the various calibration gas levels (zero, low, mid or high), but no other corrective maintenance, repair, re-linearization or reprogramming of the monitor. Trial gas injection runs may be performed after the calibration adjustments and additional adjustments within the allowable limits in section 2.1.3 of this appendix may be made prior to the linearity check, as necessary, to optimize the performance of the monitor. The trial gas injections need not be reported, provided that they meet the specification for trial gas injections in § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(E)(<E T="03">1</E>). However, if, for any trial injection, the specification in § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(E)(<E T="03">1</E>) is not met, the trial injection shall be counted as an aborted linearity check.</P>

              <P>(3) The linearity check may be done after repair, corrective maintenance or reprogramming of the monitor. In this case, the monitor shall be considered out-of-control from the hour in which the repair, corrective maintenance or reprogramming is commenced until the linearity check has <PRTPAGE P="396"/>been passed. Alternatively, the data validation procedures and associated timelines in §§ 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (ix) may be followed upon completion of the necessary repair, corrective maintenance, or reprogramming. If the procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are used, the words “quality assurance” apply instead of the word “recertification”.</P>
              <P>(c) Once a linearity check has been commenced, the test shall be done hands-off. That is, no adjustments of the monitor are permitted during the linearity test period, other than the routine calibration adjustments following daily calibration error tests, as described in section 2.1.3 of this appendix. If a routine daily calibration error test is performed and passed just prior to a linearity test (or during a linearity test period) and a mathematical correction factor is automatically applied by the DAHS, the correction factor shall be applied to all subsequent data recorded by the monitor, including the linearity test data.</P>
              <P>(d) If a daily calibration error test is failed during a linearity test period, prior to completing the test, the linearity test must be repeated. Data from the monitor are invalidated prospectively from the hour of the failed calibration error test until the hour of completion of a subsequent successful calibration error test. The linearity test shall not be commenced until the monitor has successfully completed a calibration error test.</P>

              <P>(e) An out-of-control period occurs when a linearity test is failed (i.e., when the error in linearity at any of the three concentrations in the quarterly linearity check (or any of the six concentrations, when both ranges of a single analyzer with a dual range are tested) exceeds the applicable specification in section 3.2 of appendix A to this part) or when a linearity test is aborted due to a problem with the monitor or monitoring system. For a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system, the system is considered out-of-control if either of the component monitors exceeds the applicable specification in section 3.2 of appendix A to this part or if the linearity test of either component is aborted due to a problem with the monitor. The out-of-control period begins with the hour of the failed or aborted linearity check and ends with the hour of completion of a satisfactory linearity check following corrective action and/or monitor repair, unless the option in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to use the data validation procedures and associated timelines in § 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (ix) has been selected, in which case the beginning and end of the out-of-control period shall be determined in accordance with §§ 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(A) and (B). For a dual-range analyzer, “hands-off” linearity checks must be passed on both measurement scales to end the out-of-control period. Note that a monitor shall not be considered out-of-control when a linearity test is aborted for a reason unrelated to the monitor's performance (e.g., a forced unit outage).</P>
              <P>(f) No more than four successive calendar quarters shall elapse after the quarter in which a linearity check of a monitor or monitoring system (or range of a monitor or monitoring system) was last performed without a subsequent linearity test having been conducted. If a linearity test has not been completed by the end of the fourth calendar quarter since the last linearity test, then the linearity test must be completed within a 168 unit operating hour or stack operating hour “grace period” (as provided in section 2.2.4 of this appendix) following the end of the fourth successive elapsed calendar quarter, or data from the CEMS (or range) will become invalid.</P>
              <P>(g) An out-of-control period also occurs when a flow monitor sample line leak is detected. The out-of-control period begins with the hour of the failed leak check and ends with the hour of a satisfactory leak check following corrective action.</P>
              <P>(h) For each monitoring system, report the results of all completed and partial linearity tests that affect data validation (i.e., all completed, passed linearity checks; all completed, failed linearity checks; and all linearity checks aborted due to a problem with the monitor, including trial gas injections counted as failed test attempts under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or under § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(F)), in the quarterly report required under § 75.64. Note that linearity attempts which are aborted or invalidated due to problems with the reference calibration gases or due to operational problems with the affected unit(s) need not be reported. Such partial tests do not affect the validation status of emission data recorded by the monitor. A record of all linearity tests, trial gas injections and test attempts (whether reported or not) must be kept on-site as part of the official test log for each monitoring system.</P>
              <P>(i) The results of any certification, recertification, diagnostic, or quality assurance test required under this part may not be used to validate the emissions data required under this part, if the test is performed using EPA Protocol gas that was not from an EPA Protocol gas production site participating in the PGVP on the date the gas was procured either by the tester or by a reseller that sold to the tester the unaltered EPA Protocol gas, except as provided in § 75.21(g)(7) or if the cylinder(s) are analyzed by an independent laboratory and shown to meet the requirements of section 5.1.4(b) of appendix A to this part.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.2.4 Linearity and Leak Check Grace Period</HD>

              <P>(a) When a required linearity test or flow monitor leak check has not been completed by the end of the QA operating quarter in <PRTPAGE P="397"/>which it is due or if, due to infrequent operation of a unit or infrequent use of a required high range of a monitor or monitoring system, four successive calendar quarters have elapsed after the quarter in which a linearity check of a monitor or monitoring system (or range) was last performed without a subsequent linearity test having been done, the owner or operator has a grace period of 168 consecutive unit operating hours, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter (or, for monitors installed on common stacks or bypass stacks, 168 consecutive stack operating hours, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) in which to perform a linearity test or leak check of that monitor or monitoring system (or range). The grace period begins with the first unit or stack operating hour following the calendar quarter in which the linearity test was due. Data validation during a linearity or leak check grace period shall be done in accordance with the applicable provisions in section 2.2.3 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(b) If, at the end of the 168 unit (or stack) operating hour grace period, the required linearity test or leak check has not been completed, data from the monitoring system (or range) shall be invalid, beginning with the first unit operating hour following the expiration of the grace period. Data from the monitoring system (or range) remain invalid until the hour of completion of a subsequent successful hands-off linearity test or leak check of the monitor or monitoring system (or range). Note that when a linearity test or a leak check is conducted within a grace period for the purpose of satisfying the linearity test or leak check requirement from a previous QA operating quarter, the results of that linearity test or leak check may only be used to meet the linearity check or leak check requirement of the previous quarter, not the quarter in which the missed linearity test or leak check is completed.</P>

At the end of each QA operating quarter, the owner or operator shall use Equation B-1 to calculate the flow-to-load ratio for every hour during the quarter in which: the unit (or combination of units, for a common stack) operated within ±10.0 percent of L<E T="52">avg</E>, the average load during the most recent normal-load flow RATA; and a quality-assured hourly average flow rate was obtained with a certified flow rate monitor. Alternatively, for the reasons stated in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section, the owner or operator may exclude from the data analysis certain hours within ±10.0 percent of L<E T="52">avg</E> and may calculate R<E T="52">h</E> values for only the remaining hours.</P>

              <P>(1) In Equation B-1, the owner or operator may use either bias-adjusted flow rates or unadjusted flow rates, provided that all of the ratios are calculated the same way. For a common stack, L<E T="52">h</E> shall be the sum of the hourly operating loads of all units that discharge through the stack. For a unit that discharges its emissions through multiple stacks or that monitors its emissions in multiple breechings, Q<E T="52">h</E> will be either the combined hourly volumetric flow rate for all of the stacks or ducts (if the test is done on a unit basis) or the hourly flow rate through each stack individually (if the test is performed separately for each stack). For a unit with a multiple stack discharge configuration consisting of a main stack and a bypass stack, each of which has a certified flow monitor (e.g., a unit with a wet SO<E T="52">2</E> scrubber), calculate the hourly flow-to-load ratios separately for each stack. Round off each value of R<E T="52">h</E> to two decimal places.</P>

              <P>(2) Alternatively, the owner or operator may calculate the hourly gross heat rates (GHR) in lieu of the hourly flow-to-load ratios. The hourly GHR shall be determined only for those hours in which quality-assured flow rate data and diluent gas (CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E>) concentration data are both available <PRTPAGE P="398"/>from a certified monitor or monitoring system or reference method.

              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall evaluate the calculated hourly flow-to-load ratios (or gross heat rates) as follows. A separate data analysis shall be performed for each primary and each redundant backup flow rate monitor used to record and report data during the quarter. Each analysis shall be based on a minimum of 168 acceptable recorded hourly average flow rates (i.e., at loads within ±10 percent of L<E T="52">avg</E>). When two RATA load levels are designated as normal, the analysis shall be performed at the higher load level, unless there are fewer than 168 acceptable data points available at that load level, in which case the analysis shall be performed at the lower load level. If, for a particular flow monitor, fewer than 168 acceptable hourly flow-to-load ratios (or GHR values) are available at any of the load levels designated as normal, a flow-to-load (or GHR) evaluation is not required for that monitor for that calendar quarter.</P>

              <P>(5) For each flow monitor, use Equation B-2 in this appendix to calculate E<E T="52">h</E>, the absolute percentage difference between each hourly R<E T="52">h</E> value and R<E T="52">ref</E>, the reference value of the flow-to-load ratio, as determined in accordance with section 7.7 of appendix A to this part.

              <P>(6) Equation B-2 shall be used in a consistent manner. That is, use R<E T="52">ref</E> and R<E T="52">h</E> if the flow-to-load ratio is being evaluated, and use (GHR)<E T="52">ref</E> and (GHR)<E T="52">h</E> if the gross heat rate is being evaluated.

If the latter option is selected, the abbreviated flow-to-load test shall be completed within 168 unit operating hours of the probationary calibration error test (or, for peaking units, within 30 unit operating days, if that is less restrictive). Data from the monitor are considered to be conditionally valid (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), beginning with the hour of the probationary calibration error test.</P>

              <P>(b) Operate the unit(s) in such a way as to reproduce, as closely as practicable, the exact conditions at the time of the most recent normal-load flow RATA. To achieve this, it is recommended that the load be held constant to within ±10.0 percent of the average load during the RATA and that the diluent gas (CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E>) concentration be maintained within ±0.5 percent CO<E T="52">2</E> or O<E T="52">2</E> of the average diluent concentration during the RATA. For common stacks, to the extent practicable, use the same combination of units and load levels that were used during the RATA. When the process parameters have been set, record a minimum of six and a maximum of 12 consecutive hourly average flow rates, using the flow monitor(s) for which E<E T="52">f</E> was outside the applicable limit. For peaking units, a minimum of three and a maximum of 12 consecutive hourly average flow rates are required. Also record the corresponding hourly load values and, if applicable, the hourly diluent gas concentrations. Calculate the flow-to-load ratio (or GHR) for each hour in the test hour period, using Equation B-1 or B-1a. Determine E<E T="52">h</E> for each hourly flow-to-load ratio (or GHR), using Equation B-2 of this appendix and then calculate E<E T="52">f</E>, the arithmetic average of the E<E T="52">h</E> values.</P>

              <P>(c) The results of the abbreviated flow-to-load test shall be considered acceptable, and no further action is required if the value of E<E T="52">f</E> does not exceed the applicable limit specified in section 2.2.5 of this appendix. All conditionally valid data recorded by the flow monitor shall be considered quality-assured, beginning with the hour of the probationary calibration error test that preceded the abbreviated flow-to-load test (if applicable). However, if E<E T="52">f</E> is outside the applicable limit, all conditionally valid data recorded by the flow monitor (if applicable) shall be considered invalid back to the hour of the probationary calibration error test that preceded the abbreviated flow-to-load test, and a single-load RATA is required in accordance with section 2.2.5.2 of this appendix. If the flow monitor must be re-linearized, however, a 3-load RATA is required.</P>

If two load levels (or operating levels) are designated as normal, the required RATA(s) may be done at either load level (or operating level).</P>
              <P>(b) For flow monitors installed on peaking units and bypass stacks, and for flow monitors that qualify to perform only single-level RATAs under section 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part, all required semiannual or annual relative accuracy test audits shall be single-load (or single-level) audits at the normal load (or operating level), as defined in section 6.5.2.1(d) of appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(c) For all other flow monitors, the RATAs shall be performed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) An annual 2-load (or 2-level) flow RATA shall be done at the two most frequently used load levels (or operating levels), as determined under section 6.5.2.1(d) of appendix A to this part, or (if applicable) at the operating levels determined under section 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part. Alternatively, a 3-load (or 3-level) flow RATA at the low, mid, and high load levels (or operating levels), as defined under section 6.5.2.1(b) of appendix A to this part, may be performed in lieu of the 2-load (or 2-level) annual RATA.</P>
              <P>(2) If the flow monitor is on a semiannual RATA frequency, 2-load (or 2-level) flow RATAs and single-load (or single-level) flow RATAs at the normal load level (or normal operating level) may be performed alternately.</P>
              <P>(3) A single-load (or single-level) annual flow RATA may be performed in lieu of the 2-load (or 2-level) RATA if the results of an historical load data analysis show that in the time period extending from the ending date of the last annual flow RATA to a date that is no more than 21 days prior to the date of the current annual flow RATA, the unit (or combination of units, for a common stack) has operated at a single load level (or operating level) (low, mid, or high), for ≥85.0 percent of the time. Alternatively, a flow monitor may qualify for a single-load (or single-level) RATA if the 85.0 percent criterion is met in the time period extending from the beginning of the quarter in which the last annual flow RATA was performed through the end of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter of current annual flow RATA.</P>
              <P>(4) A 3-load (or 3-level) RATA, at the low-, mid-, and high-load levels (or operating levels), as determined under section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part, shall be performed at least once every twenty consecutive calendar quarters, except for flow monitors that are exempted from 3-load (or 3-level) RATA testing under section 6.5.2(b) or 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part.</P>

              <P>(5) A 3-load (or 3-level) RATA is required whenever a flow monitor is re-linearized, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> when its polynomial coefficients or K factor(s) are changed, except for flow monitors that are exempted from 3-load (or 3-level) RATA testing under section 6.5.2(b) or 6.5.2(e) of appendix A to this part. For monitors so exempted under section 6.5.2(b), a single-load flow RATA is required. For monitors so exempted under section 6.5.2(e), either a single-level RATA or a 2-level RATA is required, depending on the number of operating levels documented in the monitoring plan for the unit.</P>

              <P>(6) For all multi-level flow audits, the audit points at adjacent load levels or at adjacent operating levels (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mid and high) shall be separated by no less than 25.0 percent of the “range of operation,” as defined in section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(d) A RATA of a moisture monitoring system shall be performed whenever the coefficient, K factor or mathematical algorithm determined under section 6.5.7 of appendix A to this part is changed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.3.1.4 Number of RATA Attempts</HD>
              <P>The owner or operator may perform as many RATA attempts as are necessary to achieve the desired relative accuracy test audit frequencies and/or bias adjustment factors. However, the data validation procedures in section 2.3.2 of this appendix must be followed.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.3.2 Data Validation</HD>
              <P>(a) A RATA shall not commence if the monitoring system is operating out-of-control with respect to any of the daily and quarterly quality assurance assessments required by sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this appendix or with respect to the additional calibration error test requirements in section 2.1.3 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(b) Each required RATA shall be done according to paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The RATA may be done “cold,” i.e., with no corrective maintenance, repair, calibration adjustments, re-linearization or reprogramming of the monitoring system prior to the test.</P>

              <P>(2) The RATA may be done after performing only the routine or non-routine calibration adjustments described in section 2.1.3 of this appendix at the zero and/or upscale calibration gas levels, but no other corrective maintenance, repair, re-linearization or reprogramming of the monitoring system. Trial RATA runs may be performed after the calibration adjustments and additional adjustments within the allowable limits in section 2.1.3 of this appendix may be made prior to the RATA, as necessary, to <PRTPAGE P="403"/>optimize the performance of the CEMS. The trial RATA runs need not be reported, provided that they meet the specification for trial RATA runs in § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>). However, if, for any trial run, the specification in § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>) is not met, the trial run shall be counted as an aborted RATA attempt.</P>
              <P>(3) The RATA may be done after repair, corrective maintenance, re-linearization or reprogramming of the monitoring system. In this case, the monitoring system shall be considered out-of-control from the hour in which the repair, corrective maintenance, re-linearization or reprogramming is commenced until the RATA has been passed. Alternatively, the data validation procedures and associated timelines in §§ 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (ix) may be followed upon completion of the necessary repair, corrective maintenance, re-linearization or reprogramming. If the procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) are used, the words “quality assurance” apply instead of the word “recertification.”</P>
              <P>(c) Once a RATA is commenced, the test must be done hands-off. No adjustment of the monitor's calibration is permitted during the RATA test period, other than the routine calibration adjustments following daily calibration error tests, as described in section 2.1.3 of this appendix. If a routine daily calibration error test is performed and passed just prior to a RATA (or during a RATA test period) and a mathematical correction factor is automatically applied by the DAHS, the correction factor shall be applied to all subsequent data recorded by the monitor, including the RATA test data. For 2-level and 3-level flow monitor audits, no linearization or reprogramming of the monitor is permitted in between load levels.</P>

              <P>(d) For single-load (or single-level) RATAs, if a daily calibration error test is failed during a RATA test period, prior to completing the test, the RATA must be repeated. Data from the monitor are invalidated prospectively from the hour of the failed calibration error test until the hour of completion of a subsequent successful calibration error test. The subsequent RATA shall not be commenced until the monitor has successfully passed a calibration error test in accordance with section 2.1.3 of this appendix. For multiple-load (or multiple-level) flow RATAs, each load level (or operating level) is treated as a separate RATA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> when a calibration error test is failed prior to completing the RATA at a particular load level (or operating level), only the RATA at that load level (or operating level) must be repeated; the results of any previously-passed RATA(s) at the other load level(s) (or operating level(s)) are unaffected, unless the monitor's polynomial coefficients or K-factor(s) must be changed to correct the problem that caused the calibration failure, in which case a subsequent 3-load (or 3-level) RATA is required), except as otherwise provided in section 2.3.1.3 (c)(5) of this appendix.</P>

              <P>(e) For a RATA performed using the option in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, if the RATA is failed (that is, if the relative accuracy exceeds the applicable specification in section 3.3 of appendix A to this part) or if the RATA is aborted prior to completion due to a problem with the CEMS, then the CEMS is out-of-control and all emission data from the CEMS are invalidated prospectively from the hour in which the RATA is failed or aborted. Data from the CEMS remain invalid until the hour of completion of a subsequent RATA that meets the applicable specification in section 3.3 of appendix A to this part. If the option in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to use the data validation procedures and associated timelines in §§ 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through(b)(3)(ix) has been selected, the beginning and end of the out-of-control period shall be determined in accordance with § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(A) and (B). Note that when a RATA is aborted for a reason other than monitoring system malfunction (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (h) of this section), this does not trigger an out-of-control period for the monitoring system.</P>
              <P>(f) For a 2-level or 3-level flow RATA, if, at any load level (or operating level), a RATA is failed or aborted due to a problem with the flow monitor, the RATA at that load level (or operating level) must be repeated. The flow monitor is considered out-of-control and data from the monitor are invalidated from the hour in which the test is failed or aborted and remain invalid until the passing of a RATA at the failed load level (or operating level), unless the option in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to use the data validation procedures and associated timelines in § 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) has been selected, in which case the beginning and end of the out-of-control period shall be determined in accordance with § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(A) and (B). Flow RATA(s) that were previously passed at the other load level(s) (or operating level(s)) do not have to be repeated unless the flow monitor must be re-linearized following the failed or aborted test. If the flow monitor is re-linearized, a subsequent 3-load (or 3-level) RATA is required, except as otherwise provided in section 2.3.1.3(c)(5) of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(g) Data validation for failed RATAs for a CO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor (or an O<E T="52">2</E> monitor used to measure CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions), a NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitor, and a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring system shall be done according to paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) For a CO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor (or an O<E T="52">2</E> monitor used to measure CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions) which also serves as the diluent component in a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring system, if the CO<E T="52">2</E> (or O<E T="52">2</E>) RATA is failed, then <PRTPAGE P="404"/>both the CO<E T="52">2</E> (or O<E T="52">2</E>) monitor and the associated NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent system are considered out-of-control, beginning with the hour of completion of the failed CO<E T="52">2</E> (or O<E T="52">2</E>) monitor RATA, and continuing until the hour of completion of subsequent hands-off RATAs which demonstrate that both systems have met the applicable relative accuracy specifications in sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 of appendix A to this part, unless the option in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to use the data validation procedures and associated timelines in § 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) has been selected, in which case the beginning and end of the out-of-control period shall be determined in accordance with § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(A) and (B).</P>
              <P>(2) This paragraph (g)(2) applies only to a NO<E T="52">X</E> pollutant concentration monitor that serves both as the NO<E T="52">X</E> component of a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system (to measure NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions) and as the NO<E T="52">X</E> component in a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring system (to measure NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in lb/mmBtu). If the RATA of the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system is failed, then both the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system and the associated NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent monitoring system are considered out-of-control, beginning with the hour of completion of the failed NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration RATA, and continuing until the hour of completion of subsequent hands-off RATAs which demonstrate that both systems have met the applicable relative accuracy specifications in sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.7 of appendix A to this part, unless the option in paragraph (b)(3) of this section to use the data validation procedures and associated timelines in § 75.20(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(ix) has been selected, in which case the beginning and end of the out-of-control period shall be determined in accordance with § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(A) and (B).</P>
              <P>(h) For each monitoring system, report the results of all completed and partial RATAs that affect data validation (i.e., all completed, passed RATAs; all completed, failed RATAs; and all RATAs aborted due to a problem with the CEMS, including trial RATA runs counted as failed test attempts under paragraph (b)(2) of this section or under § 75.20(b)(3)(vii)(F)) in the quarterly report required under § 75.64. Note that RATA attempts that are aborted or invalidated due to problems with the reference method or due to operational problems with the affected unit(s) need not be reported. Such runs do not affect the validation status of emission data recorded by the CEMS. However, a record of all RATAs, trial RATA runs and RATA attempts (whether reported or not) must be kept on-site as part of the official test log for each monitoring system.</P>
              <P>(i) Each time that a hands-off RATA of an SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor, a NO<E T="52">x-</E>diluent monitoring system, a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system, or a flow monitor is passed, perform a bias test in accordance with section 7.6.4 of appendix A to this part. Apply the appropriate bias adjustment factor to the reported SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, or flow rate data, in accordance with section 7.6.5 of appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(j) Failure of the bias test does not result in the monitoring system being out-of-control.</P>
              <P>(k) The results of any certification, recertification, diagnostic, or quality assurance test required under this part may not be used to validate the emissions data required under this part, if the test is performed using EPA Protocol gas from a production site that is not participating in the PGVP, except as provided in § 75.21(g)(7) or if the cylinder(s) are analyzed by an independent laboratory and shown to meet the requirements of section 5.1.4(b) of appendix A to this part.</P>

              <P>(b) Except for SO<E T="52">2</E> monitoring system RATAs, the grace period shall begin with the first unit (or stack) operating hour following the calendar quarter in which the required RATA was due. For SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor RATAs, the grace period shall begin with the first unit (or stack) operating hour in which fuel with a total sulfur content higher than that of very low sulfur fuel (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) is burned in the unit(s), following the quarter in which the required RATA is due. Data validation during a RATA grace period shall be done in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="405"/>the applicable provisions in section 2.3.2 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(c) If, at the end of the 720 unit (or stack) operating hour grace period, the RATA has not been completed, data from the monitoring system shall be invalid, beginning with the first unit operating hour following the expiration of the grace period. Data from the CEMS remain invalid until the hour of completion of a subsequent hands-off RATA. The deadline for the next test shall be either two QA operating quarters (if a semiannual RATA frequency is obtained) or four QA operating quarters (if an annual RATA frequency is obtained) after the quarter in which the RATA is completed, not to exceed eight calendar quarters.</P>
              <P>(d) When a RATA is done during a grace period in order to satisfy a RATA requirement from a previous quarter, the deadline for the next RATA shall determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If the grace period RATA qualifies for a reduced, (i.e., annual), RATA frequency the deadline for the next RATA shall be set at three QA operating quarters after the quarter in which the grace period test is completed.</P>
              <P>(2) If the grace period RATA qualifies for the standard, (i.e., semiannual), RATA frequency the deadline for the next RATA shall be set at two QA operating quarters after the quarter in which the grace period test is completed.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding these requirements, no more than eight successive calendar quarters shall elapse after the quarter in which the grace period test is completed, without a subsequent RATA having been conducted.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.3.4 Bias Adjustment Factor</HD>

              <P>Except as otherwise specified in section 7.6.5 of appendix A to this part, if an SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration monitor, a flow monitor, a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent CEMS, or a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration monitoring system used to calculate NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions fails the bias test specified in section 7.6 of appendix A to this part, use the bias adjustment factor given in Equations A-11 and A-12 of appendix A to this part or the allowable alternative BAF specified in section 7.6.5(b) of appendix A of this part, to adjust the monitored data.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.4 Recertification, Quality Assurance, RATA Frequency and Bias Adjustment Factors (Special Considerations)</HD>
              <P>(a) When a significant change is made to a monitoring system such that recertification of the monitoring system is required in accordance with § 75.20(b), a recertification test (or tests) must be performed to ensure that the CEMS continues to generate valid data. In all recertifications, a RATA will be one of the required tests; for some recertifications, other tests will also be required. A recertification test may be used to satisfy the quality assurance test requirement of this appendix. For example, if, for a particular change made to a CEMS, one of the required recertification tests is a linearity check and the linearity check is successful, then, unless another such recertification event occurs in that same QA operating quarter, it would not be necessary to perform an additional linearity test of the CEMS in that quarter to meet the quality assurance requirement of section 2.2.1 of this appendix. For this reason, EPA recommends that owners or operators coordinate component replacements, system upgrades, and other events that may require recertification, to the extent practicable, with the periodic quality assurance testing required by this appendix. When a quality assurance test is done for the dual purpose of recertification and routine quality assurance, the applicable data validation procedures in § 75.20(b)(3) shall be followed.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in section 2.3.3 of this appendix, whenever a passing RATA of a gas monitor is performed, or a passing 2-load (or 2-level) RATA or a passing 3-load (or 3-level) RATA of a flow monitor is performed (irrespective of whether the RATA is done to satisfy a recertification requirement or to meet the quality assurance requirements of this appendix, or both), the RATA frequency (semi-annual or annual) shall be established based upon the date and time of completion of the RATA and the relative accuracy percentage obtained. For 2-load (or 2-level) and 3-load (or 3-level) flow RATAs, use the highest percentage relative accuracy at any of the loads (or levels) to determine the RATA frequency. The results of a single-load (or single-level) flow RATA may be used to establish the RATA frequency when the single-load (or single-level) flow RATA is specifically required under section 2.3.1.3(b) of this appendix or when the single-load (or single-level) RATA is allowed under section 2.3.1.3(c) of this appendix for a unit that has operated at one load level (or operating level) for ≥85.0 percent of the time since the last annual flow RATA. No other single-load (or single-level) flow RATA may be used to establish an annual RATA frequency; however, a 2-load or 3-load (or a 2-level or 3-level) flow RATA may be performed at any time or in place of any required single-load (or single-level) RATA, in order to establish an annual RATA frequency.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.5 Other Audits</HD>

              <P>Affected units may be subject to relative accuracy test audits at any time. If a monitor or continuous emission monitoring system fails the relative accuracy test during the audit, the monitor or continuous emission monitoring system shall be considered to be out-of-control beginning with the date <PRTPAGE P="406"/>and time of completion of the audit, and continuing until a successful audit test is completed following corrective action. If a monitor or monitoring system fails the bias test during an audit, use the bias adjustment factor given by equations A-11 and A-12 in appendix A to this part to adjust the monitored data. Apply this adjustment factor from the date and time of completion of the audit until the date and time of completion of a relative accuracy test audit that does not show bias.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">1. Applicability</HD>

              <P>1.1 This protocol may be used in lieu of continuous SO<E T="52">2</E> pollutant concentration and flow monitors for the purpose of determining hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions and heat input from: gas-fired units, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter, or oil-fired units, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter. Section 2.1 of this appendix provides procedures for measuring oil or gaseous fuel flow using a fuel flowmeter, section 2.2 of this appendix provides procedures for conducting oil sampling and analysis to determine sulfur content and gross calorific value (GCV) of fuel oil, and section 2.3 of this appendix provides procedures for determining the sulfur content and GCV of gaseous fuels.</P>

              <P>1.2 Pursuant to the procedures in § 75.20, complete all testing requirements to certify use of this protocol in lieu of a flow monitor and an SO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system. Complete all testing requirements no later than the applicable deadline specified in § 75.4. Apply to the Administrator for initial certification to use this protocol no later than 45 days after the completion of all certification tests.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Procedure</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.1 Fuel Flowmeter Measurements</HD>
              <P>For each hour when the unit is combusting fuel, measure and record the flow rate of fuel combusted by the unit, except as provided in section 2.1.4 of this appendix. Measure the flow rate of fuel with an in-line fuel flowmeter, and automatically record the data with a data acquisition and handling system, except as provided in section 2.1.4 of this appendix.</P>

              <P>2.1.1 Measure the flow rate of each fuel entering and being combusted by the unit. If, on an annual basis, more than 5.0 percent of the fuel from the main pipe is diverted from the unit without being burned and that diversion occurs downstream of the fuel flowmeter, an additional in-line fuel flowmeter is required to account for the unburned fuel. In this case, record the flow rate of each fuel <PRTPAGE P="412"/>combusted by the unit as the difference between the flow measured in the pipe leading to the unit and the flow in the pipe diverting fuel away from the unit. However, the additional fuel flowmeter is not required if, on an annual basis, the total amount of fuel diverted away from the unit, expressed as a percentage of the total annual fuel usage by the unit is demonstrated to be less than or equal to 5.0 percent. The owner or operator may make this demonstration in the following manner:</P>
              <P>2.1.1.1 For existing units with fuel usage data from fuel flowmeters, if data are submitted from a previous year demonstrating that the total diverted yearly fuel does not exceed 5% of the total fuel used; or</P>
              <P>2.1.1.2 For new units which do not have historical data, if a letter is submitted signed by the designated representative certifying that, in the future, the diverted fuel will not exceed 5.0% of the total annual fuel usage; or</P>
              <P>2.1.1.3 By using a method approved by the Administrator under § 75.66(d).</P>

              <P>2.1.2 Install and use fuel flowmeters meeting the requirements of this appendix in a pipe going to each unit, or install and use a fuel flowmeter in a common pipe header (as defined in § 72.2). However, the use of a fuel flowmeter in a common pipe header and the provisions of sections 2.1.2.1 and 2.1.2.2 of this appendix shall not apply to any unit that is using the provisions of subpart H of this part to monitor, record, and report NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions under a State or federal NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emission reduction program, unless both of the following are true: all of the units served by the common pipe are affected units, and all of the units have similar efficiencies. When a fuel flowmeter is installed in a common pipe header, proceed as follows:</P>

              <P>2.1.2.1 Measure the fuel flow rate in the common pipe, and combine SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions (Acid Rain Program units only) for the affected units for recordkeeping and compliance purposes; and</P>

              <P>For an oil-fired unit that uses gas solely for start-up or burner ignition, a gas-fired unit that uses oil solely for start-up or burner ignition, or an oil-fired unit that uses a different grade of oil solely for start-up or burner ignition, a fuel flowmeter for the start-up fuel is permitted but not required. Estimate the volume of oil combusted for each start-up or ignition either by using a fuel flowmeter or by using the dimensions of the storage container and measuring the depth of the fuel in the storage container before and after each start-up or ignition. A fuel flowmeter used solely for start-up or ignition fuel is not subject to the calibration requirements of sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 of this appendix. Gas combusted solely for start-up or burner ignition does not need to be measured separately.</P>

              <P>The designated representative of a unit that is restricted by its Federal, State or local permit to combusting a particular fuel only during emergencies where the primary fuel is not available is exempt from certifying a fuel flowmeter for use during combustion of the emergency fuel. During any <PRTPAGE P="413"/>hour in which the emergency fuel is combusted, report the hourly heat input to be the maximum rated heat input of the unit for the fuel. Use the maximum potential sulfur content for the fuel (from Table D-6 of this appendix) and the fuel flow rate corresponding to the maximum hourly heat input to calculate the hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emission rate, using Equations D-2 through D-4 (as applicable). Alternatively, if a certified fuel flowmeter is available for the emergency fuel, you may use the measured hourly fuel flow rates in the calculations. Also, if daily samples or weekly composite samples (fuel oil, only) of the fuel's total sulfur content, GCV, and (if applicable) density are taken during the combustion of the emergency fuel, as described in section 2.2 or 2.3 of this appendix, the sample results may be used to calculate the hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions and heat input rates, in lieu of using maximum potential values. The designated representative shall also provide notice under § 75.61(a)(6) for each period when the emergency fuel is combusted.</P>

              <P>For the purposes of initial certification, each fuel flowmeter used to meet the requirements of this protocol shall meet a flowmeter accuracy of 2.0 percent of the upper range value (i.e. maximum fuel flow rate measurable by the flowmeter) across the range of fuel flow rate to be measured at the unit. Flowmeter accuracy may be determined under section 2.1.5.1 of this appendix for initial certification in any of the following ways (as applicable): by design (orifice, nozzle, and venturi-type flowmeters, only) or by measurement under laboratory conditions; by the manufacturer; by an independent laboratory; or by the owner or operator. Flowmeter accuracy may also be determined under section 2.1.5.2 of this appendix by in-line comparison against a reference flowmeter.</P>
              <P>2.1.5.1 Use the procedures in the following standards to verify flowmeter accuracy or design, as appropriate to the type of flowmeter: ASME MFC-3M-2004, Measurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes Using Orifice, Nozzle, and Venturi; ASME MFC-4M-1986 (Reaffirmed 1997), Measurement of Gas Flow by Turbine Meters; American Gas Association Report No. 3, Orifice Metering of Natural Gas and Other Related Hydrocarbon Fluids Part 1: General Equations and Uncertainty Guidelines (October 1990 Edition), Part 2: Specification and Installation Requirements (February 1991 Edition), and Part 3: Natural Gas Applications (August 1992 edition) (excluding the modified flow-calculation method in part 3); Section 8, Calibration from American Gas Association Transmission Measurement Committee Report No. 7: Measurement of Gas by Turbine Meters (Second Revision, April 1996); ASME-MFC-5M-1985 (Reaffirmed 1994), Measurement of Liquid Flow in Closed Conduits Using Transit-Time Ultrasonic Flowmeters; ASME MFC-6M-1998, Measurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes Using Vortex Flowmeters; ASME MFC-7M-1987 (Reaffirmed 1992), Measurement of Gas Flow by Means of Critical Flow Venturi Nozzles; ISO 8316: 1987(E) Measurement of Liquid Flow in Closed Conduits—Method by Collection of the Liquid in a Volumetric Tank; American Petroleum Institute (API) Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, Chapter 4—Proving Systems, Section 2—Pipe Provers (Provers Accumulating at Least 10,000 Pulses), Second Edition, March 2001, Section 3—Small Volume Provers, First Edition, July 1988, Reaffirmed October 1993, and Section 5—Master-Meter Provers, Second Edition, May 2000; American Petroleum Institute (API) Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, Chapter 22—Testing Protocol, Section 2—Differential Pressure Flow Measurement Devices, First Edition, August 2005; or ASME MFC-9M-1988 (Reaffirmed 2001), Measurement of Liquid Flow in Closed Conduits by Weighing Method, for all other flowmeter types (all incorporated by reference under § 75.6 of this part). The Administrator may also approve other procedures that use equipment traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology standards. Document such procedures, the equipment used, and the accuracy of the procedures in the monitoring plan for the unit, and submit a petition signed by the designated representative under § 75.66(c). If the flowmeter accuracy exceeds 2.0 percent of the upper range value, the flowmeter does not qualify for use under this part.</P>
              <P>2.1.5.2 (a) Alternatively, determine the flowmeter accuracy of a fuel flowmeter used for the purposes of this part by comparing it to the measured flow from a reference flowmeter which has been either designed according to the specifications of American Gas Association Report No. 3 or ASME MFC-3M-1989, as cited in section 2.1.5.1 of this appendix, or tested for accuracy during the previous 365 days, using a standard listed in section 2.1.5.1 of this appendix or other procedure approved by the Administrator under § 75.66 (all standards incorporated by reference under § 75.6). Any secondary elements, such as pressure and temperature transmitters, must be calibrated immediately prior to the comparison. Perform the comparison over a period of no more than seven consecutive unit operating days. Compare the average of three fuel flow rate readings over 20 minutes or longer for each meter at each of three different flow rate levels. The three flow rate levels shall correspond to:</P>
              <P>(1) Normal full unit operating load,</P>

              <P>(c) Notwithstanding the requirement for calibration of the reference flowmeter within 365 days prior to an accuracy test, when an in-place reference meter or prover is used for quality assurance under section 2.1.6 of this appendix, the reference meter calibration requirement may be waived if, during the previous in-place accuracy test with that reference meter, the reference flowmeter and the flowmeter being tested agreed to within ±1.0 percent of each other at all levels tested. This exception to calibration and flowmeter accuracy testing requirements for the reference flowmeter shall apply for periods of no longer than five consecutive years (i.e., 20 consecutive calendar quarters).</P>
              <P>2.1.5.3 If the flowmeter accuracy exceeds the specification in section 2.1.5 of this appendix, the flowmeter does not qualify for use for this appendix. Either recalibrate the flowmeter until the flowmeter accuracy is within the performance specification, or replace the flowmeter with another one that is demonstrated to meet the performance specification. Substitute for fuel flow rate using the missing data procedures in section 2.4.2 of this appendix until quality-assured fuel flow data become available.</P>
              <P>2.1.5.4 For purposes of initial certification, when a flowmeter is tested against a reference fuel flow rate (i.e., fuel flow rate from another fuel flowmeter under section 2.1.5.2 of this appendix or flow rate from a procedure performed according to a standard incorporated by reference under section 2.1.5.1 of this appendix), report the results of flowmeter accuracy tests in a manner consistent with Table D-1.</P>

In addition, if, during normal operation of the fuel flowmeter, one or more transmitters or transducers malfunction, data from the fuel flowmeter shall be considered invalid from the hour of the transmitter or transducer failure until the hour of completion of a successful 3-level transmitter or transducer accuracy test. During fuel flowmeter out-of-control periods, provide data from another fuel flowmeter that meets the requirements of § 75.20(d) and section 2.1.5 of this appendix, or substitute for fuel flow rate using the missing data procedures in section 2.4.2 of this appendix.

Note, however, that these procedures may not be used unless the 168-hour baseline data requirement of section 2.1.7.1 of this appendix has been met. If, following a flowmeter accuracy test or (if applicable) a flowmeter transmitter test and primary element inspection, the procedures of this section are performed during each subsequent fuel flowmeter QA operating quarter, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter (excluding the quarter(s) in which the baseline data are collected), then these procedures may be used to meet the requirement for periodic quality assurance for a period of up to 20 calendar quarters from the previous periodic quality assurance procedure(s) performed according to sections 2.1.5.1, 2.1.5.2, or 2.1.6.1 through 2.1.6.4 of this appendix. The procedures of this section are not required for any quarter in which a flowmeter accuracy test or (if applicable) a transmitter accuracy test and a primary element inspection, are conducted.

Establish a baseline period of data consisting, at a minimum, of 168 hours of quality-assured fuel flowmeter data. Baseline data collection shall begin with the first hour of fuel flowmeter operation following completion of the most recent quality assurance procedure(s), during which only the fuel measured by the fuel flowmeter is combusted (e.g., only gas, only residual oil, or only diesel fuel is combusted by the unit). During the baseline data collection period, the owner or operator may exclude as non-representative any hour in which the unit is “ramping” up or down, (i.e., the load during the hour differs by more than 15.0 percent from the load in the previous or subsequent hour) and may exclude any hour in which the unit load is in the lower 25.0 percent of the range of operation, as defined in section 6.5.2.1 of appendix A to this part (unless operation in this lower 25.0 percent of the range is considered normal for the unit). The baseline data must be obtained no later than the end of the fourth calendar quarter following the calendar quarter of the most recent quality assurance procedure for that fuel flowmeter.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “other gaseous fuel(s)” excludes compounds such as mercaptans when they are added in trace quantities for safety reasons.</P>
              <P>(d) If the results of fuel sampling and analysis under paragraph (a)(2), (a)(3), or (b) of this section show that the fuel does not qualify as pipeline natural gas, proceed as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) If the fuel still qualifies as natural gas under section 2.3.2.4 of this appendix, re-classify the fuel as natural gas and determine the appropriate default SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate for the fuel, according to section 2.3.2.1.1 of this appendix; or</P>

In addition, the owner or operator shall use Equation D-1h in this appendix to calculate a default SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate for the fuel, based on the results of the sample analysis that exceeded 20 grains/100 scf of total sulfur, and shall use that default emission rate to report SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions under this part until section 2.3.3 of this appendix has been fully implemented.</P>
              <P>(e) If a fuel qualifies as pipeline natural gas based on the specifications in a fuel contract or tariff sheet, no additional, on-going sampling of the fuel's total sulfur content is required, provided that the contract or tariff sheet is current, valid and representative of the fuel combusted in the unit. If the fuel qualifies as pipeline natural gas based on fuel sampling and analysis, on-going sampling of the fuel's sulfur content is required annually and whenever the fuel supply source changes. For the purposes of this paragraph (e), sampling “annually” means that at least one sample is taken in each calendar year. If the results of at least 100 daily (or more frequent) total sulfur samples have been provided by the fuel supplier since the last annual assessment of the fuel's sulfur content, the data may be used as follows to satisfy the annual sampling requirement for the current year. If this option is chosen, all of the data provided by the fuel supplier shall be used. First, convert the data to monthly averages. Then, if, for each month, the average total sulfur content is 0.5 grains/100 scf or less, and if the GCV or percent methane requirement is also met, the fuel qualifies as pipeline natural gas. Alternatively, the fuel qualifies as pipeline natural gas if the analysis of the 100 (or more) total sulfur samples since the last annual assessment shows that ≥98 percent of the samples have a total sulfur content of 0.5 grains/100 scf or less and if the GCV or percent methane requirement is also met. The effective date of the annual total sulfur sampling requirement is January 1, 2003.</P>

The results of the demonstration may be used to show that daily sampling for sulfur in the fuel is sufficient, rather than hourly sampling. The procedures in this section may also be used to demonstrate that a particular gaseous fuel qualifies to use a default SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate (calculated using Equation D-1h in section 2.3.2.1.1 of this appendix) for the purpose of reporting hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions under this part. To make this demonstration, proceed as follows. Provide a minimum of 720 hours of data, indicating the total sulfur content of the gaseous fuel (in gr/100 scf). The demonstration data shall be obtained using either manual hourly sampling or an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) capable of determining fuel total sulfur content on an hourly basis. For gaseous fuel produced by a variable process, the data shall be representative of all process operating conditions including seasonal or annual variations which may affect fuel sulfur content.</P>

              <P>(b) If the data are collected with an on-line GC, reduce the data to hourly average values of the total sulfur content of the fuel. If manual hourly sampling is used, the results of each hourly sample analysis shall be the total sulfur value for that hour.

Use all of the hourly average values of total sulfur content in grains/100 scf to calculate the mean value and the standard deviation. Also determine the 90th percentile and maximum hourly values of the total sulfur content for the data set. If the standard deviation of the hourly values from the mean does not exceed 5.0 grains/100 scf, the fuel has a low sulfur variability. If the standard deviation exceeds 5.0 grains/100 scf, the fuel has a high sulfur variability.

              <P>(2) If the gaseous fuel has a high sulfur variability, but the maximum hourly value of the total sulfur content does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf, the owner or operator may either perform hourly sampling of the fuel's total sulfur content using an on-line GC, or may report hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions data using a default SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate calculated by substituting the maximum value of the total sulfur content in Equation D-1h.</P>
              <P>(3) If the gaseous fuel has a high sulfur variability and the maximum hourly value of the total sulfur content exceeds 20 grains/100 scf, the owner or operator shall perform hourly sampling of the fuel's total sulfur content, using an on-line GC.</P>

              <P>(1) If the actual value is to be used in the calculations, apply the results of each daily sample to all hours in the day on which the sample is taken; or</P>
              <P>(2) If the highest value in the previous 30 daily samples is to be used in the calculations, apply that value to all hours in the current day. If, for a particular unit, fewer than 30 daily samples have been collected, use the highest value from all available samples until 30 days of historical sampling results have been obtained.</P>
              <P>(b) For annual samples of total sulfur content:</P>
              <P>(1) For pipeline natural gas, use the results of annual sample analyses in the calculations only if the results exceed 0.5 grains/100 scf. In that case, if the fuel still qualifies as natural gas, follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the fuel does not qualify as natural gas, the owner or operator shall implement the procedures in section 2.3.3 of this appendix, in the time frame specified in sections 2.3.1.4(d) and 2.3.2.4(d) of this appendix;</P>
              <P>(2) For natural gas, if only one sample is taken, apply the results beginning at the date on which the sample was taken. If multiple samples are taken and averaged, apply the results beginning at the date on which the last sample used in the annual assessment was taken;</P>
              <P>(3) For other gaseous fuels with an annual sampling requirement under section 2.3.6(b)(4) of this appendix, use the sample results in the calculations only if the results exceed the 90th percentile value or maximum value (as applicable) from the 720-hour demonstration of fuel sulfur content and variability under section 2.3.6 of this appendix.</P>
              <P>(c) For monthly samples of the fuel GCV:</P>
              <P>(1) If the actual monthly value is to be used in the calculations and only one sample is taken, apply the results starting from the date on which the sample was taken. If multiple samples are taken and averaged, apply the monthly average GCV value to the entire month; or</P>
              <P>(2) If an assumed value (contract maximum or highest value from previous year's samples) is to be used in the calculations, apply the assumed value to all hours in each month of the quarter unless a higher value is obtained in a monthly GCV sample (or, if multiple samples are taken and averaged, if the monthly average exceeds the assumed value). In that case, if only one monthly sample is taken, use the sampled value, starting from the date on which the sample was taken. If multiple samples are taken and averaged, use the average value for the entire month in which the assumed value was exceeded. Consider the sample (or, if applicable, monthly average) results to be the new assumed value. Continue using the new assumed value unless and until one of the following occurs (as applicable to the reporting option selected): The assumed value is superseded by a higher value from a subsequent monthly sample (or by a higher monthly average); or the assumed value is superseded by a new contract in which case the new contract value becomes the assumed value at the time the fuel specified under the new contract begins to be combusted in the unit; or both the calendar year in which the new sampled value (or monthly average) exceeded the assumed value and the subsequent calendar year have elapsed.</P>
              <P>(d) For samples of gaseous fuel delivered in shipments or lots:</P>
              <P>(1) If the actual value for the most recent shipment is to be used in the calculations, apply the results of the most recent sample, from the date on which the sample was taken until the date on which the next sample is taken; or</P>
              <P>(2) If an assumed value (contract maximum or highest value from previous year's samples) is to be used in the calculations, apply the assumed value unless a higher value is obtained in a sample of a shipment. In that case, use the sampled value, starting from the date on which the sample was taken. Consider the sample results to be the new assumed value. Continue using the new assumed value unless and until: it is superseded by a higher value from a sample of a subsequent shipment; or (if applicable) it is superseded by a new contract in which case the new contract value becomes the assumed value at the time the fuel specified under the new contract begins to be combusted in the unit; or (if applicable) both the calendar year in which the sampled value exceeded the assumed value and the subsequent calendar year have elapsed.</P>
              <P>(e) When the owner or operator elects to use assumed values in the calculations, the results of periodic samples of sulfur content and GCV which show that the assumed value has not been exceeded need not be reported. Keep these sample results on file, in a format suitable for inspection.</P>

              <P>(f) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, in cases where the sample results are provided to the owner or operator by the supplier of the fuel, the owner or operator shall begin using the sampling results on the date of receipt of those results, rather than on the date that the sample was taken.<PRTPAGE P="434"/>

              <P>Whenever data are missing from any primary fuel flowmeter system (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) and there is no backup system available to record the fuel flow rate, use the procedures in sections 2.4.2.2 and 2.4.2.3 of this appendix to account for the flow rate of fuel combusted at the unit for each hour during the missing data period. Alternatively, for a fuel flowmeter system used to measure the fuel combusted by a <PRTPAGE P="435"/>peaking unit, the simplified fuel flow missing data procedure in section 2.4.2.1 of this appendix may be used. Before using the procedures in sections 2.4.2.2 and 2.4.2.3 of this appendix, establish load ranges for the unit using the procedures of section 2 in appendix C to this part, except for units that do not produce electrical output (i.e., megawatts) or thermal output (e.g., klb of steam per hour). The owner or operator of a unit that does not produce electrical or thermal output shall either perform missing data substitution without segregating the fuel flow rate data into bins, or may petition the Administrator under § 75.66 for permission to segregate the data into operational bins. When load ranges are used for fuel flow rate missing data purposes, separate, fuel-specific databases shall be created and maintained. A database shall be kept for each type of fuel combusted in the unit, for the hours in which the fuel is combusted alone in the unit. An additional database shall be kept for each type of fuel, for the hours in which it is co-fired with any other type(s) of fuel(s).</P>

              <P>This NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions estimation procedure may be used in lieu of a continuous NO<E T="52">X</E> emission monitoring system (lb/mmBtu) for determining the average NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate and hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> rate from gas-fired peaking units and oil-fired peaking units as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter. If a unit's operations exceed the levels required to be a peaking unit, the owner or operator shall install and certify a NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent continuous emission monitoring system no later than December 31 of the following calendar year. If the required CEMS has not been installed and certified by that date, the owner or operator shall report the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MER) (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) for each unit operating hour, starting with the first unit operating hour after the deadline and continuing until the CEMS has been provisionally certified. The provision of § 75.12 apply to excepted monitoring systems under this appendix.</P>

Apply to the Administrator for certification to use this method no later than 45 days after the completion of all certification testing. Whenever the monitoring method is to be changed, reapply to the Administrator for certification of the new monitoring method.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Procedure</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.1 Initial Performance Testing</HD>
              <P>Use the following procedures for: measuring NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates at heat input rate levels corresponding to different load levels; measuring heat input rate; and plotting the correlation between heat input rate and NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, in order to determine the emission rate of the unit(s). The requirements in section 6.1.2 of appendix A to this part shall apply to any stack testing performed to obtain O<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration measurements under this appendix, either for units using the excepted methodology in this appendix or for units using the low mass emissions excepted methodology in § 75.19.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.1 Load Selection</HD>
              <P>Establish at least four approximately equally spaced operating load points, ranging from the maximum operating load to the minimum operating load. Select the maximum and minimum operating load from the operating history of the unit during the most recent two years. (If projections indicate that the unit's maximum or minimum operating load during the next five years will be significantly different from the most recent two years, select the maximum and minimum operating load based on the projected dispatched load of the unit.) For new gas-fired peaking units or new oil-fired peaking units, select the maximum and minimum operating load from the expected maximum and minimum load to be dispatched to the unit in the first five calendar years of operation.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2 NO<E T="52">X</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> Concentration Measurements</HD>
              <P>Use the following procedures to measure NO<E T="52">X</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> concentration in order to determine NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.1 For boilers, select an excess O<E T="52">2</E> level for each fuel (and, optionally, for each combination of fuels) to be combusted that is representative for each of the four or more load levels. If a boiler operates using a single, consistent combination of fuels only, the testing may be performed using the combination rather than each fuel. If a fuel is combusted only for the purpose of testing ignition of the burners for a period of five minutes or less per ignition test or for start-up, then the boiler NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate does not need to be tested separately for that fuel. Operate the boiler at a normal or conservatively high excess oxygen level in conjunction with these tests. Measure the NO<E T="52">X</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> at each load point for each fuel or consistent fuel combination (and, optionally, for each combination of fuels) to be combusted. Measure the NO<E T="52">X</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> concentrations according to method 7E and 3A in appendix A of part 60 of this chapter. Use a minimum of 12 sample points, located according to Method 1 in appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter. The designated representative for the unit may also petition the Administrator under § 75.66 to use fewer sampling points. Such a petition shall include the proposed alternative sampling procedure and information demonstrating that there is no concentration stratification at the sampling location.</P>

              <P>2.1.2.2 For stationary gas turbines, sample at a minimum of 12 points per run at each load level. Locate the sample points according to Method 1 in appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter. For each fuel or consistent <PRTPAGE P="441"/>combination of fuels (and, optionally, for each combination of fuels), measure the NO<E T="52">X</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> concentrations at each sampling point using methods 7E and 3A in appendices A-4 and A-2 to part 60 of this chapter. For diesel or dual fuel reciprocating engines, select the sampling site to be as close as practicable to the exhaust of the engine.</P>

              <P>2.1.2.3 Allow the unit to stabilize for a minimum of 15 minutes (or longer if needed for the NO<E T="52">X</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> readings to stabilize) prior to commencing NO<E T="52">X</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, and heat input measurements. Determine the measurement system response time according to sections 8.2.5 and 8.2.6 of method 7E in appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter. When inserting the probe into the flue gas for the first sampling point in each traverse, sample for at least one minute plus twice the measurement system response time (or longer, if necessary to obtain a stable reading). For all other sampling points in each traverse, sample for at least one minute plus the measurement system response time (or longer, if necessary to obtain a stable reading). Perform three test runs at each load condition and obtain an arithmetic average of the runs for each load condition. During each test run on a boiler, record the boiler excess oxygen level at 5 minute intervals.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.3 Heat Input</HD>
              <P>Measure the total heat input (mmBtu) and heat input rate during testing (mmBtu/hr) as follows:</P>
              <P>2.1.3.1 When the unit is combusting fuel, measure and record the flow of fuel consumed. Measure the flow of fuel with an in-line flowmeter(s) and automatically record the data. If a portion of the flow is diverted from the unit without being burned, and that diversion occurs downstream of the fuel flowmeter, an in-line flowmeter is required to account for the unburned fuel. Install and calibrate in-line flow meters using the procedures and specifications contained in sections 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, and 2.1.5 of appendix D of this part. Correct any gaseous fuel flow rate measured at actual temperature and pressure to standard conditions of 68 °F and 29.92 inches of mercury.</P>
              <P>2.1.3.2 For liquid fuels, analyze fuel samples taken according to the requirements of section 2.2 of appendix D of this part to determine the heat content of the fuel. Determine heat content of liquid or gaseous fuel in accordance with the procedures in appendix F of this part. Calculate the heat input rate during testing (mmBtu/hr) associated with each load condition in accordance with equations F-19 or F-20 in appendix F of this part and total heat input using equation E-1 of this appendix. Record the heat input rate at each heat input/load point.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.4 Emergency Fuel</HD>

              <P>The designated representative of a unit that is restricted by its federal, State or local permit to combusting a particular fuel only during emergencies where the primary fuel is not available may claim an exemption from the requirements of this appendix for testing the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate during combustion of the emergency fuel. To claim this exemption, the designated representative shall include in the monitoring plan for the unit documentation that the permit restricts use of the fuel to emergencies only. When emergency fuel is combusted, report the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for the emergency fuel, in accordance with section 2.5.2.3 of this appendix. The designated representative shall also provide notice under § 75.61(a)(6) for each period when the emergency fuel is combusted.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.5 Tabulation of Results</HD>

              <P>Tabulate the results of each baseline correlation test for each fuel or, as applicable, combination of fuels, listing: time of test, duration, operating loads, heat input rate (mmBtu/hr), F-factors, excess oxygen levels, and NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations (ppm) on a dry basis (at actual excess oxygen level). Convert the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations (ppm) to NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates (to the nearest 0.001 lb/mm/Btu) according to equation F-5 of appendix F of this part or 19-3 in method 19 of appendix A of part 60 of this chapter, as appropriate. Calculate the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in lb/mmBtu for each sampling point and determine the arithmetic average NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate of each test run. Calculate the arithmetic average of the boiler excess oxygen readings for each test run. Record the arithmetic average of the three test runs as the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate and the boiler excess oxygen level for the heat input/load condition.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.6 Plotting of Results</HD>
              <P>Plot the tabulated results as an x-y graph for each fuel and (as applicable) combination of fuels combusted according to the following procedures.</P>

              <P>2.1.6.1 Plot the heat input rate (mmBtu/hr) as the independent (or x) variable and the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates (lb/mmBtu) as the dependent (or y) variable for each load point. Construct the graph by drawing straight line segments between each load point. Draw a horizontal line to the y-axis from the minimum heat input (load) point.</P>
              <P>2.1.6.2 Units that co-fire gas and oil may be tested while firing gas only and oil only instead of testing with each combination of fuels. In this case, construct a graph for each fuel.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.2 Periodic NO<E T="52">X</E> Emission Rate Testing</HD>
              <P>Retest the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate of the gas-fired peaking unit or the oil-fired peaking <PRTPAGE P="442"/>unit while combusting each type of fuel (or fuel mixture) for which a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate versus heat input rate correlation curve was derived, at least once every 20 calendar quarters. If a required retest is not completed by the end of the 20th calendar quarter following the quarter of the last test, use the missing data substitution procedures in section 2.5 of this appendix, beginning with the first unit operating hour after the end of the 20th calendar quarter. Continue using the missing data procedures until the required retest has been passed. Note that missing data substitution is fuel-specific (i.e., the use of substitute data is required only when combusting a fuel (or fuel mixture) for which the retesting deadline has not been met). Each time that a new fuel-specific correlation curve is derived from retesting, the new curve shall be used to report NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, beginning with the first operating hour in which the fuel is combusted, following the completion of the retest. Notwithstanding this requirement, for non-Acid Rain Program units that report NO<E T="52">X</E> mass emissions and heat input data only during the ozone season under § 75.74(c), if the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate testing is performed outside the ozone season, the new correlation curve may be used beginning with the first unit operating hour in the ozone season immediately following the testing.</P>

              <P>2.3.1 For a stationary gas turbine, select at least four operating parameters indicative of the turbine's NO<E T="52">X</E> formation characteristics, and define in the QA plan for the unit the acceptable ranges for these parameters at each tested load-heat input point. The acceptable parametric ranges should be based upon the turbine manufacturer's recommendations. Alternatively, the owner or operator may use sound engineering judgment and operating experience with the unit to establish the acceptable parametric ranges, provided that the rationale for selecting these ranges is included as part of the quality-assurance plan for the unit. If the gas turbine uses water or steam injection for NO<E T="52">X</E> control, the water/fuel or steam/fuel ratio shall be one of these parameters. During the NOx-heat input correlation tests, record the average value of each parameter for each load-heat input to ensure that the parameters are within the acceptable range. Redetermine the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate-heat input correlation for each fuel and (optional) combination of fuels after continuously exceeding the acceptable range of any of these parameters for one or more successive operating periods totaling more than 16 unit operating hours.</P>

              <P>2.3.2 For a diesel or dual-fuel reciprocating engine, select at least four operating parameters indicative of the engine's NO<E T="52">X</E> formation characteristics, and define in the QA plan for the unit the acceptable ranges for these parameters at each tested load-heat input point. The acceptable parametric ranges should be based upon the engine manufacturer's recommendations. Alternatively, the owner or operator may use sound engineering judgment and operating experience with the unit to establish the acceptable parametric ranges, provided that the rationale for selecting these ranges is included as part of the quality-assurance plan for the unit. Any operating parameter critical for NO<E T="52">X</E> control shall be included. During the NO<E T="52">X</E> heat-input correlation tests, record the average value of each parameter for each load-heat input to ensure that the parameters are within the acceptable range. Redetermine the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate-heat input correlation for each fuel and (optional) combination or fuels after continuously exceeding the acceptable range of any of these parameters for one or more successive operating periods totaling more than 16 unit operating hours.</P>

              <P>2.3.3 For boilers using the procedures in this appendix, the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate heat input correlation for each fuel and (optional) combination of fuels shall be redetermined if the excess oxygen level at any heat input rate (or unit operating load) continuously exceeds by more than 2 percentage points O<E T="52">2</E> from the boiler excess oxygen level recorded at the same operating heat input rate during the previous NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate test for one or more successive operating periods totaling more than 16 unit operating hours.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.4 Procedures for Determining Hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> Emission Rate</HD>

              <P>2.4.1 Record the time (hr. and min.), load (MWge or steam load in 1000 lb/hr, or mmBtu/hr thermal output), fuel flow rate and heat input rate (using the procedures in section 2.1.3 of this appendix) for each hour during which the unit combusts fuel. Calculate the total hourly heat input using equation E-1 of <PRTPAGE P="443"/>this appendix. Record the heat input rate for each fuel to the nearest 0.1 mmBtu/hr. During partial unit operating hours or during hours where more than one fuel is combusted, heat input must be represented as an hourly rate in mmBtu/hr, as if the fuel were combusted for the entire hour at that rate (and not as the actual, total heat input during that partial hour or hour) in order to ensure proper correlation with the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate graph.</P>

              <P>2.4.2 Use the graph of the baseline correlation results (appropriate for the fuel or fuel combination) to determine the NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions rate (lb/mmBtu) corresponding to the heat input rate (mmBtu/hr). Input this correlation into the data acquisition and handling system for the unit. Linearly interpolate to 0.1 mmBtu/hr heat input rate and 0.001 lb/mmBtu NO<E T="52">X</E>. For each type of fuel, calculate NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate using the baseline correlation results from the most recent test with that fuel, beginning with the date and hour of the completion of the most recent test.</P>
              <P>2.4.3 To determine the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for a unit co-firing fuels that has not been tested for that combination of fuels, interpolate between the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for each fuel as follows. Determine the heat input rate for the hour (in mmBtu/hr) for each fuel and select the corresponding NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for each fuel on the appropriate graph. (When a fuel is combusted for a partial hour, determine the fuel usage time for each fuel and determine the heat input rate from each fuel as if that fuel were combusted at that rate for the entire hour in order to select the corresponding NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate.) Calculate the total heat input to the unit in mmBtu for the hour from all fuel combusted using Equation E-1. Calculate a Btu-weighted average of the emission rates for all fuels using Equation E-2 of this appendix. For each type of fuel, calculate NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate using the baseline correlation results from the most recent test with that fuel, beginning with the date and hour of the completion of the most recent test.</P>
              <P>2.4.4 For each hour, record the critical quality assurance parameters, as identified in the monitoring plan, and as required by section 2.3 of this appendix from the date and hour of the completion of the most recent test for each type of fuel.</P>

For the purpose of providing substitute data, calculate the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) for each type of fuel combusted in the unit.</P>
              <P>2.5.1 Use the procedures of this section whenever any of the quality assurance/quality control parameters exceeds the limits in section 2.3 of this appendix or whenever any of the quality assurance/quality control parameters are not available.</P>
              <P>2.5.2 Substitute missing NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate data using the highest NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate tabulated during the most recent set of baseline correlation tests for the same fuel or, if applicable, combination of fuels, except as provided in sections 2.5.2.1, 2.5.2.2, 2.5.2.3, and 2.5.2.4 of this appendix.</P>

              <P>2.5.2.1 If the measured heat input rate during any unit operating hour is higher than the highest heat input rate from the baseline correlation tests, the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for the hour is considered to be missing. Provide substitute data for each such hour, according to section 2.5.2.1.1 or 2.5.2.1.2 of this appendix, as applicable. Either:</P>
              <P>2.5.2.1.1 Substitute the higher of: the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate obtained by linear extrapolation of the correlation curve, or the maximum potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (MER) (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter), specific to the type of fuel being combusted. (For fuel mixtures, substitute the highest NO<E T="52">X</E> MER value for any fuel in the mixture.) For units with NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls, the extrapolated NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate may only be used if the controls are documented (e.g., by parametric data) to be operating properly during the missing data period (see section 2.5.2.2 of this appendix); or</P>
              <P>2.5.2.1.2 Substitute 1.25 times the highest NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate from the baseline correlation tests for the fuel (or fuel mixture) being combusted in the unit, not to exceed the MER for that fuel (or mixture). For units with NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls, the option to report 1.25 times the highest emission rate from the correlation curve may only be used if the controls are documented (e.g., by parametric data) to be operating properly during the missing data period (see section 2.5.2.2 of this appendix).</P>
              <P>2.5.2.2 For a unit with add-on NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls (e.g., steam or water injection, selective catalytic reduction), if, for any unit operating hour, the emission controls are either not in operation or if appropriate parametric data are unavailable to ensure proper operation of the controls, the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate for the hour is considered to be missing. Substitute the fuel-specific MER (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) for each such hour.</P>

              <P>2.5.2.3 When emergency fuel (as defined in § 72.2) is combusted in the unit, report the fuel-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> MER for each hour that the fuel is combusted, unless a NO<E T="52">X</E> correlation curve has been derived for the fuel.</P>

              <P>2.5.2.4 Whenever 20 full calendar quarters have elapsed following the quarter of the last baseline correlation test for a particular <PRTPAGE P="444"/>type of fuel (or fuel mixture), without a subsequent baseline correlation test being done for that type of fuel (or fuel mixture), substitute the fuel-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> MER (as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter) for each hour in which that fuel (or mixture) is combusted until a new baseline correlation test for that fuel (or mixture) has been successfully completed. For fuel mixtures, report the highest of the individual MER values for the components of the mixture.</P>

              <P>The procedures in this appendix may be used to estimate CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions discharged to the atmosphere (in tons/day) as the sum of CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions from combustion and, if applicable, CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions from sorbent used in a wet flue gas desulfurization control system, fluidized bed boiler, or other emission controls.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Procedures for Estimating CO<E T="52">2</E> Emissions From Combustion</HD>
              <P>Use the following procedures to estimate daily CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The optional procedure in section 2.3 of this appendix may also be used for an affected gas-fired unit. For an affected unit that combusts any nonfossil fuels (e.g., bark, wood, residue, or refuse), either use a CO<E T="52">2</E> continuous emission monitoring system or apply to the Administrator for approval of a unit-specific method for determining CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions.</P>
              <P>2.1 Use the following equation to calculate daily CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions (in tons/day) from the combustion of fossil fuels. Where fuel flow is measured in a common pipe header (i.e., a pipe carrying fuel for multiple units), the owner or operator may use the procedures in section 2.1.2 of appendix D of this part for combining or apportioning emissions, except that the term “SO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions” is replaced with the term “CO<E T="52">2</E> mass emissions.”</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 76—Procedures and Methods for Estimating Costs of Nitrogen Oxides Controls Applied to Group 1, Boilers</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">1. Purpose and Applicability</HD>

            <P>This technical appendix specifies the procedures, methods, and data that the Administrator will use in establishing “***the degree of reduction achievable through this retrofit application of the best system of continuous emission reduction, taking into account available technology, costs, and energy and environmental impacts; and which is comparable to the costs of nitrogen oxides controls set pursuant to subsection (b)(1) (of section 407 of the Act).” In developing the allowable NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limitations for Group 2 boilers pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of section 407 of the Act, the Administrator will consider only those systems of continuous emission reduction that, when applied on a retrofit basis, are comparable in cost to the cost in constant dollars of low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology applied to Group 1, Phase I boilers.</P>

            <P>The Administrator will evaluate the capital cost (in dollars per kilowatt electrical ($/kW)), the operating and maintenance costs (in $/year), and the cost-effectiveness (in annualized $/ton NO<E T="52">X</E> removed) of installed low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology controls over a range of boiler sizes (as measured by the gross electrical capacity of the associated generator in megawatt electrical (MW)) and utilization rates (in percent gross nameplate capacity on an annual basis) to develop estimates of the capital costs and cost effectiveness for Group 1, Phase I boilers. The following units will be excluded from these determinations of the capital costs and cost effectiveness of NO<E T="52">X</E> controls set pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of section 407 of the Act: (1) Units employing an alternative technology, or overfire air as applied to wall-fired boilers or separated overfire air as applied to tangentially fired boilers, in lieu of low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology for reducing NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions; (2) units employing no controls, only controls installed before November 15, 1990, or only modifications to boiler operating parameters (e.g., burners out of service or fuel switching) for reducing NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions; and (3) units that have not achieved the applicable emission limitation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Average Capital Cost for Low NO<E T="52">X</E> Burner Technology Applied to Group 1 Boilers</HD>

            <P>The Administrator will use the procedures, methods, and data specified in this section to estimate the average capital cost (in $/kW) of installed low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology applied to Group 1 boilers.</P>

            <P>2.1 Using cost data submitted pursuant to the reporting requirements in section 4 below, boiler-specific actual or estimated actual capital costs will be determined for each unit in the population specified in section 1 above for assessing the costs of installed low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology. The scope of installed low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology costs will include the following capital costs for retrofit application: (1) For the burner portion—burners or air and coal nozzles, burner throat and waterwall modifications, and windbox modifications; and, where applicable, (2) for the combustion air staging portion—waterwall modifications or panels, windbox modifications, and ductwork, and (3) scope adders or supplemental equipment such as replacement or additional fans, dampers, or ignitors necessary for the proper operation of the low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology. Capital costs associated with boiler restoration or refurbishment such as replacement of air heaters, asbestos abatement, and recasing will not be included in the cost basis for installed low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology. The scope of installed low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology retrofit capital costs will include materials, construction and installation labor, engineering, and overhead costs.</P>
            <P>2.2 Using gross nameplate capacity (in MW) for each unit as reported in the National Allowance Data Base (NADB), boiler-specific capital costs will be converted to a $/kW basis.</P>

            <P>2.3 Capital cost curves ($/kW versus boiler size in MW) or equations for installed low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology retrofit costs will be developed for: (1) Dry bottom wall fired boilers (excluding units applying cell burner technology) and (2) tangentially fired boilers.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">4. Reporting Requirements</HD>
            <P>4.1 The following information is to be submitted by each designated representative of a Phase I affected unit subject to the reporting requirements of § 76.14(c):</P>

            <P>4.1.1 Schedule and dates for baseline testing, installation, and performance testing of low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology.</P>
            <P>4.1.2 Estimates of the annual average baseline NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as specified in section 3.1.1, and the annual average controlled NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate, as specified in section 3.1.2, including the supporting continuous emission monitoring or other test data.</P>
            <P>4.1.3 Copies of pre-retrofit and post-retrofit performance test reports.</P>

            <P>4.1.4 Detailed estimates of the capital costs based on actual contract bids for each component of the installed low NO<E T="52">X</E> burner technology including the items listed in section 2.1. Indicate number of bids solicited. <PRTPAGE P="485"/>Provide a copy of the actual agreement for the installed technology.</P>

            <P>(a) The Administrator will deduct allowances to offset excess emissions in accordance with the offset plan approved under § 77.4(b) (1) or (k) or in accordance with § 72.91(b) of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(b) The designated representative shall hold enough allowances in the appropriate compliance account to cover <PRTPAGE P="490"/>the deductions to be made in accordance with paragraph (a) or paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) If the designated representative does not submit a timely and complete proposed offset plan, or if the Administrator disapproves a proposed offset plan under § 77.4 (c) or (k), the Administrator will immediately deduct allowances allocated for the year after the year in which the source has excess emissions, from the source's compliance account on a first-in, first-out basis in accordance with § 73.35(c)(2) of this chapter, equal to the amount of the source's excess emissions of sulfur dioxide.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Penalties for excess emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) If excess emissions of sulfur dioxide occur at the affected source or nitrogen oxide occur at an affected unit during any year, the owners and operators respectively of the affected source and the affected units at the source or of the affected unit shall pay, without demand, an excess emissions penalty, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) If one or more affected units governed by an approved NO<E T="52">X</E> averaging plan under § 76.11 of this chapter fail (after applying § 76.11(d)(1)(ii)(C) of this chapter) to meet their respective alternative contemporaneous emission limitations or annual heat input limits, then excess emissions of nitrogen oxides occur during the year at each such unit. The sum of the excess emissions of nitrogen oxides of such units shall equal the amount determined under § 76.13(b) of this chapter. The owners and operators of such units shall pay an excess emissions penalty, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section using the sum of the excess emissions of nitrogen oxides of such units.</P>
            <P>(3) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), payment under paragraphs (a) (1) or (2) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator by 30 days after the date on which the Administrator serves the designated representative a notice that the process of recordation set forth in § 73.34(a) of this chapter is completed or by July 1 of the year after the year in which the excess emissions occurred, whichever date is earlier. Payment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any increase in excess emissions of sulfur dioxide determined after adjustments made under § 72.91(b) of this chapter shall be submitted to the Administrator by 30 days after the date on which the Administrator serves the designated representative a notice that process set forth in § 72.91(b) of this chapter is completed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalty formula.</E> (1) The following formulas shall be used to determine the excess emissions penalty:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Penalty for excess emissions of sulfur dioxide = $2000/ton × annual adjustment factor × tons of excess emissions of sulfur dioxide.</FP>
            
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Penalty for excess emissions of nitrogen oxides = $2000/ton × annual adjustment factor × tons of excess emissions of nitrogen oxides.</FP>
            

            <P>(i) The annual adjustment factor will be calculated as follows:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Annual adjustment factor = 1 + {[CPI(year) − CPI(1990)] / CPI(1990)}</FP>
            
            <FP>where:</FP>
            
            <P>(A) “CPI(year)” is the Consumer Price Index as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter and “year” is the year in which the source or unit as appropriate had excess emissions.</P>

            <P>(B) “CPI(1990)” is the Consumer Price Index for 1990, as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter.
            </P>

            <P>(ii) The Administrator will publish the annual adjustment factor in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by October 15 of each year beginning in 1995.</P>
            <P>(2) The penalty may be rounded to the nearest dollar after completing the calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>

            <P>(3) The penalty for excess emissions of sulfur dioxide shall be paid separately from the payment for excess emissions of nitrogen oxides. Each payment shall be accompanied by a document, in a format prescribed by the Administrator, indicating the source or unit as appropriate for which the payment is made, whether the payment is for excess emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, the number of tons <PRTPAGE P="491"/>of excess emissions, the penalty amount, and the check or money order number of the payment.</P>
            <P>(c) If an excess emissions penalty due under this part is not paid on or before the applicable deadline under paragraph (a) of this section, the penalty shall be subject to interest charges in accordance with the Debt Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3717). Interest shall begin to accrue on the date on which the Administrator mails, to the designated representative of the source or unit as appropriate with excess emissions, a demand notice for the payment.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) Except for wire transfers made in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, payments of penalties shall be made by money order, cashier's check, certified check, or U.S. Treasury check made payable to the “U.S. EPA.”</P>
            <P>(2) Payments made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be mailed to the following address, unless the Administrator has notified the designated representative of a different address: U.S. EPA: Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, Acid Rain Excess Emissions Penalties, P.O. Box 952491, St. Louis, MO 63195-2491.</P>
            <P>(3) Payments of penalties of $25,000 or more may be made by wire transfer to the U.S. Treasury at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Administrator determines that overpayment has been made, he or she will refund the overpayment without interest, as promptly as administratively possible.</P>

            <P>(f) Excess emissions in any year resulting directly from an order issued in that year under section 110(f) of the Act shall not be subject to the penalty payment requirements of this section; <E T="03">provided</E> that the designated representative of any source or unit as appropriate subject to such order shall advise the Administrator within 30 days of issuance of the order that the order will result in such excess emissions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General requirements and provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview of requirements.</E> (1) All manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives that are designated for registration under this part are required to comply with the requirements of subpart F of this part either on an individual basis or as a participant in a group of manufacturers of the same or similar fuels and fuel additives, as defined in § 79.56. If manufacturers elect to comply by participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be individually subject to the requirements of subpart F of this part, and responsible for testing under this subpart. Each manufacturer, subject to the provisions for group applications in § 79.51(b) and the special provisions in § 79.58, shall submit all Tier 1 and Tier 2 information required by §§ 79.52, 79.53 and 79.59 for each fuel or additive, except that the Tier 1 emission characterization requirements in § 79.52(b) and/or the Tier 2 testing requirements in § 79.53 may be satisfied by adequate existing information pursuant to the <PRTPAGE P="517"/>Tier 1 literature search requirements in § 79.52(d). The adequacy of existing information to serve in compliance with specific Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 requirements shall be determined according to the criteria and procedures specified in §§ 79.52(b) and 79.53 (c) and (d). In all cases, EPA reserves the right to require, based upon the information contained in the application or any other information available to the Agency, that manufacturers conduct additional testing of any fuel or additive (or fuel/additive group) if EPA determines that there is inadequate information upon which to base regulatory decisions for such product(s). In any case where EPA determines that the requirements of Tiers 1 and 2 have been satisfied but that further testing is required, the provisions of Tier 3 (§ 79.54) shall apply.</P>
              <P>(2) Laboratory facilities shall perform testing in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements as those requirements apply to inhalation toxicology studies. All studies shall be monitored by the facilities' Quality Assurance units (as specified in § 79.60).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Group Applications.</E> Subject to the provisions of § 79.56 (a) through (c), EPA will consider any testing requirements of this subpart to have been met for any fuel or fuel additive when a fuel or fuel additive which meets the criteria for inclusion in the same group as the subject fuel or fuel additive has met that testing requirement, provided that all fuels and additives must be individually registered as described in § 79.59(b). For purposes of this subpart, a determination of which group contains a particular fuel or additive will be made pursuant to the provisions of § 79.56 (d) and (e). Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be deemed to require a manufacturer to rely on another manufacturer's testing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application Procedures and Dates.</E> Each application submitted in compliance with this subpart shall be signed by the manufacturer of the designated fuel or additive, or by the manufacturer's agent, and shall be submitted to the address and in the format prescribed in § 79.59. A manufacturer who chooses to comply as part of a group pursuant to § 79.56 shall be covered by the group's joint application. Subject to any modifications pursuant to the special provisions in §§ 79.51(f) or 79.58, the schedule for compliance with the requirements of this subpart is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Fuels and fuel additives with existing registrations.</E> (i) The manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive product which, pursuant to subpart B or C of this part, is registered as of May 27, 1994 must submit the additional basic registration data specified in § 79.59(b) before November 28, 1994.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(vi) and (vii) of this section, the manufacturer of such products must also satisfy the requirements and time schedules in either of the following paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section:</P>
              <P>(A) No later than May 27, 1997, all applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements must be submitted to EPA, pursuant to §§ 79.52, 79.53, and 79.59; or</P>
              <P>(B) No later than May 27, 1997, all applicable Tier 1 requirements (pursuant to §§ 79.52 and 79.59), plus evidence of a contract with a qualified laboratory (or other suitable arrangement) for completion of all applicable Tier 2 requirements, must be submitted to EPA. For this purpose, a qualified laboratory is one which can demonstrate the capabilities and credentials specified in § 79.53(c)(1). In addition, by May 26, 2000, all applicable Tier 2 requirements (pursuant to §§ 79.53 and 79.59) must be submitted to EPA.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of such fuels and fuel additives which, pursuant to applicable special provisions in § 79.58, are not subject to Tier 2 requirements, all other requirements (except Tier 3) must be submitted to EPA before May 27, 1997.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the event that Tier 3 testing is also required (under § 79.54), EPA shall determine an appropriate timeline for completion of the additional requirements and shall communicate this schedule to the manufacturer according to the provisions of § 79.54(b).</P>

              <P>(v) The manufacturer may at any time modify an existing fuel registration by submitting a request to EPA to add or delete a bulk additive to the existing registration information for such fuel product, provided that any <PRTPAGE P="518"/>additional additive must be registered by EPA for use in the specific fuel family to which the fuel product belongs. However, the addition or deletion of a bulk additive to a fuel registration may effect the grouping of such registered fuel under the criteria of § 79.56, and thus may effect the testing responsibilities of the fuel manufacturer under this subpart.</P>

              <P>(vi) In regard to atypical fuels or additives in the gasoline and diesel fuel families (pursuant to the specifications in § 79.56(e)(4)(iii)(A) (<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>)):</P>
              <P>(A) All applicable Tier 1 requirements, pursuant to §§ 79.52 and 79.59, must be submitted to EPA by May 27, 1997.</P>

              <P>(B) Tier 2 requirements, pursuant to §§ 79.53 and 79.59, must be satisfied according to the deadlines in either of the following paragraphs (c)(1)(vi)(B) (<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) All applicable Tier 2 requirements shall be submitted to EPA by November 27, 1998; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Evidence of a contract with a qualified laboratory (or other suitable arrangement) for completion of all applicable Tier 2 requirements shall be submitted to EPA by November 27, 1998. For this purpose, a qualified laboratory is one which can demonstrate the capabilities and credentials specified in § 79.53(c)(1). In addition, all applicable Tier 2 requirements must be submitted to EPA by November 27, 2001.</P>

              <P>(vii) In regard to nonbaseline diesel products formulated with mixed alkyl esters of plant and/or animal origin (i.e., “biodiesel” fuels, pursuant to § 79.56(e)(4)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>)):</P>
              <P>(A) All applicable Tier 1 requirements, pursuant to §§ 79.52 and 79.59, must be submitted to EPA by March 17, 1998.</P>

              <P>(B) Tier 2 requirements, pursuant to §§ 79.53 and 79.59, must be satisfied according to the deadlines in either of the following paragraphs (c)(1)(vii)(B) (<E T="03">1</E>) or (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) All applicable Tier 2 requirements shall be submitted to EPA by March 17, 1998; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Evidence of a contract with a qualified laboratory (or other suitable arrangement) for completion of all applicable Tier 2 requirements shall be submitted to EPA by March 17, 1998. For this purpose, a qualified laboratory is one which can demonstrate the capabilities and credentials specified in § 79.53(c)(1). In addition, all applicable Tier 2 requirements must be submitted to EPA by May 27, 2000.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Registrable fuels and fuel additives.</E> (i) A fuel product which is not registered pursuant to subpart B of this part as of May 27, 1994 shall be considered registrable if, under the criteria established by § 79.56, the fuel can be enrolled in the same fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels. A fuel additive product which is not registered for a specific type of fuel pursuant to subpart C of this part as of May 27, 1994 shall be considered registrable for that type of fuel if, under the criteria established by § 79.56, the fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the additive product in the specific type of fuel can be enrolled in the same fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels or bulk fuel additives. For the purpose of this determination, currently registered fuels and bulk additives are those with existing registrations as of the date on which EPA receives the basic registration data (pursuant to § 79.59(b)) for the product in question.</P>
              <P>(ii) A manufacturer seeking to register under subpart B of this part a fuel product which is deemed registrable under this section, or to register under subpart C of this part a fuel additive product for a specific type of fuel for which it is deemed registrable under this section, shall submit the basic registration data (pursuant to § 79.59(b)) for that product as part of the application for registration. If the Administrator determines that the product is registrable under this section, then the Administrator shall promptly register the product, provided that the applicant has satisfied all of the other requirements for registration under subpart B or subpart C of this part, and contingent upon satisfactory submission of required information under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) Registration of a registrable fuel or additive shall be subject to the same requirements and compliance schedule as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this <PRTPAGE P="519"/>section for existing fuels and fuel additives. Accordingly, manufacturers of registrable fuels or additives may be granted and may retain registration for such products only if any applicable and due Tier 1, 2, and 3 requirements have also been satisfied by either the manufacturer of the product or the fuel/additive group to which the product belongs.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">New fuels and fuel additives.</E> A fuel product shall be considered new if it is not registered pursuant to subpart B of this part as of May 27, 1994 and if, under the criteria established by § 79.56, it cannot be enrolled in the same fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels. A fuel additive product shall be considered new with respect to a specific type of fuel if it is not expressly registered for that type of fuel pursuant to subpart C of this part as of May 27, 1994 and if, under the criteria established by § 79.56, the fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the additive product in the specific type of fuel cannot be enrolled in the same fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels or bulk fuel additives. For the purpose of this determination, currently registered fuels and bulk additives are those with existing registrations as of the date on which EPA receives the basic registration data (pursuant to § 79.59(b)) for the product in question. For such new product, the manufacturer must satisfactorily complete all applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements, followed by any Tier 3 testing which the Administrator may require, before registration will be granted.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notifications.</E> Upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittal in compliance with the requirements of this subpart, EPA will notify such manufacturer (or group) that the application has been received and what, if any, information, testing, or retesting is necessary to bring the application into compliance with the requirements of this subpart. EPA intends to provide such notification of receipt in a timely manner for each such application.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Registered fuel and fuel additive notification.</E> (i) The manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel additive product who is notified that the submittal for such product contains adequate information pursuant to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing and reporting requirements (§§ 79.52, 79.53, and 79.59 (a) through (c)) may continue to sell, offer for sale, or introduce into commerce the registered product as permitted by the existing registration for the product under § 79.4.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel additive product is notified that testing or retesting is necessary to bring the Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 submittal into compliance, the continued sale or importation of the product shall be conditional upon satisfactorily completing the requirements within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) EPA intends to notify the manufacturer of the adequacy of the submitted data within two years of EPA's receipt of such data. However, EPA retains the right to require that adequate data be submitted to EPA if, upon subsequent review, EPA finds that the original Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 submittal is not consistent with the requirements of this subpart. If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of the adequacy of the Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data within two years, EPA will not hold the manufacturer liable for penalties for violating this rule for the period beginning when the data was due until the time EPA notifies the manufacturer of the violation.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel additive product is notified (pursuant to § 79.54(b)) that Tier 3 testing is required for its product, then the manufacturer may continue to sell, offer for sale, introduce into commerce the registered product as permitted by the existing registration for the product under § 79.4. However, if the manufacturer fails to complete the specified Tier 3 requirements within the specified time, the registration of the product will be subject to cancellation under § 79.51(f)(6).</P>
              <P>(v) EPA retains the right to require additional Tier 3 testing pursuant to the procedures in § 79.54.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">New fuel and fuel additive notification.</E> (i) Within six months following its receipt of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal for a new product (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section), EPA shall notify the manufacturer of the <PRTPAGE P="520"/>adequacy of such submittal in compliance with the requirements of §§ 79.52, 79.53, and 79.59 (a) through (c).</P>
              <P>(A) If EPA notifies the manufacturer that testing, retesting, or additional information is necessary to bring the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal into compliance, the manufacturer shall remedy all inadequacies and provide Tier 3 data, if required, before EPA shall consider the requirements for registration to have been met for the product in question.</P>
              <P>(B) If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of the adequacy of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal within six months following the submittal, the manufacturer shall be deemed to have satisfactorily completed Tiers 1 and 2.</P>
              <P>(ii) Within six months of the date on which EPA notifies the manufacturer of satisfactory completion of Tiers 1 and 2 for a new product, or within one year of the submittal of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 data (whichever is earlier), EPA shall determine whether additional testing is currently needed under the provisions of Tier 3 and, pursuant to § 79.54(b), shall notify the manufacturer of its determination.</P>
              <P>(A) If the manufacturer of a new fuel or fuel additive product is notified that Tier 3 testing is required for such product, then EPA shall have the authority to withhold registration until the specified Tier 3 requirements have been satisfactorily completed. EPA shall determine whether the Tier 3 requirements have been met, and shall notify the manufacturer of this determination, within one year of receiving the manufacturer's Tier 3 submittal.</P>
              <P>(B) If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of potential Tier 3 requirements within the prescribed timeframe, then additional testing at the Tier 3 level is deemed currently unnecessary and the manufacturer shall be considered to have complied with all current registration requirements for the new fuel or additive product.</P>
              <P>(iii) Upon completion of all current Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 requirements, and submission of an application for registration which includes all of the information and assurances required by § 79.11 or § 79.21, the registration of the new fuel or additive shall be granted, and the registrant may then sell, offer for sale, or introduce into commerce the registered product as permitted by § 79.4.</P>
              <P>(iv) Once the new product becomes registered, EPA reserves the right to require additional Tier 3 testing pursuant to the procedures specified in § 79.54.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Inspection of a testing facility.</E> (1) A testing facility, whether engaged in emissions analysis or health and/or welfare effects testing under the regulations in this subpart, shall permit an authorized employee or duly designated representative of EPA, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, to inspect the facility and to inspect (and in the case of records also to copy) all records and specimens required to be maintained regarding studies to which this subpart applies. The records inspection and copying requirements shall not apply to quality assurance unit records of findings and problems, or to actions recommended and taken, except the EPA may seek production of these records in litigation or informal hearings.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA will not consider reliable for purposes of showing that a test substance does or does not present a risk of injury to health or the environment any data developed by a testing facility or sponsor that refuses to permit inspection in accordance with this section. The determination that a study will not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the sponsor of a required test of any obligation under any applicable statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA.</P>
              <P>(3) Effects of non-compliance. Pursuant to sections 114, 208, and 211(d) of the CAA, it shall be a violation of this section and a violation of 40 CFR part 79, subpart F to deny entry to an authorized employee or duly designated representative of EPA for the purpose of auditing a testing facility or test data.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Penalties and Injunctive Relief.</E> (1) Any person who violates these regulations shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each and every day of the continuance of the violation and the economic benefit or savings resulting from the violation. Action to collect such civil penalties shall be commenced in accordance with paragraph <PRTPAGE P="521"/>(b) of section 205 of the Clean Air Act or assessed in accordance with paragraph (c) of section 205 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7524 (b) and (c).</P>
              <P>(2) Under section 205(b) of the CAA, the Administrator may commence a civil action for violation of this subpart in the district court of the United States for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or in which the defendant resides or has a principal place of business.</P>
              <P>(3) Under section 205(c) of the CAA, the Administrator may assess a civil penalty of $25,000 for each and every day of the continuance of the violation and the economic benefit or savings resulting from the violation, except that the maximum penalty assessment shall not exceed $200,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General shall not be subject to judicial review.</P>
              <P>(4) The Administrator may, upon application by the person against whom any such penalty has been assessed, remit or mitigate, with or without conditions, any such penalty.</P>
              <P>(5) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to compel the furnishing of information and the conduct of tests required by the Administrator under these regulations and to award other appropriate relief. Actions to compel such actions shall be brought by and in the name of the United States. In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Cancellation.</E> (i) The Administrator of EPA may issue a notice of intent to cancel a fuel or fuel additive registration if the Administrator determines that the registrant has failed to submit in a timely manner any data required to maintain registration under this part or under section 211(b) or 211(e) of the Clean Air Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon issuance of a notice of intent to cancel, EPA will forward a copy of the notice to the registrant by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address of record given in the registration, along with an explanation of the reasons for the proposed cancellation.</P>
              <P>(iii) The registrant will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel to submit written comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the proposed cancellation. If the registrant does not respond in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel, the cancellation of the registration shall become final by operation of law and the Administrator shall notify the registrant of such cancellation. If the registrant responds in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel, the Administrator shall review and consider all comments submitted by the registrant before taking final action concerning the proposed cancellation. The registrants' communications should be sent to the following address: Director, Field Operations and Support Division, 6406J—Fuel/Additives Registration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20460.</P>

              <P>(iv) As part of a written response to a notice of intent to cancel, a registrant may request an informal hearing concerning the notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information the registrant wishes to present at such a hearing. If an informal hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the request. If an informal hearing is held, the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether or not the registrant has complied with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the proposed cancellation. If an informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall be informal, and the hearing shall not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, or 557. A verbatim transcript of each informal hearing shall be kept and the Administrator shall consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented at the hearing in making a final <PRTPAGE P="522"/>decision concerning a proposed cancellation.</P>

              <P>(v) If a registrant who has received a notice of intent to cancel submits a timely written response, and the Administrator decides after reviewing the response and the transcript of any informal hearing to cancel the registration, the Administrator shall issue a final cancellation order, forward a copy of the cancellation order to the registrant by certified mail, and promptly publish the cancellation order in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Any cancellation order issued after receipt of a timely written response by the registrant shall become legally effective five days after it is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Modification of Regulation.</E> (1) In special circumstances, a manufacturer subject to the registration requirements of this rule may petition the Administrator to modify the mandatory testing requirements in the test standard for any test required by this rule by application to Director, Field Operations and Support Division, at the address in paragraph (f)(6)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Such request shall be made as soon as the test sponsor is aware that the modification is necessary, but in no event shall the request be made after 30 days following the event which precipitated the request.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon such request, the Administrator may, in circumstances which are outside the control of the manufacturer(s) or his/their agent and which could not have been reasonably foreseen or avoided, modify the mandatory testing requirements in the rule if such requirements are infeasible.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the Administrator determines that such modifications would not significantly alter the scope of the test, EPA will not ask for public comment before approving the modification. The Administrator will notify the test sponsor by certified mail of the response to the request. EPA will place copies of each application and EPA response in the public docket. EPA will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> annually describing such changes which have occurred during the previous year. Until such <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice is published, any modification approved by EPA shall apply only to the person or group who requested the modification; EPA shall state the applicability of each modification in such notice.</P>

              <P>(iv) Where, in EPA's judgment, the requested modification of a test standard would significantly change the scope of the test, EPA will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> requesting comment on the request and proposed modification. However, EPA may approve a requested modification of a test standard without first seeking public comment if necessary to preserve the validity of an ongoing test undertaken in good faith.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Special Requirements for Additives.</E> When an additive is the test subject, the following rules apply:</P>
              <P>(1) All required emission characterization and health effects testing procedures shall be performed on the mixture which results when the additive is combined with the base fuel for the appropriate fuel family (as specified in § 79.55) at the maximum concentration recommended by the additive manufacturer pursuant to § 79.21(d). This combination shall be known as the additive/base fuel mixture.</P>
              <P>(i) The appropriate fuel family to be utilized for the additive/base fuel mixture is the fuel family which contains the specific type(s) of fuel for which the additive is presently registered or for which the manufacturer of the additive is seeking registration.</P>
              <P>(ii) Additives belonging to more than one fuel family.</P>
              <P>(A) If an additive product is registered in two or more fuel families as of May 27, 1994, then the manufacturer of that additive is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing of) the respective additive/base fuel mixtures in compliance with the requirements of this subpart for each fuel family in which the manufacturer wishes to maintain a registration for its additive.</P>

              <P>(B) If a manufacturer is seeking to register such additive in two or more fuel families then, for testing and registration purposes, the additive shall be considered to be a member of each fuel family in which the manufacturer <PRTPAGE P="523"/>is seeking registration. The manufacturer is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing of) the respective additive/base fuel mixture in compliance with the requirements of this subpart for each fuel family in which the manufacturer wishes to obtain a product registration for its additive.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of the methanol fuel family, which contains two base fuels (M100 and M85 base fuels, pursuant to § 79.55(d)), the applicable base fuel is the one which represents the fuel/additive group (specified in § 79.56(e)(4)(i)(C)) containing fuels of which the most gallons are sold annually.</P>
              <P>(iv) Aftermarket additives which are intended by the manufacturer to be added to the fuel tank only at infrequent intervals shall be applied according to the manufacturer's specifications during mileage accumulation, pursuant to § 79.57(c). However, during emission generation and testing, each tankful of fuel used must contain the fuel additive at its maximum recommended level. If the additive manufacturer believes that this maximum treatment rate will cause adverse effects to the test engine and/or that the engine's emissions may be subject to artifacts due to overuse of the additive, then the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for modification of this requirement and related test procedures. Such request must include objective evidence that the modification(s) are needed, along with data demonstrating the maximum concentration of the additive which may actually reach the fuel tanks of vehicles in use.</P>
              <P>(v) Additives produced exclusively for use in #1 diesel fuel shall be tested in the diesel base fuel specified in § 79.55(c), even though that base fuel is formulated with #2 diesel fuel. If a manufacturer is concerned that emissions generated from this combination of fuel and additive are subject to artifacts due to this blending, then that manufacturer may submit a request for a modification in test procedure requirements to the EPA. Any such request must include supporting test results and suggested test modifications.</P>
              <P>(vi) Bulk additives which are used intermittently for the direct purpose of conditioning or treating a fuel during storage or transport, or for treating or maintaining the storage, pipeline, and/or other components of the fuel distribution system itself and not the vehicle/engine for which the fuel is ultimately intended, shall, for purposes of this program, be added to the base fuel at the maximum concentration recommended by the additive manufacturer for treatment of the fuel or distribution system component. However, if the additive manufacturer believes that this treatment rate will cause adverse effects to the test engine and/or that the engine's emissions may be subject to artifacts due to overuse of the additive, then the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for modification of this requirement and related test procedures. Such request must include objective evidence that the modification(s) are needed, along with data demonstrating the maximum concentration of the additive which may actually reach the fuel tanks of vehicles in use.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA shall use emissions speciation and health effects data generated in the analysis of the applicable base fuel as control data for comparison with data generated for the additive/base fuel mixture.</P>
              <P>(i) The base fuel control data may be:</P>
              <P>(A) Generated internally as an experimental control in conjunction with testing done in compliance with registration requirements for a specific additive; or</P>
              <P>(B) Generated externally in the course of testing different additive(s) belonging to the same fuel family, or in the testing of a base fuel serving as representative of the baseline group for the respective fuel family pursuant to § 79.56(e)(4)(i).</P>

              <P>(ii) Control data generated using test equipment (including vehicle model and/or engine, or Evaporative Emissions Generator specifications, as appropriate) and protocols identical or nearly identical to those used in emissions and health effects testing of the subject additive/base fuel mixture would be most relevant for comparison purposes.<PRTPAGE P="524"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) If an additive manufacturer chooses the same vehicle/engine to independently test the base fuel as an experimental control prior to testing the additive/base fuel mixture, then the test vehicle/engine shall undergo two mileage accumulation periods, pursuant to § 79.57(c). The initial mileage accumulation period shall be performed using the base fuel alone. After base fuel testing, and prior to testing of the additive/base fuel mixture, a second mileage accumulation period shall be performed using the additive/base fuel mixture. The procedures outlined in this paragraph shall not preclude a manufacturer from testing a base fuel and the manufacturer's additive/base fuel mixture separately in identical, or nearly identical, vehicles/engines.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Multiple Test Potential for Non-Baseline Products.</E> (1) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a gasoline or diesel product meets criteria for classification as a non-baseline product (pursuant to § 79.56(e)(3)(i)(B) or § 79.56(e)(3)(ii)(B)), then the manufacturer is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing) of a separate formulation for each reported oxygenating compound, specified class of oxygenating compounds, or other substance which defines a separate non-baseline fuel/additive group pursuant to § 79.56(e)(4)(ii)(A) or (B). For each such substance, testing shall be performed on a mixture of the relevant substance in the appropriate base fuel, formulated according to the specifications for the corresponding group representatives in § 79.56(e)(4)(ii).</P>
              <P>(2) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a non- baseline gasoline product contains a range of total oxygenate concentration-in-use which encompasses gasoline formulations with less than 1.5 weight percent oxygen as well as gasoline formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen or more, then the manufacturer is required to test (or participate in applicable group testing of) a baseline gasoline formulation as well as one or more non-baseline gasoline formulations as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a non- baseline diesel product contains a range of total oxygenate concentration-in-use which encompasses diesel formulations with less than 1.0 weight percent oxygen as well as diesel formulations with 1.0 weight percent oxygen or more, then the manufacturer is required to test (or participate in applicable group testing) of a baseline diesel formulation as well as one or more non-baseline diesel formulations as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The presence in a particular oxygenating additive of small amounts of other unintended oxygenate compounds as byproducts of the manufacturing process of the given oxygenating additive does not affect the grouping of that additive and does not create multiple testing responsibilities for manufacturers who blend that additive into fuel.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Multiple Test Potential for Atypical Fuel Formulations.</E> When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a fuel product includes more than one atypical bulk additive product (pursuant to § 79.56(e)(2)(iii)), and when these additives belong to different fuel/additive groups (pursuant to § 79.56(e)(4)(iii)), then:</P>
              <P>(1) When such disparate additive products are for the same purpose-in-use and are not ordinarily used in the fuel simultaneously, the fuel manufacturer shall be responsible for testing (or participating in the group testing of) a separate formulation for each such additive product. Testing related to each additive product shall be performed on a mixture of the additive in the applicable base fuel, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, or by participation in the costs of testing the designated representative of the fuel/additive group to which each separate atypical additive product belongs.</P>

              <P>(2) When the disparate additive products are not for the same purpose-in-use, the fuel manufacturer shall nevertheless be responsible for testing a separate formulation for each such additive product, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, if these additives <PRTPAGE P="525"/>are not ordinarily blended together in the same commercial formulation of the fuel.</P>
              <P>(3) When the disparate additive products are ordinarily blended together in the same commercial formulation of the fuel, then the fuel manufacturer shall be responsible for the testing of a single test formulation containing all such simultaneously used atypical additive products. Alternatively, this responsibility can be satisfied by enrolling such fuel product in a group which includes other fuel or additive products with the same total combination of atypical elements as that occurring in the fuel product in question. If the basic registration data for the subject fuel includes any alternative additives which contain atypical elements not represented in the test formulation, then the fuel manufacturer is also responsible for testing a separate formulation for each such additional disparate additive product.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Emission Control System Testing.</E> If any information submitted in accordance with this subpart or any other information available to EPA shows that a fuel or fuel additive may have a deleterious effect on the performance of any emission control system or device currently in use or which has been developed to a point where in a reasonable time it would be in general use were such effect avoided, EPA may, in its judgment, require testing to determine whether such effects in fact exist. Such testing will be required in accordance with such protocols and schedules as the Administrator shall reasonably require and shall be paid for by the fuel or fuel additive manufacturer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Tier 1.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General Specifications.</E> Tier 1 requires manufacturers of designated fuels or fuel additives (or groups of manufacturers pursuant to § 79.56) to supply to the Administrator the identity and concentration of certain emission products of such fuels or additives and any available information regarding the health and welfare effects of the whole and speciated emissions of such fuels or additives. In addition to any information required under § 79.59 and in conformance with the reporting requirements thereof, manufacturers shall provide, pursuant to the timing provisions of § 79.51(c), the following information.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Emissions Characterization.</E> Manufacturers must provide a characterization of the emission products which are generated by evaporation (if required pursuant to § 79.58(b)) and by combustion of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in a motor vehicle. For this purpose, manufacturers may perform the characterization procedures described in this section or may rely on existing emission characterization data. To be considered adequate in lieu of performing new emission characterization procedures, the data must be the result of tests using the product in question or using a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture meeting the same grouping criteria as the product in question. In addition, the emissions must be generated in a manner reasonably similar to those described in § 79.57, and the characterization procedures must be adequately performed and documented and must give results reasonably comparable to those which would be obtained by performing the procedures described herein. Reports of previous tests must be sufficiently detailed to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, techniques, and conclusions. After the manufacturer's submittal of such data, if EPA finds that the manufacturer has relied upon inadequate test data, then the manufacturer will not be considered to be in compliance until the corresponding tests have been conducted and the results submitted to EPA.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (i) The emissions to be characterized shall be generated, collected, and stored according to the processes described in § 79.57. Characterization of combustion and evaporative emissions shall be performed separately on each emission sample collected during the applicable emission generation procedure.</P>

              <P>(ii) As provided in § 79.57(d), if the emission generation vehicle/engine is ordinarily equipped with an emission aftertreatment device, then all requirements in this section for the characterization of combustion emissions must <PRTPAGE P="526"/>be completed both with and without the aftertreatment device in a functional state. The emissions shall be generated three times (on three different days) without a functional aftertreatment device and, if applicable, three times (on three different days) with a functional aftertreatment device, and each such time shall be analyzed according to the remaining provisions in this paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Measurement of background emissions: It is required that ambient/dilution air be analyzed for levels of background chemical species present at the time of emissions sampling (for both combustion and evaporative emissions) and that sample values be corrected by substracting the concentrations contributed by the ambient/dilution air. Background chemical species measurement/analysis during the FTP is specified in §§ 86.109-94(c)(5) and 86.135-94 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iv) Concentrations of emission products shall be reported either in units of grams per mile (g/mi) or grams per brake-horsepower/hour (g/bhp-hr) (for chassis dynamometer and engine dynamometer test configurations, respectively), as well as in units of weight percent of measured total hydrocarbons.</P>
              <P>(v) Laboratory practice must be of high quality and must be consistent with state-of-the-art methods as presented in current environmental and analytical chemistry literature. Examples of analytical procedures which may be used in conducting the emission characterization/speciation requirements of this section can be found among the references in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Characterization of the combustion emissions shall include, for products in all fuel families (except when expressly noted in this section):</P>
              <P>(i) Determination of the concentration of the basic emissions as follows: total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates. Manufacturers are referred to the vehicle certification procedures in 40 CFR part 86, subparts B and D (§§ 86.101 through 86.145 and §§ 86.301 through 86.348) for guidance on the measurement of the basic emissions of interest to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) Characterization of the vapor phase of combustion emissions, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Determination of the identity and concentration of individual species of hydrocarbon compounds containing 12 or fewer carbon atoms. Such characterization shall begin within 30 minutes after emission collection is completed.</P>
              <P>(B) Determination of the identity and concentration of individual species of aldehyde and ketone compounds containing eight or fewer carbon atoms. Characterization of these emissions captured in cartridges shall be performed within two weeks if the cartridge is stored at room temperature, and one month if the cartridge is stored at 0 °C or less. If the emissions are sampled using the impinger method, the sample must be stored in a capped sample vial at 0 °C or less and characterized within one week.</P>
              <P>(C) Determination of the identity and concentration of individual species of alcohol and ether compounds containing six or fewer carbon atoms, for those fuels and additive/base fuel mixtures which contain alcohol and/or ether compounds containing from one to six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state. For fuel and additive formulations containing alcohols or ethers with more than six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state, alcohol and ether species with that higher number of carbon atoms or less must be identified and measured in the emissions. Such characterization shall begin within four hours after emission collection is completed.</P>
              <P>(iii) Characterization of the semi-volatile and particulate phases of combustion emissions to identify and measure polycyclic aromatic compounds, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Analysis for polycyclic aromatic compounds shall not be conducted at or soon after the start of a recommended engine lubricant change interval.</P>

              <P>(B) Analysis for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, need not be done for any fuels and additives in the <PRTPAGE P="527"/>methane or propane fuel families, nor for fuels and additives in the atypical categories of any other fuel families, pursuant to the definitions of such families and categories in § 79.56.</P>
              <P>(C) Analysis for poly-chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs), specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, is required only for fuels and additives which contain chlorine as an atypical element, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, which requires all individual emission products containing atypical elements to be determined for atypical fuels and additives. However, manufacturers of baseline and nonbaseline fuels and fuel additives in all fuel families, except those in the methane and propane fuel families, are strongly encouraged to conduct these analyses on a voluntary basis.</P>
              <P>(D) The analytical method used to measure species of PAHs and NPAHs should be capable of detecting at least 1 ppm (equivalent to 0.001 microgram (µg) of compound per milligram of organic extract) of these compounds in the extractable organic matter. The concentration of each individual PAH or NPAH compound identified shall be reported in units of microgram per mile or nanograms per brake-horsepower/hour (for chassis dynamometer and engine dynamometer test configurations, respectively). Each compound which is present at 0.001 µg per mile (0.5 nanograms per brake-horsepower/hour) or more must be identified, measured, and reported. The following individual species shall be measured:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) PAHs:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Benzo(<E T="03">a</E>)anthracene;</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) 1-Nitropyrene.</P>
              <P>(E) The analytical method used to measure species and classes of PCDD/PCDFs should be capable of detecting at least 1 part per trillion (ppt) (equivalent to 0.001 picogram (pg) of compound per milligram of organic extract) of these compounds in the extractable organic matter. The concentration of each individual PCDD/PCDF compound identified shall be reported in units of picograms (pg) per mile or picograms per brake-horsepower/hour (for chassis dynamometer and engine dynamometer test configurations, respectively). Each compound which is present at 0.5 pg/mile (0.3 pg/bhp-hr) or more must be identified, measured, and reported.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) With respect to measurement of PCDD/PCDFs only, the liquid extracts from the particulate and semi-volatile emissions fractions may be combined into one sample for analysis.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The manufacturer is referred to 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 23 for a protocol which may be used to identify and measure any potential PCDD/PCDFs which might be present in exhaust emissions from a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The following individual compounds and classes of compounds of PCDD/PCDFs shall be identified and measured:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Individual tetra-chloro-substituted dibenzodioxins (tetra-CDDs);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Individual tetra-chloro-substituted dibenzofurans (tetra-CDFs);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Penta-CDDs and penta-CDFs, as one class;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Hexa-CDDs and hexa-CDFs, as one class;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) Hepta-CDDs and hepta-CDFs as one class; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">vi</E>) Octo-CDDs and octo-CDFs as one class.</P>
              <P>(iv) With respect to all phases (vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate) of combustion emissions generated from those fuels and additive/base fuel mixtures classified in the atypical categories (pursuant to § 79.56), the identity and concentration of individual emission products containing such atypical elements shall also be determined.</P>
              <P>(3) For evaporative fuels and evaporative fuel additives, characterization of the evaporative emissions shall include:</P>

              <P>(i) Determination of the concentration of total hydrocarbons for the applicable vehicle type and class in 40 <PRTPAGE P="528"/>CFR part 86, subpart B (§§ 86.101 through 86.145).</P>
              <P>(ii) Determination of the identity and concentration of individual species of hydrocarbon compounds containing 12 or fewer carbon atoms. Such characterization shall begin within 30 minutes after emission collection is completed.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of those fuels and additive/base fuel mixtures which contain alcohol and/or ether compounds in the uncombusted state, determination of the identity and concentration of individual species of alcohol and ether compounds containing six or fewer carbon atoms. For fuel and additive formulations containing alcohols or ethers with more than six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state, alcohol and ether species with that higher number of carbon atoms or less must be identified and measured in the emissions. Such characterization shall begin within four hours after emission collection is completed.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the case of those fuels and additive/base fuel mixtures which contain atypical elements, determination of the identity and concentration of individual emission products containing such atypical elements.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Laboratory quality control.</E> (i) At a minimum, laboratories performing the procedures specified in this section shall conduct calibration testing of their emissions characterization equipment before each new fuel/additive product test start-up. Known samples representative of the compounds potentially to be found in emissions from the product to be characterized shall be used to calibrate such equipment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Laboratories performing the procedures specified in this section shall agree to permit quality control inspections by EPA, and for this purpose shall admit any EPA Enforcement Officer, upon proper presentation of credentials, to any facility where vehicles are conditioned or where emissions are generated, collected, stored, sampled, or characterized in meeting the requirements of this section. Such laboratory audits may include EPA distribution of “blind” samples for analysis by participating laboratories.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> Subject to the provisions of § 79.53(b) through (d), the combustion emissions of each fuel or fuel additive subject to testing under this subpart must be tested in accordance <PRTPAGE P="530"/>with each of the testing guidelines in §§ 79.60 through 79.68, except that fuels and additives in the methane and propane fuel families (pursuant to § 79.56(e)(1)(v) and (vi)) need not undergo the Salmonella mutagenicity assay in § 79.68). Similarly, subject to the provisions of § 79.53(b) through (d), the evaporative emissions of each designated evaporative fuel and each designated evaporative fuel additive subject to testing under this subpart must be tested according to each of the testing guidelines in §§ 79.60 through 79.67 (excluding § 79.68, <E T="03">Salmonella typhimurium</E> Reverse Mutation Assay).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Manufacturer Determination.</E> Manufacturers shall determine whether the information gathered pursuant to the literature search in § 79.52(d) contains the results of adequately performed and adequately documented previous testing which provides information reasonably comparable to that supplied by the health tests described in §§ 79.62 through 79.68 regarding the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, reproductive/fertility measures, and general toxicity effects of the emissions of the fuel or additive. When manufacturers make an affirmative determination, they need submit only the information gathered pursuant to § 79.52(d) for such tests. EPA maintains final authority in judging whether the information is an adequate substitution in lieu of conducting the associated tests. EPA's determination of the adequacy of existing information shall be guided by the considerations described in paragraph (d) of this section. If EPA finds that the manufacturer has relied upon inadequate test data, then the manufacturer will not be considered to be in compliance until the corresponding tests have been conducted and the results submitted to EPA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Testing.</E> (1) All testing required pursuant to this section must be done in accordance with the procedures, equipment, and facility requirements described in §§ 79.57, 79.60, and 79.61 regarding emissions generation, good laboratory practices, and inhalation exposure testing, respectively, as well as any other requirements described in this subpart. The laboratory conducting the animal studies shall be registered and in good standing with the United States Department of Agriculture and regularly inspected by United States Department of Agriculture veterinarians. In addition, the facility must be accredited by a generally recognized independent organization which sets laboratory animal care standards. Use of inadequate test protocols or substandard laboratory techniques in performing any testing required by this subpart may result in cancellation of all affected registrations.</P>

              <P>(2) Carcinogenic or mutagenic effects in animals from emissions exposures shall be determined pursuant to § 79.64 <E T="03">In vivo</E> Micronucleus Assay, § 79.65 <E T="03">In vivo</E> Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay, and § 79.68 <E T="03">Salmonella typhimurium</E> Reverse Mutation Assay. Teratogenic effects and reproductive toxicity shall be examined pursuant to § 79.63 Fertility Assessment/Teratology. General toxicity and pulmonary effects shall be determined pursuant to § 79.62 Subchronic Toxicity Study with Specific Health Effect Assessments. Neurotoxic effects shall be determined pursuant to § 79.66 Neuropathology Assessment and § 79.67 Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Assay.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">EPA Determination.</E> (1) After submission of all information and testing, EPA in its judgment shall determine whether previously conducted tests relied upon in the registration submission are adequately performed and documented and provide information reasonably comparable to that which would be provided by the tests described herein. Manufacturers' submissions shall be sufficiently detailed to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, techniques, experimental design, statistical analyses, and conclusions. Studies shall be performed using generally accepted scientific principles, good laboratory techniques, and the testing guidelines specified in these regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA shall give appropriate weight when making this determination to the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) The age of the data;</P>

              <P>(ii) The adequacy of documentation of procedures, findings, and conclusions;<PRTPAGE P="531"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The extent to which the testing conforms to generally accepted scientific principles and practices;</P>
              <P>(iv) The type and number of test subjects;</P>

              <P>(v) The number and adequacy of exposure concentrations, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> emission dilutions;</P>
              <P>(vi) The degree to which the tested emissions were generated by procedures and under conditions reasonably comparable to those set forth in § 79.57; and</P>
              <P>(vii) The degree to which the test procedures conform to the testing guidelines set forth in §§ 79.60 through 79.68 and/or furnish information comparable to that provided by such testing.</P>
              <P>(3) The test animals shall be rodents, preferably a strain of rat, and testing shall include all of the endpoints covered in §§ 79.62 through 79.68. All studies shall be properly executed, with appropriate documentation, and in accord with the individual health testing guidelines (§§ 79.60 through 79.68) of this part, e.g., 90-day, 6-hour per day exposure, minimum.</P>

              <P>(4) In general, the data in a manufacturer's registration submittal shall be adequate if the duration of a test's exposure period is at least as long, in days and hours, as the inhalation exposure specified in the related health test guideline(s). Data from tests with shorter exposure durations than those specified in the guidelines may be acceptable if the test results are positive (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> exhibit adverse effects) and/or include a demonstrable concentration-response relationship.</P>
              <P>(5) Data in support of a manufacturer's registration submittal shall directly address the effects of inhalation exposure to the whole evaporative and exhaust emissions of the respective fuel or additive or to the whole evaporative and exhaust emissions of other fuels or additives which satisfy the criteria in § 79.56 for classification into the same group as the subject fuel or fuel additive. Data obtained in the testing of a raw liquid fuel or additive/base fuel mixture or a raw, aerosolized fuel or additive/base fuel mixture shall not be adequate to support a manufacturer's registration submittal. Data from testing of evaporative emissions cannot substitute for test data on combustion emissions. Data from testing of combustion emissions cannot substitute for test data on evaporative emissions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Tier 3.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General Criteria for Requiring Tier 3 Testing.</E> (1) Tier 3 testing shall be required of a manufacturer or group of manufacturers at EPA's discretion when remaining uncertainties as to the significance of observed health effects, welfare effects, and/or emissions exposures from a fuel or fuel/additive mixture interfere with EPA's ability to make reasonable estimates of the potential risks posed by emissions from the fuel or additive products. Tier 3 testing may be conducted either on an individual basis or a group basis. If performed on a group basis, EPA may require either the same representative to be used in Tier 3 testing as was used in Tier 2 testing or may select a different member or members of the group to represent the group in the Tier 3 tests.</P>
              <P>(2) In addition to the criteria specific to particular tests as summarized and detailed in the testing guidelines (§§ 79.62 through 79.68), EPA may consider a number of factors (including, but not limited to):</P>
              <P>(i) The number of positive and negative outcomes related to each endpoint;</P>
              <P>(ii) The identification of concentration-effect relationships;</P>
              <P>(iii) The statistical sensitivity and significance of such studies;</P>
              <P>(iv) The severity of the observed effects (e.g., whether the effects would be likely to lead to incapacitating or irreversible conditions);</P>
              <P>(v) The type and number of species included in the reported tests;</P>
              <P>(vi) The consistency and clarity of apparent mechanisms, target organs, and outcomes;</P>
              <P>(vii) The presence or absence of effective health test control data for base-fuel-only versus additive/base fuel mixture comparisons;</P>
              <P>(viii) The nature and amount of known toxic agents in the emissions stream; and</P>

              <P>(ix) The observation of lesions which specifically implicate inhalation as an important exposure route.<PRTPAGE P="532"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Consideration of exposure.</E> EPA retains discretion to consider, in addition to available toxicity data, any Tier 1 data on potential exposures to emissions from a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels and/or fuel additives) in determining whether to require Tier 3 testing. EPA may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Types and emission rates of speciated emission components;</P>
              <P>(ii) Types and emission rates of combinations of compounds or elements of concern;</P>
              <P>(iii) Historical and/or projected production volumes and market distributions; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Estimated population and/or environmental exposures obtained through extrapolation, modeling, or literature search findings on ambient, occupational, or epidemiological exposures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice.</E> (1) EPA will determine whether Tier 3 testing is necessary upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittal as prescribed under § 79.51(d). If EPA determines on the basis of the Tier 1 and 2 data submission and any other available information that further testing is necessary, EPA will require the responsible manufacturer(s) to conduct testing as described elsewhere in this section. EPA will notify the manufacturer (or group) by certified letter of the purpose and nature of any proposed testing and of the proposed deadline for completing the testing. A copy of the letter will be placed in the public record. EPA will provide the manufacturer a 60-day comment period after the manufacturer's receipt of such notice. EPA may extend the comment period if it appears from the nature of the issues raised that further discussion is warranted. In the event that no comment is received by EPA from the manufacturer (or group) within the comment period, the manufacturer (or group) shall be deemed to have consented to the adoption by EPA of the proposed Tier 3 requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA will issue a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of its intent to require testing under Tier 3 for a particular fuel or additive manufacturer and that a copy of the letter to the manufacturer outlining the Tier 3 testing for that manufacturer is available in the public record for review and comment. The public shall have a minimum of thirty (30) days after the publication of this notice to comment on the proposed Tier 3 testing.</P>

              <P>(3) EPA will include in the public record a copy of any timely comments concerning the proposed Tier 3 testing requirements received from the affected manufacturer or group or from the public, and the responses of EPA to such comments. After reviewing all such comments received, EPA will adopt final Tier 3 requirements by sending a certified letter describing such final requirements to the manufacturer or group. EPA will also issue a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing that it has adopted such final Tier 3 requirements and that a copy of the letter adopting the requirements has been included in the public record.</P>
              <P>(4) Prior to beginning any required Tier 3 testing, the manufacturer shall submit detailed test protocols to EPA for approval. Once EPA has determined the Tier 3 testing requirements and approves the test protocols, any modification to the requirements shall be governed by § 79.51(f).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity Testing.</E> (1) A potential need for Tier 3 carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity testing may be indicated if the results of the <E T="03">In vivo</E> Micronucleus Assay, required under § 79.64, the <E T="03">In vivo</E> Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay, required under § 79.65, the Salmonella mutagenicity assay required under § 79.68, or relevant pathologic findings under § 79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant dose-related positive response as compared with appropriate controls. Alternatively, Tier 3 carcinogenicity testing and/or mutagenicity testing may be required if there are positive outcomes for at least one concentration in two or more of the tests required under §§ 79.64, 79.65, and 79.68.</P>

              <P>(2) The testing for carcinogenicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.3300 or 798.3320, or their equivalents (see suggested references following each health effects testing guideline). The testing for mutagenicity required under this <PRTPAGE P="533"/>paragraph may likewise be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.5195, 798.5500, 798.5955, 798.7100, and/or other suitable equivalent testing (see suggested references following each health effects testing guideline). EPA may supplement or modify guidelines as required to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reproductive and Teratological Effects Testing.</E> (1) A potential need for Tier 3 testing may be indicated if the results of the Fertility Assessment/Teratology study required under § 79.63 or relevant findings under § 79.62 demonstrate, in comparison with appropriate controls, a statistically significant dose-related positive response in one or more of the possible test outcomes. Similarly, Tier 3 testing may be indicated if statistically significant positive results are confined to either sex, or to the fetus as opposed to the pregnant adult.</P>
              <P>(2) The testing for reproductive and teratological effects required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.4700 and/or by performance of a reproductive assay by continuous breeding. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as required to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Neurotoxicity Testing.</E> (1) A potential need for Tier 3 neurotoxicity testing may be indicated if either the results of the Neuropathology Assessment required under § 79.67 shows concentration-related effects in exposed animals or the Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Assay required under § 79.66 demonstrates a statistically significant concentration-related positive response as compared with appropriate controls. Similarly, Tier 3 neurotoxicity testing may be indicated if relevant results under § 79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant positive response in comparison to appropriate controls.</P>
              <P>(2) The testing for neurotoxicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.3260 and 40 CFR part 798 subpart G. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as required to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">General and Pulmonary Toxicity Testing.</E> (1) A potential need for Tier 3 general and/or pulmonary toxicity testing may be indicated if, in comparison with appropriate controls, the results of the Subchronic Toxicity Study, pursuant to § 79.62, demonstrate abnormal gross analysis or histopathological findings (especially as relates to lung pathology from whole-body preserved test animals) or persistence or delayed occurrence of toxic effects beyond the exposure period.</P>
              <P>(2) A potential need for Tier 3 testing with respect to other organ systems or endpoints not addressed by specific Tier 2 tests, e.g., hepatic, renal, or endocrine toxicity, may be demonstrated by findings in the Tier 2 Subchronic Toxicity Study (pursuant to § 79.62) or by findings in the Tier 1 literature search of adverse functional, physiologic, metabolic, or histopathologic effects of fuel or additive emissions to such other organ systems or any other information available to EPA. In addition, findings in the Tier 1 emission characterization of significant levels of a known toxicant to such other organ systems and endpoints may also indicate a need for relevant health effects testing. The testing required under this paragraph may include tests conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.3260 or 798.3320. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as necessary to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern.</P>
              <P>(3) The testing for general/pulmonary toxicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.2450 or 798.3260. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as necessary to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern. Pulmonary function measurements, host defense assays, immunotoxicity tests, cell morphology/morphometry, and/or enzyme assays of lung lavage cells and fluids may be specifically required.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Other Tier 3 Testing.</E> (1) A manufacturer or group may be required to use up-to-date modeling, sampling, <PRTPAGE P="534"/>monitoring, and/or analytic approaches at the Tier 3 level to provide:</P>
              <P>(i) Estimates of exposures to the emission products of a fuel or fuel additive or group of products;</P>
              <P>(ii) The expected atmospheric transformation products of such emissions; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The environmental partitioning of such emissions to the air, soil, water, and biota.</P>
              <P>(2) Additional emission characterization may be required if uncertainty over the identity of chemical species or rate of their emission interferes with reasonable judgments as to the presence and/or concentration of potentially toxic substances in the emissions of a fuel or fuel additive. The required tests may include characterization of additional classes of emissions, the characterization of emissions generated by additional vehicles/engines of various technology mixes (e.g., catalyzed versus non-catalyzed emissions), and/or other more precise analytic procedures for identification or quantification of emissions compounds. Additional emissions testing may also be required to evaluate concerns which may arise regarding the potential effects of a fuel or fuel additive on the performance of emission control equipment.</P>
              <P>(3) A manufacturer or group may be required to conduct biological and/or exposure studies at the Tier 3 level to evaluate directly the potential public welfare or environmental effects of the emissions of a fuel or additive, if significant concerns about such effects arise as a result of EPA's review of the literature search or emission characterization findings in Tier 1 or the results of the toxicological tests in Tier 2.</P>
              <P>(4) With regard to group submittals, Tier 3 studies on a fuel or additive product(s) other than the originally specified group representative may be required if specific differences in the product's composition indicate that its emissions may have different toxicologic properties from those of the original group representative.</P>
              <P>(5) Additional emission characterization and/or toxicologic tests may be required to evaluate the impact of different vehicle, engine, or emission control technologies on the observed composition or health or welfare effects of the emissions of a fuel or additive.</P>
              <P>(6) Toxicological tests on individual emission products may be required.</P>
              <P>(7) Upon review of information submitted for an aerosol product under § 79.58(e), emissions characterization, exposure, and/or toxicologic testing at a Tier 3 level may be required.</P>
              <P>(8) A manufacturer which qualifies for and has elected to use the special provisions for the products of small businesses (pursuant to § 79.58(d)) may be required to conduct emission characterization, exposure, and/or toxicologic studies at the Tier 3 level for such products, as specified in § 79.58(d)(4).</P>
              <P>(9) The examples of potential Tier 3 tests described in this section do not in any way limit EPA's broad discretion and authority under Tier 3.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General Characteristics.</E> (1) The base fuel(s) in each fuel family shall serve as the group representative(s) for the baseline group(s) in each fuel family pursuant to § 79.56. Also, as specified in § 79.51(h)(1), for fuel additives undergoing testing, the designated base fuel for the respective fuel family shall serve as the substrate in which the additive shall be mixed prior to the generation of emissions.</P>
              <P>(2) Base fuels shall contain a limited complement of the additives which are essential for the fuel's production or distribution and/or for the successful operation of the test vehicle/engine throughout the mileage accumulation and emission generation periods. Such additives shall be used at the minimum effective concentration-in-use for the base fuel in question.</P>
              <P>(3) Unless otherwise restricted, the presence of trace contaminants does not preclude the use of a fuel or fuel additive as a component of a base fuel formulation.</P>

              <P>(4) When an additive is the test subject, any additive normally contained in the base fuel which serves the same function as the subject additive shall be removed from the base fuel formulation. For example, if a corrosion inhibitor were the subject of testing and if this additive were to be tested in a base <PRTPAGE P="535"/>fuel which normally contained a corrosion inhibitor, this test additive would replace the corrosion inhibitor normally included as a component of the base fuel.</P>

              <P>(5) Additive components of the methanol, ethanol, methane, and propane base fuels in addition to any such additives included below shall be limited to those recommended by the manufacturers of the vehicles and/or engines used in testing such fuels.

              <SECTNO>§ 79.56</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Fuel and fuel additive grouping system.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives are allowed to satisfy the testing requirements in §§ 79.52, 79.53, and 79.54 and the associated reporting requirements in § 79.59 on an individual or group basis, provided that such products meet the criteria in this section for enrollment in the same fuel/additive group. However, each manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive must individually comply with the notification requirements of § 79.59(b). Further, if a manufacturer elects to comply by participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be individually subject to the information requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The use of the grouping provision to comply with Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing requirements is voluntary. No manufacturer is prohibited from testing and submitting its own data for its own product registration, despite its qualification for membership in a particular group.</P>
              <P>(2) The only groups permitted are those established in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Each manufacturer who chooses to enroll a fuel or fuel additive in a group of similar fuels and fuel additives as designated in this section may satisfy the registration requirements through a group submission of jointly-sponsored testing and analysis conducted on a product which is representative of all products in that group, provided that the group representative is chosen according to the specifications in this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The health effects information submitted by a group shall be considered applicable to all fuels and fuel additives in the group. A fuel or fuel additive manufacturer who has chosen to participate in a group may subsequently choose to perform testing of such fuel or fuel additive on an individual basis; however, until such independent registration information has been received and reviewed by EPA, the information initially submitted by the group on behalf of the manufacturer's fuel or fuel additive shall be considered applicable and valid for that fuel or fuel additive. It could therefore be used to support requirements for further testing under the provisions of Tier 3 or to support regulatory decisions affecting that fuel or fuel additive.</P>
              <P>(2) Manufacturers are responsible for determining the appropriate groups for their products according to the criteria in this section and for enrolling their products into those groups under industry-sponsored or other independent brokering arrangements.</P>
              <P>(3) Manufacturers who enroll a fuel or fuel additive into a group shall share the applicable costs according to appropriate arrangements established by the group. The organization and administration of group functions and the development of cost-sharing arrangements are the responsibility of the participating manufacturers. If manufacturers are unable to agree on fair and equitable cost sharing arrangements and if such dispute is referred by one or more manufacturers to EPA for resolution, then the provisions in § 79.56(c) (1) and (2) shall apply.</P>
              <P>(c) In complying with the registration requirements for a given fuel or fuel additive, notwithstanding the enrollment of such fuel or additive in a group, a manufacturer may make use of available information for any product which conforms to the same grouping criteria as the given product. If, for this purpose, a manufacturer wishes to rely upon the information previously submitted by another manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) for registration of a similar product (or group of products), then the previous submitter is entitled to reimbursement by the manufacturer for an appropriate portion of the applicable costs incurred to obtain and report such information. Such entitlement shall remain in effect for a period of fifteen years following the date on which the original information was submitted. Pursuant to § 79.59(b)(4)(ii), the manufacturer who relies on previously-submitted registration data shall certify to EPA that the original submitter has been notified and that appropriate reimbursement arrangements have been made.</P>

              <P>(1) When private efforts have failed to resolve a dispute about a fair amount or method of cost-sharing or reimbursement for testing costs incurred under this subpart, then any <PRTPAGE P="538"/>party involved in that dispute may initiate a hearing by filing two signed copies of a request for a hearing with a regional office of the American Arbitration Association and mailing a copy of the request to EPA. A copy must also be sent to each person from whom the filing party seeks reimbursement or who seeks reimbursement from that party. The information and fees to be included in the request for hearing are specified in 40 CFR 791.20(b) and (c).</P>
              <P>(2) Additional procedures and requirements governing the hearing process are those specified in 40 CFR 791.22 through 791.50, 791.60, 791.85, and 791.105, excluding 40 CFR 791.39(a)(3) and 791.48(d).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Basis for classification.</E> (1) Rather than segregating fuels and fuel additives into separate groups, the grouping system applies the same grouping criteria and creates a single set of groups applicable both to fuels and fuel additives.</P>
              <P>(2) Fuels shall be classified pursuant to § 79.56(e) into categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives according to the components and characteristics of such fuels in their uncombusted state. The classification of a fuel product must take into account the components of all bulk fuel additives which are listed in the registration application or basic registration data submitted for the fuel product.</P>
              <P>(3) Fuel additives shall be classified pursuant to § 79.56(e) into categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives according to the components and characteristics of the respective uncombusted additive/base fuel mixture pursuant to § 79.51(h)(1).</P>
              <P>(4) In determining the category and group to which a fuel or fuel additive belongs, impurities present in trace amounts shall be ignored unless otherwise noted. Impurities are those substances which are present through contamination or which remain in the fuel or additive naturally after processing is completed.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Reference standards.</E> (i) American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard D 4814-93a, “Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel”, used to define the general characteristics of gasoline fuels (paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)(3) of this section) and ASTM standard D 975-93, “Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils”, used to define the general characteristics of diesel fuels (paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A)(3) of this section) have been incorporated by reference.</P>

              <P>(ii) This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Copies may be inspected at U.S. EPA, OAR, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Grouping criteria.</E> The grouping system is represented by a matrix of three fuel/additive categories within six specified fuel families (see table F94-7, Grouping System for Fuels and Fuel Additives). Each category may include one or more groups. Within each group, a representative may be designated based on the criteria in this section and joint registration information may be developed and submitted for member fuels and fuel additives.<PRTPAGE P="539"/>

              <P>(C) The Atypical Propane category consists of propane fuels and associated additives which contain elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur, or exceed 123 ppm by weight of sulfur.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Fuel/additive groups.</E> Fuel/additive groups are subdivisions of the fuel/additive categories. One or more group(s) are defined within each category in each fuel family according to the presence of differing characteristics in the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. For each group, one formulation (either a base fuel or a member fuel or additive product) is chosen to represent all the member products in the group in any tests required under this subpart. The section which follows describes the fuel/additive groups.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Baseline groups.</E> (A) The Baseline Gasoline category comprises a single group. The gasoline base fuel specified in § 79.55(b) shall serve as the representative of this group.</P>
              <P>(B) The Baseline Diesel category comprises a single group. The diesel base fuel specified in § 79.55(c) shall serve as the representative of this group.</P>
              <P>(C) The Baseline Methanol category includes two groups: M100 and M85. The M100 group consists of methanol-gasoline formulations containing at least 96 percent methanol by volume. These formulations must contain odorants and bitterants (limited in elemental composition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine) for prevention of purposeful or inadvertent consumption. The M100 base fuel specified in § 79.55(d) shall serve as the representative for this group. The M85 group consists of methanol-gasoline formulations containing at least 50 percent by volume but less than 96 percent by volume methanol. The M85 base fuel specified in § 79.55(d) shall serve as the representative of this group.</P>
              <P>(D) The Baseline Ethanol category comprises a single group. The E85 base fuel specified in § 79.55(e) shall serve as the representative of this group.</P>
              <P>(E) The Baseline Methane category comprises a single group. The CNG base fuel specified in § 79.55(f) shall serve as the representative of this group.</P>
              <P>(F) The Baseline Propane category comprises a single group. The LPG base fuel specified in § 79.55(g) shall serve as the representative of this group.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Non-baseline groups</E>—(A) <E T="03">Non-Baseline Gasoline.</E> The Non-Baseline gasoline fuels and associated additives shall sort into groups according to the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For gasoline fuel and additive products which contain 1.5 percent oxygen by weight or more, a separate non-baseline gasoline group shall be defined by each oxygenate compound or methanol/co-solvent blend listed as a component in the registration application or basic registration data of any such fuel or additive.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Examples of oxygenates occurring in non-baseline gasoline formulations include ethanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), dimethyl ether (DME), tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), and any other compound(s) which increase the oxygen content of the gasoline formulation. A separate non-baseline gasoline group is defined for each such oxygenating compound.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Each unique methanol and co-solvent combination (whether one, two, or more additional oxygenate compounds) used in a non-baseline fuel shall also define a separate group. An oxygenate compound used as a co-solvent for methanol in a non-baseline gasoline formulation must be identified as such in its registration. If the oxygenate is not identified as a methanol co-solvent, then the compound shall be regarded by EPA as defining a separate non-baseline gasoline group. Examples of methanol/co-solvent combinations occurring in non-baseline gasoline formulations include methanol/isopropyl alcohol, methanol/butanol, and methanol with alcohols up to C8/octanol (Octamix).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) For each such group, the representative to be used in testing shall <PRTPAGE P="543"/>be a formulation consisting of the gasoline base fuel blended with the relevant oxygenate compound (or methanol/co-solvent combination) in an amount equivalent to the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the oxygenate (or methanol/co-solvent combination) recorded in the basic registration data of any member fuel or additive product. In the event that two or more products in the same group contain the same and highest amount of the oxygenate or methanol/co-solvent blend, then the representative shall be chosen at random for such candidate products.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) An oxygenate compound or methanol/co-solvent combination to be blended with the gasoline base fuel for testing purposes shall be chemical-grade quality, at a minimum, and shall not contain a significant amount of other contaminating oxygenate compounds.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Separate non-baseline gasoline groups shall also be defined for gasoline formulations derived from each particular petroleum source not listed in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)(<E T="03">5</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Such groups may include, but are not limited to, those derived from shale, used oil, waste plastics, and other recycled chemical/petrochemical products.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Pursuant to § 79.51(i), non-baseline gasoline products may belong to more than one fuel/additive group.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Non-Baseline Diesel.</E> The Non-Baseline diesel fuels and associated additives shall sort into groups according to the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For diesel fuel and additive products which contain 1.0 percent or more oxygen by weight in the form of alcohol(s) and/or ether(s):</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) A separate non-baseline diesel group shall be defined by each individual alcohol or ether listed as a component in the registration application or basic registration data of any such fuel or additive.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) For each such group, the representative to be used in testing shall be a formulation consisting of the diesel base fuel blended with the relevant alcohol or ether in an amount equivalent to the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the alcohol or ether recorded in the basic registration data of any member fuel or additive product.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A separate non-baseline diesel group is also defined for each of the following classes of oxygenating compounds: mixed nitroso-compounds; mixed nitro-compounds; mixed alkyl nitrates; mixed alkyl nitrites; peroxides; furans; mixed alkyl esters of plant and/or animal origin (biodiesel). For each such group, the representative to be used in testing shall be formulated as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) From the class of compounds which defines the group, a particular oxygenate compound shall be chosen from among all such compounds recorded in the registration application or basic registration data of any fuel or additive in the group.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The selected compound shall be the one recorded in any member product's registration application with the highest actual or recommended maximum concentration-in-use.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) In the event that two or more oxygenate compounds in the relevant class have the highest recorded concentration-in-use, then the oxygenate compound to be used in the group representative shall be chosen at random from the qualifying candidate compounds.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) The compound thus selected shall be the group representative, and shall be used in testing at the following concentration:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">A</E>) For biodiesel groups, the representative shall be 100 percent biodiesel fuel.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">B</E>) Otherwise, the group representative shall be the selected compound mixed into diesel base fuel at the maximum recommended concentration-in-use.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Separate non-baseline diesel groups shall also be defined for diesel formulations derived from each particular petroleum source not listed in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)(<E T="03">5</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Such groups may include, but are not limited to, those derived from shale, used oil, waste plastics, and other recycled chemical/petrochemical products.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) In any such group, the first product to be registered or to apply for <PRTPAGE P="544"/>EPA registration shall be the representative of that group. If two or more products are registered or apply for first registration simultaneously, then the representative shall be chosen by a random method from among such candidate products.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Pursuant to § 79.51(i), non-baseline diesel products may belong to more than one fuel/additive group.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Non-baseline methanol.</E> The Non-Baseline methanol formulations are sorted into groups based on the non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s) of the blended fuel. Each such component occurring separately and each unique combination of such components shall define a separate group.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The representative of each such non-baseline methanol group shall be the group member with the highest percent by volume of non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In case two or more such members have the same and highest concentration of non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s), the representative of the group shall be chosen at random from among such equivalent member products.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Non-Baseline Ethanol.</E> The Non-Baseline ethanol formulations are sorted into groups based on the non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s) of the blended fuel. Each such component occurring separately and each unique combination of such components shall define a separate group.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The representative of each such non-baseline ethanol group shall be the group member with the highest percent by volume of non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) In case two or more such members have the same and highest concentration of non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s), the representative of the group shall be chosen at random from among such equivalent member products.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Non-Baseline Methane.</E> The Non-Baseline methane category consists of one group. The group representative shall be the member fuel or fuel/additive formulation containing the highest concentration-in-use of non-methane hydrocarbons. If two or more member products have the same and the highest concentration-in-use, then the representative shall be chosen at random from such products.</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Non-baseline propane.</E> The Non-Baseline propane category consists of one group. The group representative shall be the member fuel or fuel/additive formulation containing the highest concentration-in-use of butane and higher hydrocarbons. If two or more products have the same and the highest concentration-in-use, then the representative shall be chosen at random from such products.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Atypical groups.</E> (A) As defined for each individual fuel family in § 79.56(e)(3), fuels and additives meeting any one of the following criteria are considered atypical.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Gasoline Atypical fuels and additives contain one or more elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Diesel Atypical fuels and additives contain one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Methanol Atypical fuels and additives contain:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, and/or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) sulfur in excess of 0.004 percent by weight, and/or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) chlorine in excess of 0.0001 percent by weight.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Ethanol Atypical fuels and additives contain:</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) sulfur in excess of 0.004 percent by weight, and/or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) contain chlorine (as chloride) in excess of 0.0004 percent by weight, and/or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) contain copper in excess of 0.07 mg/L.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Methane Atypical fuels and additives contain:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, and/or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) sulfur in excess of 16 ppm by volume.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Propane Atypical fuels and additives contain:</P>

              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) sulfur in excess of 123 ppm by weight.</P>
              <P>(B) General rules for sorting these atypical fuels and additives into separate groups are as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Pursuant to § 79.51(j), a given atypical product may belong to more than one atypical group.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Fuels and additives in different fuel families may not be grouped together, even if they contain the same atypical element(s) or other atypical characteristic(s).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A fuel or additive containing one or more atypical elements attached to a polymer compound must be sorted into a separate group from atypical fuels or fuel additives containing the same atypical element(s) in non-polymer form. However, the occurrence of a polymer compound which does not contain an atypical element does not affect the grouping of a fuel or additive.</P>
              <P>(C) Specific rules for sorting each family's atypical fuels and additives into separate groups, and for choosing each such group's representative for testing, are as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A separate group is created for each atypical element (or other atypical characteristic) occurring separately, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> in the absence of any other atypical element or characteristic, in one or more fuels and/or additives within a given fuel family.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Consistent with the basic grouping guidelines provided in § 79.56(d), a fuel product which is classified as atypical because its basic registration data or application lists a bulk additive containing an atypical characteristic, may be grouped with that additive and/or with other fuels and additives containing the same atypical characteristic.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Within a group of products containing only one atypical element or characteristic, the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture with the highest concentration-in-use or recommended concentration-in-use of the atypical element or characteristic shall be the designated representative of that group. In the event that two or more fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures within the group contain the same and highest concentration of the single atypical element or characteristic, then the group representative shall be selected by a random method from among such candidate products.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A separate group is also created for each unique combination of atypical elements (and/or other specified atypical characteristics) occurring together in one or more fuels and/or additives within a given fuel family.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Consistent with the basic grouping guidelines provided in § 79.56(d), a fuel which is classified as atypical because its basic registration data lists one bulk additive containing two or more atypical characteristics, may be grouped with that additive and/or with other fuels and/or additives containing the same combination of atypical characteristics. Grouping of fuels containing more than one atypical additive shall be guided by provisions of § 79.51(j).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Within a group of such products containing a unique combination of two or more atypical elements or characteristics, the designated representative shall be the product within the group which contains the highest total concentration of the atypical elements or characteristics.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) In the event that two or more products within a given atypical group contain the same and highest concentration of the same atypical elements or characteristics then, among such candidate products, the designated representative shall be the product which, first, has the highest total concentration of metals, followed in order by highest total concentration of halogens, highest total concentration of other atypical elements (including sulfur concentration, as applicable), highest total concentration of polymers containing atypical elements, and, lastly, highest total concentration of oxygen.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) If two or more products have the same and highest concentration of the variable identified in the preceding paragraph, then, among such products, the one with the greatest concentration of the next highest variable on the list shall be the group representative.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) This decision-making process shall continue until a single product is determined to be the representative. If two or more products remain tied at <PRTPAGE P="546"/>the end of this process, then the representative shall be chosen by a random method from among such remaining products.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 79.57</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Emission generation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This section specifies the equipment and procedures that must be used in generating the emissions which are to be subjected to the characterization procedures and/or the biological tests specified in §§ 79.52(b) and 79.53 of these regulations. When applicable, they may also be required in conjunction with testing under §§ 79.54 and 79.58(c). Additional requirements concerning emission generation, delivery, dilution, quality control, and safety practices are outlined in § 79.61.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Vehicle and engine selection criteria.</E> (1) All vehicles and engines used to generate emissions for testing a fuel or additive/fuel mixture must be new (i.e., never before titled) and placed into the program with less than 500 miles on the odometer or 12 hours on the engine chronometer. The vehicles and engines shall be unaltered from the specifications of the original equipment manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(2) The vehicle/engine type, vehicle/engine class, and vehicle/engine subclass designated to generate emissions for a given fuel or additive shall be the same type, class, and subclass which, over the previous three years, has consumed the most gallons of fuel in the fuel family applicable to the given fuel or additive. No distinction shall be made between light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks for purposes of this classification.</P>
              <P>(3) Within this vehicle/engine type, class, and subclass, the specific vehicles and engines acceptable for emission generation are those that represent the most common fuel metering system and the most common of the most important emission control system devices or characteristics with respect to emission reduction performance for the model year in which testing begins. These vehicles will be determined through a survey of the previous model year's vehicle/engine sales within the given subclass. These characteristics shall include, but need not be limited to, aftertreatment device(s), fuel aspiration, air injection, exhaust gas recirculation, and feedback type.</P>
              <P>(4) Within the applicable subclass, the five highest selling vehicle/engine models that contain the most common such equipment and characteristics shall be determined. Any of these five models of the current model year (at the time testing begins) may be selected for emission generation.</P>
              <P>(i) If one or more of the five models is not available for the current model year, the choice of model for emission generation shall be limited to those remaining among the five.</P>
              <P>(ii) If fewer than five models of the given vehicle/engine type are available for the current model year, all such models shall be eligible.</P>
              <P>(5) When the fuel or fuel additive undergoing testing is not commonly used or intended to be used in the vehicle/engine types prescribed by this selection procedure, or when rebuilding or alteration is required to obtain a suitable vehicle/engine for emission generation, the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for a modification in test procedure requirements. Any such request must include objective test results which support the claim that a more appropriate vehicle/engine type is needed as well as a suggested substitute vehicle/engine type. The vehicle/engine selection in this case shall be approved by EPA prior to the start of testing.</P>
              <P>(6) Once a particular model has been chosen on which to test a fuel or additive product, all mileage accumulation and generation of emissions for characterization and biological testing of such product shall be conducted on that same model.</P>
              <P>(i) If the initial test vehicle/engine fails or must be replaced for any reason, emission generation shall continue with a second vehicle/engine which is identical to, or resembles to the greatest extent possible, the initial test vehicle/engine. If more than one replacement vehicle/engine is necessary, all such vehicles/engines shall be identical, or resemble to the greatest extent possible, the initial test vehicle/engine.</P>

              <P>(ii) Manufacturers are encouraged to obtain, at the start of a test program, <PRTPAGE P="547"/>more than one emission generation vehicle/engine of the identical model, to ensure the availability of back-up emission generator(s). All backup vehicles/engines must be conditioned and must have their emissions fully characterized, as done for the initial test vehicle/engine, prior to their use as emission generators for biological testing. Alternating between such vehicles/engines regularly during the course of testing is permissible and advisable, particularly to allow regular maintenance on such vehicles/engines during prolonged health effects testing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Vehicle/engine operation and maintenance.</E> (1) For the purpose of generating combustion emissions from a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture for which the relevant class is light duty, either a light-duty vehicle shall be operated on a chassis dynamometer or a light-duty engine shall be operated on an engine dynamometer. When the relevant class is heavy duty, the emissions shall be generated on a heavy-duty engine operated on an engine dynamometer. In both cases, the vehicle or engine model shall be selected as described in paragraph (a) of this section and shall have all applicable fuel and emission control systems intact.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in § 79.51(h)(2)(iii), the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture being tested shall be used at all times during operation of the test vehicle or engine. No other fuels or additives shall be used in the test vehicle or engine once mileage accumulation has begun until emission generation for emission characterization and biological testing purposes is completed.</P>
              <P>(i) A vehicle or engine may be used to generate emissions for the testing of more than one fuel or additive, provided that all such fuels and additives belong to the same fuel family pursuant to § 79.56(e)(i), and that, once a vehicle or engine has been used to generate emissions for an atypical fuel or additive (pursuant to § 79.56(e)(2)(iii)), it shall not be used in the testing of any other fuel or additive. Paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section shall apply only to the first fuel or additive tested.</P>
              <P>(ii) Prior to being used to generate emissions for testing an additional fuel or additive, a vehicle or engine which has previously been used for testing a different fuel or additive shall undergo an effective intermediate preconditioning cycle to remove the previously used fuel and its emissions from the vehicle's fuel and exhaust systems and from the combustion emission and evaporative emission control systems, if any.</P>
              <P>(iii) Such preconditioning shall include, at a minimum, the following steps:</P>
              <P>(A) The canister (if any) shall be removed from the vehicle and purged with 300 °F nitrogen at 20 liters per minute until the incremental weight loss of the canister is less than 1 gram in 30 minutes. This typically takes 3-4 hours and removes 100 to 120 grams of adsorbed gasoline vapors.</P>
              <P>(B) The fuel tank shall be drained and filled to capacity with the new test fuel or additive/fuel mixture.</P>
              <P>(C) The vehicle or engine shall be operated until at least 95% of the fuel tank capacity is consumed.</P>
              <P>(D) The purged canister shall be returned to the vehicle.</P>
              <P>(E) The fuel tank shall be drained and filled to 40% capacity with test fuel.</P>
              <P>(F) Two-hour fuel tank heat builds from 72-120 °F shall be performed repeatedly as necessary to achieve canister breakthrough. The fuel tank must be drained and filled prior to each heat build.</P>
              <P>(3) Scheduled and unscheduled vehicle/engine maintenance. (i) During emission generation, vehicles and engines must be maintained in good condition by following the recommendations of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for scheduled service and parts replacement, with repairs performed only as necessary. Modifications, adjustments, and maintenance procedures contrary to procedures found in 40 CFR part 86 for the maintenance of test vehicles/engines or performed solely for the purpose of emissions improvement are not allowed.</P>

              <P>(ii) If unscheduled maintenance becomes necessary, the vehicle or engine must be repaired to OEM specifications, using OEM or OEM-approved parts. In addition, the tester is required to measure the basic emissions <PRTPAGE P="548"/>pursuant to § 79.52(b)(2)(i) after the unscheduled maintenance and before resuming testing to ensure that the post-maintenance emissions shall be within 20 percent of pre-maintenance emissions levels. If the basic emissions cannot be brought within 20 percent of their previous levels, then the manufacturer shall restart the emissions characterization and health testing of its products combustion emissions using a new vehicle/engine.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Mileage accumulation.</E> (1) A vehicle/engine break-in period is required prior to generating emissions for characterization and/or biological testing under this subpart. The required mileage accumulation may be accomplished on a test track, on the street, on a dynamometer, or using any other conventionally accepted method.</P>
              <P>(2) Vehicles to be used in the evaluation of baseline and non-baseline fuels and fuel additives shall accumulate 4,000 miles prior to emission testing. Engines to be used in the evaluation of baseline and non-baseline fuels and fuel additives shall accumulate 125 hours of operation on an engine dynamometer prior to emission testing.</P>
              <P>(3) When the test formulation is classified as an atypical fuel or fuel additive formulation (pursuant to definitions in § 79.56(e)(4)(iii)), the following additional mileage accumulation requirements apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The test vehicle/engine must be operated for a minimum of 4,000 vehicle miles or 125 hours of engine operation.</P>

              <P>(ii) Thereafter, at intervals determined by the tester, all emission fractions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate) shall be sampled and analyzed for the presence and amount of the atypical element(s) and/or other atypical constituents. Pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the sampled emissions must be generated in the absence of an intact aftertreatment device. Immediately before the samples are taken, a brief warmup period (at least ten miles or the engine equivalent) is required.</P>

              <P>(iii) Mileage accumulation shall continue until either 50 percent or more of the mass of each atypical element (or other atypical constituent) entering the engine can be measured in the exhaust emissions (all fractions combined), or the vehicle/engine has accumulated mileage (or hours) equivalent to 40 percent of the average useful life of the applicable vehicle/engine class (pursuant to regulations in 40 CFR part 86). For example, the maximum mileage required for light-duty vehicles is 40 percent of 100,000 miles (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 40,000 miles), while the maximum time of operation for heavy-duty engines is the equivalent of 40 percent of 290,000 miles (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the equivalent in engine hours of 116,000 miles).</P>
              <P>(iv) When either condition in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section has been reached, additional emission characterization and biological testing of the emissions may begin.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of exhaust aftertreatment devices.</E> (1) If the selected test vehicle/engine, as certified by EPA, does not come equipped with an emissions aftertreatment device (such as a catalyst or particulate trap), such device shall not be used in the context of this program.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section for certain specialized additives, the following provisions apply when the test vehicle/engine, as certified by EPA, comes equipped with an emissions aftertreatment device.</P>
              <P>(i) For mileage accumulation:</P>
              <P>(A) When the test formulation does not contain any atypical elements (pursuant to definitions in § 79.56(e)(4)(iii)), an intact aftertreatment device must be used during mileage accumulation.</P>
              <P>(B) When the test formulation does contain atypical elements, then the manufacturer may choose to accumulate the required mileage using a vehicle/engine equipped with either an intact aftertreatment device or with a non-functional aftertreatment device (e.g., a blank catalyst without its catalytic wash coat). In either case, sampling and analysis of emissions for measurement of the mass of the atypical element(s) (as described in § 79.57(c)(3)) must be done on emissions generated with a non-functional (blank) aftertreatment device.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the manufacturer chooses to accumulate mileage without a functional aftertreatment device, and if the manufacturer wishes to do this outside of a laboratory/test track setting, then a <PRTPAGE P="549"/>memorandum of exemption for product testing must be obtained by applying to the Director of the Field Operations and Support Division (see § 79.59(a)(1)).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(ii) For Tier 1 (§ 79.52), the total set of requirements for the characterization of combustion emissions (§ 79.52(b)) must be completed two times, once using emissions generated with the aftertreatment device intact and a second time with the aftertreatment device rendered nonfunctional or replaced with a non-functional aftertreatment device as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) For Tier 2 (§ 79.53), the standard requirements for biological testing of combustion emissions shall be conducted using emissions generated with a non-functioning aftertreatment device as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) For alternative Tier 2 requirements (§ 79.58(c)) or Tier 3 requirements (§ 79.54) which may be prescribed by EPA, the use of functional or nonfunctional aftertreatment devices shall be specified by EPA as part of the test guidelines.</P>
              <P>(v) In the case where an intact aftertreatment device is not in place, all other manufacturer-specified combustion characteristics (e.g., back pressure, residence time, and mixing characteristics) of the altered vehicle/engine shall be retained to the greatest extent possible.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, when the subject of testing is a fuel additive specifically intended to enhance the effectiveness of exhaust aftertreatment devices, the related aftertreatment device may be used on the emission generation vehicle/engine during all mileage accumulation and testing.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Generation of combustion emissions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Generating combustion emissions for emission characterization.</E> (i) Combustion emissions shall be generated according to the exhaust emission portion of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) for the certification of new motor vehicles, found in 40 CFR part 86, subpart B for light-duty vehicles/engines, and subparts D, M and N for heavy-duty vehicles/engines. The Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), pursuant to 40 CFR part 86, appendix I(a), shall apply to light-duty vehicles/engines and the Engine Dynamometer Driving Schedule (EDS), pursuant to 40 CFR part 86, appendix I(f)(2), shall apply to heavy-duty vehicles/engines. The motoring portion of the heavy-duty test cycle may be eliminated, at the manufacturer's option, for the generation of emissions.</P>
              <P>(A) For light-duty engines operated on an engine dynamometer, the tester shall determine the speed-torque equivalencies (“trace”) for its test engine from valid FTP testing performed on a chassis dynamometer, using a test vehicle with an engine identical to that being tested. The test engine must then be operated under these speed and torque specifications to simulate the FTP cycle.</P>
              <P>(B) Special procedures not included in the FTP may be necessary in order to characterize emissions from fuels and fuel additives containing atypical elements or to collect some types of emissions (e.g., particulate emissions from light-duty vehicles/engines, semi-volatile emissions from both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles/engines). Such alterations to the FTP are acceptable.</P>
              <P>(C) For Tier 2 testing, the engines shall operate on repeated bags 2 and 3 of the UDDS or back to back repeats of the heavy-duty transient cycle of the EDS.</P>
              <P>(ii) Pursuant to § 79.52(b)(1)(i) and § 79.57(d)(2)(ii), emission generation and characterization must be repeated three times when the selected vehicle/engine is normally operated without an emissions aftertreatment device and six times when the selected vehicle/engine is normally operated with an emissions aftertreatment device. In the latter case, the emission generation and characterization process shall be repeated three times with the intact aftertreatment device in place and three times with a non-functioning (blank) aftertreatment device in place.</P>

              <P>(iii) From both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles/engines, samples of vapor phase, semi-volatile phase, and particulate phase emissions shall be collected, except that semi-volatile phase, and particulate emissions need not be sampled for fuels and additives in the <PRTPAGE P="550"/>methane and propane families (pursuant to § 79.56(e)(1)(v) and (vi)). The number and type of samples to be collected and separately analyzed during one emission generation/characterization process are as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) In the case of combustion emissions generated from light-duty vehicles/engines, the samples consist of three bags of vapor emissions (one from each segment of the light-duty exhaust emission cycle) plus one sample of particulate-phase emissions and one sample of semi-volatile-phase emissions (collected over all segments of the exhaust emission cycle). If the mass of particulate emissions or semi-volatile emissions obtained during one driving cycle is not sufficient for characterization, up to three driving cycles may be performed and the extracted fractions combined prior to chemical analysis. Particulate-phase emissions shall not be combined with semi-volatile-phase emissions. The test laboratory should focus on the characterization of the limit of detection for particulates and semi-volatile emissions.</P>
              <P>(B) In the case of combustion emissions generated from heavy-duty engines, the samples consist of one sample of each emission phase (vapor, particulate, and semi-volatile) collected over the entire cold-start cycle and a second sample of each such phase collected over the entire hot-start cycle (see 40 CFR 86.334 through 86.342).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Emission collection and storage.</E> (A) Vapor phase emissions shall be collected and stored in Tedlar bags for subsequent chemical analysis. Storage conditions are specified in § 79.52(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(B) Particulate phase emissions shall be collected on a particulate filter (or more than one, if required) using methods described in 40 CFR 86.1301 through 86.1344. These methods, ordinarily applied only to heavy-duty emissions, are to be adapted and used for collection of particulates from light-duty vehicles/engines, as well. The particulate matter may be stored on the filter in a sealed container, or the soluble organic fraction may be extracted and stored in a separate sealed container. Both the particulate and the extract shall be shielded from ultraviolet light and stored at −20 °C or less. Particulate emissions shall be tested no later than six months from the date they were generated.</P>
              <P>(C) Semi-volatile emissions shall be collected immediately downstream from the particulate collection filters using porous polymer resin beds, or their equivalent, designed for their capture. The soluble organic fraction of semi-volatile emissions shall be extracted immediately and tested within six months of being generated. The extract shall be stored in a sealed container which is shielded from ultraviolet light and stored at −20 °C or less.</P>
              <P>(D) Particulate and semi-volatile phase emission collection, handling and extraction methods shall not alter the composition of the collected material, to the extent possible.</P>
              <P>(v) Additional requirements for combustion emission sampling, storage, and characterization are specified in § 79.52(b).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Generating whole combustion emissions for biological testing.</E> (i) Biological tests requiring whole combustion emissions shall be conducted using emissions generated from the test vehicle or engine operated in accordance with general FTP requirements.</P>
              <P>(ii) Light-duty test vehicles/engines shall be repeatedly operated over the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) (or equivalent engine dynamometer trace, per paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section) and heavy-duty test engines shall be repeatedly operated over the Engine Dynamometer Schedule (EDS) (see 40 CFR part 86, appendix I).</P>
              <P>(A) The tolerances of the driving cycle shall be two times those of the Federal Test Procedure and must be met 95 percent of the time.</P>
              <P>(B) The UDDS or EDS shall be repeated as many times as required for the biological test session.</P>

              <P>(C) Light-duty dynamometers shall be calibrated prior to the start of a biological test (40 CFR 86.118-78), verified weekly (40 CFR 86.118-78), and recalibrated as required. Heavy-duty dynamometers shall be calibrated and checked prior to the start of a biological test (40 CFR 86.1318-84), recalibrated every two weeks (40 CFR 86.1318-84(a)) and checked as stated in 40 CFR 86.1318-84(b) and (c).<PRTPAGE P="551"/>
              </P>
              <P>(D) The fuel reservoir for the test vehicle/engine shall be large enough to operate the test vehicle/engine throughout the daily biological exposure period, avoiding the need for refueling during testing.</P>

              <P>(iii) An apparatus to integrate the large concentration swings typical of transient-cycle exhaust is to be used between the source of emissions and the exposure chamber containing the animal test cages(s). The purpose of such apparatus is to decrease the variability of the biological exposure atmosphere and achieve the necessary concentration of CO or NO<E T="52">X</E>, whichever is limiting.</P>
              <P>(A) A large mixing chamber is suggested for this purpose. The mixing chamber would be charged from the CVS at a constant rate determined by the exposure chamber purge rate. Flow to the exposure chamber would begin at the conclusion of the initial transient cycle with the associated mixing chamber charge.</P>
              <P>(B) A potential alternative apparatus is a mini-diluter (see, for example, AIGER/CRADA, February, 1994 in § 79.57(g)).</P>
              <P>(C) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Emission dilution.</E> (A) Dilution air can be pre-dried to lower the relative humidity, thus permitting a lower dilution rate and a higher concentration of hydrocarbons to be achieved without condensation of water vapor.</P>
              <P>(B) These procedures include requirements that the mean exposure concentration in the inhalation test chamber on 90 percent or more of the exposure days shall be controlled as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the species being controlled is hydrocarbon or particulate, the mean exposure concentration must be within 15 percent of the target concentration for the single species being controlled.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For other species, the mean exposure concentration must be within 10 percent of the target concentration for the single species being controlled.</P>

Analysis of the particle size distribution shall also be performed to establish the stability and consistency of particle size distribution in the test exposure.</P>
              <P>(C) After the initial exhaust dilution to preserve the character of the exhaust, the exhaust stream can be further diluted in the mixing chamber (and/or after leaving the chamber) to achieve the desired biological exposure concentrations.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Verification procedures.</E> (A) The entire system used to dilute and transport whole combustion emissions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> from exhaust pipe to outlet in the biological testing chamber) shall be verified before any animal exposures begin, and verified at least weekly during testing. (See procedures at 40 CFR 86.119-90 for light-duty vehicles and § 86.1319-90 for heavy-duty engines.) Verification testing shall be accomplished by introducing a known sample at the end of the vehicle/engine exhaust pipe into the dilution system and measuring the amount exiting the system. For example, an injected hydrocarbon sample could be detected with a gas chromatograph (GC) and flame ionization detector (FID) to determine the recovery factor.</P>

              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Emission exposure quality control.</E> (A) The tester shall incorporate the additional quality assurance and safety procedures outlined in § 79.61(d) to control variability of emissions during the generation of exposure emissions during health effect testing.</P>
              <P>(B) These procedures include requirements that the mean exposure concentration in the inhalation test chamber on 90 percent or more of the exposure days shall be controlled as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the species being controlled is hydrocarbon or particulate, the mean exposure concentration must be within 15 percent of the target concentration for the single species being controlled.</P>

              <P>(C) The testing facility shall allow an audit of its premises, the qualifications, e.g., curriculum vitae, of its staff assigned to testing, and the specimens and records of the testing for registration purposes (as specified in § 79.60).</P>
              <P>(vii) To allow for customary laboratory scheduling and unforeseen problems affecting the combustion emission generation or dilution equipment, biological exposures may be interrupted on limited occasions, as specified in § 79.61(d)(5). Interruptions exceeding these limitations shall cause the affected test(s) to be void. Testers shall be aware of concerns for backup vehicles/engines cited in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Generating particulate and semi-volatile emissions for biological testing.</E> (i) Salmonella mutagenicity testing, pursuant to § 79.68, shall be conducted on extracts of the particulate and semi-volatile emission phases separately. These emissions shall be generated by operating the test vehicle/engine over the appropriate FTP driving schedule (see paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) and collected and analyzed according to methods described in 40 CFR 86.1301 through 1344 (further information on this subject may be found in Perez, <E T="03">et al.</E> CRC Report No. 551, 1987 listed in § 79.57(g)).</P>
              <P>(A) Particulate emissions shall be collected on particulate filters and extracted from the collection equipment for use in biological tests. The number of repetitions of the applicable driving schedule required to collect sufficient quantities of the particulate emissions will vary, depending on the characteristics of the engine, the test fuel, and the requirements of the biological test protocol. The particulate sample may be collected on one or more filters, as necessary.</P>
              <P>(B) Semi-volatile emissions shall be collected immediately downstream from the particulate collection filters using porous polymer resin beds, or their equivalent, designed for their capture. Semi-volatile phase emissions shall be collected on one apparatus. The time spent collecting sufficient quantities of the test substances in emissions samples will vary, depending on the emission characteristics of the engine and fuel or additive/base fuel mixture and on the requirements of the biological test protocol.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Generation of evaporative emissions for characterization and biological testing.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, an evaporative emissions generator shall be used to volatilize samples of a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture for evaporative emissions characterization and biological testing. Emissions shall be collected and sampled using equipment and methods appropriate for use with the compounds being characterized and the requirements of the emission characterization analysis. In the case of potentially explosive test substance concentrations, care must be taken to avoid generating explosive atmospheres. The tester is referred to § 79.61(d)(8) for considerations involving explosivity.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Evaporative Emissions Generator (EEG) Description.</E> An EEG is a fuel tank or vessel to which heat is applied causing a portion of the fuel to evaporate at a desired rate.

              <P>(iv) The size of the evaporation chamber shall be determined by the rate at which evaporative emissions shall be needed in the test animal exposure chambers and the rate at which the fuel or the additive/base fuel mixture evaporates. The rate of evaporative emissions may be adjusted by altering the size of the EEG or by using one or more additional EEG(s). Emission rate modifications shall not be adjusted by temperature control or pressure control.</P>
              <P>(v) The temperature of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the evaporation chamber shall be 130 °F ±5 °F. The vapors shall maintain this temperature up to the point in the system where the vapors are diluted.</P>

The rate of emission generation shall be high enough to supply the biological exposure chamber with sufficient emissions to allow for a minimum of fifteen air changes per exposure chamber per hour. To allow for customary laboratory scheduling and for unforeseen problems with the evaporative emission generation or dilution equipment, biological exposures may be interrupted on limited occasions, as specified in § 79.61(d)(5).

              <P>(1) When EPA intends to require testing in lieu of or in addition to standard Tier 2 health testing, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified letter of the specific tests which EPA is proposing to require in lieu of or in addition to Tier 2, and the proposed schedule for completion and submission of such tests. A copy of the letter will be placed in the public record. EPA intends to send the notification prior to November 27, 1995, or in the case of new fuels and additives (as defined in § 79.51(c)(3)), within 18 months of EPA's receipt of an intent to register such product. However, EPA's notification to the manufacturer (or group) may occur at any time up to EPA's receipt of Tier 2 data for the product(s) in question. EPA will provide the manufacturer with 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice to comment on the tests which EPA is proposing to require and on the proposed schedule. If the manufacturer believes that undue costs or hardships will occur as a result of EPA's delay in providing notification of alternative Tier 2 requirements, then the manufacturer's comments should describe and include evidence of such hardship. In particular, if the standard Tier 2 toxicology testing for the fuel or additive in question has already begun at the time the manufacturer receives EPA's notification of proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements, then EPA shall refrain from requiring alternative Tier 2 tests provided that EPA receives the <PRTPAGE P="555"/>standard Tier 2 data and report (pursuant to § 79.59(c)) within one year of the date on which the toxicology testing began.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA will issue a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing its intent to require special testing in lieu of or in addition to the standard Tier 2 testing for a particular fuel or additive manufacturer or group, and that a copy of the letter to the manufacturer or group describing the proposed alternative Tier 2 testing for that manufacturer or group is available in the public record for review and comment. The public shall have a minimum of 30 days after the publication of this notice to comment on the proposed alternative Tier 2 testing.</P>

              <P>(3) EPA will include in the public record a copy of any timely comments concerning the proposed alternative Tier 2 testing requirements received from the affected manufacturer or group or from the public, and the responses of EPA to such comments. After reviewing all such comments received, EPA may adopt final alternative Tier 2 requirements by sending a certified letter describing such final requirements to the manufacturer or group. In that event, EPA will also issue a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> announcing that it has adopted final alternative Tier 2 requirements and that a copy of the letter adopting the requirements has been included in the public record.</P>
              <P>(4) After EPA's receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittals, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer (or group) regarding the adequacy of the submittal and potential Tier 3 testing requirements according to the same relative time intervals and by the same procedures as specified in § 79.51 (c) and (d) for routine Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittals.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Small Business Provisions.</E> (1) For purposes of these provisions, when subsidiary, divisional, or other complex business arrangements exist, <E T="03">manufacturer</E> is defined as the business entity with ultimate ownership of all related parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches, or other operating units. <E T="03">Total annual sales</E> means the average of the manufacturer's total sales revenue, excluding any revenue which represents the collection of Federal, State, or local excise taxes or sales taxes, in each of the three years prior to such manufacturer's submittal to EPA of the basic registration information pursuant to § 79.59(b)(2) through (b)(5).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Provisions Applicable to Baseline and Non-baseline Products.</E> A manufacturer with total annual sales less than $50 million is not required to meet the requirements of Tier 1 and Tier 2 (specified in §§ 79.52 and 79.53) with regard to such manufacturer's fuel and/or additive products which meet the criteria for inclusion in a Baseline or Non-baseline group pursuant to § 79.56. Upon such manufacturer's satisfactory completion and submittal to EPA of basic registration data specified in § 79.59(b), the manufacturer may request and EPA shall issue a registration for such product, subject to § 79.51(c) and paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Provisions Applicable to Atypical Products.</E> A manufacturer with total annual sales less than $10 million is not required to meet the requirements of Tier 2 (specified in § 79.53) in regard to such manufacturer's fuel and/or additive products which meet the criteria for inclusion in an Atypical group pursuant to § 79.56. Upon such manufacturer's satisfactory completion and submittal to EPA of basic registration data specified in § 79.59(b) and Tier 1 information specified in § 79.52 for an Atypical fuel or additive, the manufacturer may request and EPA shall issue a registration for such product, subject to § 79.51(c) and paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section. Compliance with Tier 1 requirements under this paragraph may be accomplished by the individual manufacturer or as a part of a group pursuant to § 79.56.</P>
              <P>(4) Any registration granted by EPA under the provisions of this section are conditional upon satisfactory completion of any Tier 3 requirements which EPA may subsequently impose pursuant to § 79.54. In such circumstances, the Tier 3 requirements might include (but would not necessarily be limited to) information which would otherwise have been required under the provisions of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2.</P>

              <P>(5) The provisions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section are voluntary <PRTPAGE P="556"/>on the part of qualifying small manufacturers. Such manufacturers may choose to fulfill the standard requirements for their fuels and additives, individually or as a part of a group, rather than satisfying only the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and/or (d)(3) of this section. If a qualifying small manufacturer elects these special provisions rather than the standard requirements for a product, then EPA will generally assume that any additional information submitted by other manufacturers, for fuels and additives meeting the same grouping criteria (under § 79.56) as that of the small manufacturer's product, is pertinent to further testing and/or regulatory decisions that may affect the small manufacturer's product.</P>
              <P>(6) In the case of an additive for which the manufacturer is not required to meet the requirements of Tier 2 pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) A fuel manufacturer which blends such an additive into fuel shall not be required to meet the requirements of Tier 2 with respect to such additive/fuel mixture.</P>
              <P>(ii) An additive manufacturer which blends such an additive with one or more other registered additive products and/or with substances containing only carbon and/or hydrogen shall not be required to meet the requirements of Tier 2 with respect to such additive or additive blend.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Aftermarket Aerosol Additives.</E> (1) To obtain registration for an aftermarket aerosol fuel additive, the manufacturer shall provide existing information in the form of a literature search, a discussion of the potential exposure(s) to such product, and the basic registration data specified in § 79.59(b).</P>
              <P>(2) The literature search shall include existing data on potential health and welfare effects due to exposure to the aerosol product itself and its raw (uncombusted) components. The analysis for potential exposures shall be based on the actual or anticipated production volume and market distribution of the particular aerosol product, and its estimated frequency of use. Other Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements are not routinely required for aerosol products. EPA will review the submitted information and, at EPA's discretion, may require from the manufacturer further information and/or testing under Tier 3 on a case-by-case basis.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Vehicle emissions inhalation exposure guideline.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This guideline provides additional information on methodologies required to conduct health effects tests involving inhalation exposures to vehicle combustion emissions from fuels or fuel/additive mixtures. Where this guideline and the other health effects testing guidelines in 40 CFR 79.62 through 79.68 specify differing values <PRTPAGE P="570"/>for the same test parameter, the specifications in the individual health test guideline shall prevail for that health effect endpoint.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Acute inhalation study</E> means a short-term toxicity test characterized by a single exposure by inhalation over a short period of time (at least 4 hours and less than 24 hours), followed by at least 14 days of observation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Aerodynamic diameter</E> means the diameter of a sphere of unit density that has the same settling velocity as the particle of the test substance. It is used to compare particles of different sizes, densities and shapes, and to predict where in the respiratory tract such particles may be deposited. It applies to the size of aerosol particles.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Chronic inhalation study</E> means a prolonged and repeated exposure by inhalation for the life span of the test animal; technically, two years in the rat.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Concentration</E> means an exposure level. Exposure is expressed as weight or volume of test aerosol/substance per volume of air, usually mg/m<SU>3</SU> or as parts per million (ppm) over a given time period. Micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m<SU>3</SU>) or parts per billion may be appropriate, as well.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Cumulative toxicity</E> means the adverse effects of repeated exposures occurring as a result of prolonged action or increased concentration of the administered test substance or its metabolites in the susceptible tissues.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Inhalable diameter</E> means that aerodynamic diameter of a particle which is considered to be inhalable for the organism. It is used to refer to particles which are capable of being inhaled and may be deposited anywhere within the respiratory tract from the trachea to the alveoli.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD)</E> means the calculated aerodynamic diameter, which divides the particles of an aerosol in half based on the mass of the particles. Fifty percent of the particles in mass will be larger than the median diameter, and fifty percent will be smaller than the median diameter. MMAD describes the particle distribution of any aerosol based on the weight and size of the particles. MMAD and the geometric standard deviation describe the particle-size distribution.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Material safety data sheet (MSDS)</E> means documentation or information on the physical, chemical, and hazardous characteristics of a given chemical, usually provided by the product's manufacturer.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Reynolds number</E> means a dimensionless number that is proportional to the ratio of inertial forces to frictional forces acting on a fluid. It quantitatively provides a measure of whether flow is laminar or turbulent. A fluid traveling through a pipe is fully developed into a laminar flow for a Reynolds number less than 2000, and fully developed into a turbulent flow for a Reynolds number greater than 4000.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Subacute inhalation toxicity</E> means the adverse effects occurring as a result of the repeated daily exposure of experimental animals to a chemical by inhalation for part (less than 10 percent) of a lifespan; generally, less than 90 days.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Subchronic inhalation study</E> means a repeated exposure by inhalation for part (approximately 10 percent) of a life span of the exposed test animal.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Toxic effect</E> means an adverse change in the structure or function of an experimental animal as a result of exposure to a chemical substance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Principles and design criteria of inhalation exposure systems.</E> Proper conduct of inhalation toxicity studies of the emissions of fuels and additive/fuel mixtures requires that the exposure system be designed to ensure the controlled generation of the exposure atmosphere, the adequate dilution of the test emissions, delivery of the diluted exposure atmosphere to the test animals, and use of appropriate exposure chamber systems selected to meet criteria for a given exposure study.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Emissions generation.</E> Emissions shall be generated according to the specifications in 40 CFR 79.57.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Dilution and delivery systems.</E> (i) The delivery system is the means used to transport the emissions from the generation system to the exposure system. The dilution system is generally a component of the delivery system.</P>

              <P>(ii) Dilution provides control of the emissions concentration delivered to <PRTPAGE P="571"/>the exposure system, serving the function of diluting the associated combustion gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and other noxious gases and vapors, to levels that will ensure that there are no significant or measurable responses in the test animals as a result of exposure to the combustion gases. The formation of particle species is strongly dependent on the dilution rate, as well.</P>
              <P>(iii) The engine exhaust system shall connect to the first-stage-dilution section at 90° to the axis of the dilution section. This is then connected to a right angle elbow on the center line of the dilution section. Engine emissions are injected through the elbow so that exhaust flow is concurrent to dilution flow.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Materials.</E> In designing the dilution and delivery systems, the use of plastic, e.g., PVC and similar materials, copper, brass, and aluminum pipe and tubing shall be avoided if there exists a possibility of chemical reaction occurring between emissions and tubing. Stainless steel pipe and tubing is recommended as the best choice for most emission dilution and delivery applications, although glass and teflon may be appropriate, as well.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Flow requirements.</E> (A) Conduit for dilute raw emissions shall be of such dimensions as to provide residence times for the emissions on the order of less than one second to several seconds before the emissions are further diluted and introduced to the test chambers. With the high flow rates in the dilute raw emissions conduit, it will be necessary to sample various portions of the dilute emissions for delivering differing concentrations to the test chambers. The unused portions of the emissions stream are normally exhausted to the atmosphere outside of the exposure facility.</P>

              <P>(B) Dimensions of the dilute raw exhaust conduit shall be such that, at a minimum, the flow Reynolds number is 70,000 or greater (see Mokler, <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1984 in paragraph (f)(13) of this section). This will maintain highly turbulent flow conditions so that there is more complete mixing of the exhaust emissions.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Wall losses.</E> The delivery system shall be designed to minimize wall losses. This can be done by sizing the tubing or pipe to maintain laminar flow of the diluted emissions to the exposure chamber. A flow Reynolds number of 1000-3000 will ensure minimal wall losses. Also, the length of and number and degree of bends in the delivery lines to the exposure chamber system shall be minimized.</P>
              <P>(D) Whole-body exposure vs. nose-only exposure delivery systems. Flow rates through whole-body chamber systems are of the order of 100 liters per minute to 500 liters per minute. Nose-only systems are on the order of less than 50 liters per minute. To maintain laminar flow conditions, the principles described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section apply to both systems.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Dilution requirements.</E> (A) To maintain the water vapor, and dissolved organic compounds, in the raw exhaust emissions stream, a manufacturer/tester will initially dilute one part emissions with a minimum of five parts clean, filtered air (see Hinners, <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1979 in paragraph (f)(11) of this section). Depending on the water vapor content of a particular fuel/additive mixture's combustion emissions and the humidity of the dilution air, initial exhaust dilutions as high as 1:15 or 1:20 may be necessary to maintain the general character of the exhaust as it cools, e.g., M100. At this point, it is expected that the exhaust stream would be further diluted to more appropriate levels for rodent health effects testing.</P>
              <P>(B) A maximum concentration (minimum dilution) of the raw exhaust going into the test animal cages is anticipated to lie in the range between 1:5 and 1:50 exhaust emissions to clean, filtered air. The minimum concentration (maximum dilution) of raw exhaust for health effects testing is anticipated to be in range between 1:100 and 1:150. Individual manufacturers will treat these ranges as approximations only and will determine the optimum range of emission concentrations to elicit effects in Tier 2 health testing for their particular fuel/fuel additive mixture.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exposure chambers.</E> There are two basic types of dynamic inhalation exposure chambers, whole-body chambers and nose-/head-only exposure chambers (see Cheng and Moss, 1989 in paragraph (f)(8) of this section).</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Whole-body chambers.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) The flow rate through a chamber shall be maintained at 15 air changes per hour.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The chambers are usually maintained at a slightly negative pressure (0.5 to 1.5 inch of water) to prevent leakage of test substance into the exposure room.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The exposure chamber shall be designed in such a way as to provide uniform distribution of exposure concentrations in all compartments (see Cheng <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1989 in paragraph (f)(7) of this section).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Animals are housed in separate compartments inside the chamber, where the whole surface area of an animal is exposed to the test material. The spaces required for different animal species shall follow the <E T="03">Guide.</E> In general, the volume of animal bodies occupy less than 5 percent of the chamber volume.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Head/nose-only exposure chambers.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) In head/nose-only exposure chambers, only the head (oronasal) portion of the animal is exposed to the test material.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The chamber volume and flow rates are much less than in the whole-body exposure chambers because the subjects are usually restrained in a tube holder where the animal's breathing can be easily monitored. The head/nose-only exposure chamber is suitable for short-term exposures or when use of a small amount of test material is required.</P>

              <P>(iii) Since whole-body exposure appears to be the least stressful mode of exposure, it is the preferred method. In general, head/nose only exposure, which is sometimes used to avoid concurrent exposure by the dermal or oral routes, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> grooming, is not recommended because of the stress accompanying the restraining of the animals. However, there may be specific instances where it may be more appropriate than whole-body exposure. The tester shall provide justification for its selection.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inhalation exposure procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Animal selection.</E> (i) The rat is the preferred species for vehicle emission inhalation health effects testing. Commonly used laboratory strains shall be used. Any rodent species may be used, but the tester shall provide justification for the choice of that species.</P>
              <P>(ii) Young adult animals, approximately ten weeks of age for the rat, shall be used. At the commencement of the study, the weight variation of animals used shall not exceed ±20 percent of the mean weight for each sex. Animals shall be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups according to their weight.</P>
              <P>(iii) An equal number of male and female rodents shall be used at each concentration level. Situations may arise where use of a single sex may be appropriate. Females, in general, shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant.</P>

              <P>(iv) The number of animals used at each concentration level and in the control group(s) depends on the type of study, number of biological end points used in the toxicity evaluation, the pre-determined sensitivity of detection and power of significance of the study, and the animal species. For an acute study, at least five animals of each sex shall be used in each test group. For both the subacute and subchronic studies, at least 10 rodents of each sex shall be used in each test group. For a chronic study, at least 20 male and 20 female <PRTPAGE P="573"/>rodents shall be used in each test group.</P>
              <P>(A) If interim sacrifices are planned, the number of animals shall be increased by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed during the course of the study.</P>
              <P>(B) For a chronic study, the number of animals at the termination of the study must be adequate for a meaningful and valid statistical evaluation of chronic effects.</P>
              <P>(v) A concurrent control group is required. This group shall be exposed to clean, filtered air under conditions identical to those used for the group exposed to the test atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(vi) The same species/strain shall be used to make comparisons between fuel-only and fuel/additive mixture studies. If another species/strain is used, the tester shall provide justification for its selection.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Animal handling and care.</E> (i) A key element in the conduct of inhalation exposure studies is the proper handling and care of the test animal population. Therefore, the exposure conditions must conform strictly with the conditions for housing and animal care and use set forth in the <E T="03">Guide.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(ii) In whole-body exposure chambers, animals shall be housed in individual caging. The minimum cage size per animal will be in accordance with instructions set forth in the <E T="03">Guide.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(iii) Chambers shall be cleaned and maintained in accordance with recommendations and schedules set forth in the <E T="03">Guide.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(A) Observations shall be made daily with appropriate actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy or refrigeration of animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice of weak or moribund animals). Exposure systems using head/nose-only exposure chambers require no special daily chamber maintenance. Chambers shall be inspected to ensure that they are clean, and that there are no obstructions in the chamber which would restrict air flow to the animals. Whole-body exposure chambers will be inspected on a minimum of twice daily, once before exposures and once after exposures.</P>
              <P>(B) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed, including the time of onset, degree, and duration.</P>
              <P>(C) Cage-side observations shall include, but are not limited to: changes in skin, fur, eye and mucous membranes, respiratory, autonomic, and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity, and behavioral patterns. Particular attention shall be directed to observation of tremors, convulsions, salivation, diarrhea, lethargy, sleep, and coma.</P>

              <P>(iv) Food and water will be withheld from animals for head/nose-only exposure systems. For whole-body-exposure systems, water only may be provided. When the exposure generation system is not operating, food will be available <E T="03">ad libitum.</E> During operation of the generation system, food will be withheld to avoid possible contamination by emissions.</P>
              <P>(v) At the end of the study period, all survivors in the main study population shall be sacrificed. Moribund animals shall be removed and sacrificed when observed.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Concentration levels and selection.</E> (i) In acute and subacute toxicity tests, at least three exposure concentrations and a control group shall be used and spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects and mortality rates. The data shall be sufficient to produce a concentration-response curve and permit an acceptable estimation of the median lethal concentration.</P>
              <P>(ii) In subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, testers shall use at least three different concentration levels, with a control exposure group, to determine a concentration-response relationship. Concentrations shall be spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The concentration-response data may also be sufficient to determine a NOAEL, unless the result of a limit test precludes such findings. The criteria for selecting concentration levels has been published (40 CFR 798.2450 and 798.3260).</P>

              <P>(A) The highest concentration shall result in toxic effects but not produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful evaluation of the study.<PRTPAGE P="574"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) The lowest concentration shall not produce toxic effects which are directly attributable to the test exposure. Where there is a useful estimation of human exposure, the lowest concentration shall exceed this.</P>
              <P>(C) The intermediate concentration level(s) shall produce minimal observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate concentration level is used, the concentrations shall be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic effects.</P>
              <P>(D) In the low, intermediate, and control exposure groups, the incidence of fatalities shall be low to absent, so as not to preclude a meaningful evaluation of the results.</P>
              <P>(4) Exposure chamber environmental conditions. The following environmental conditions in the exposure chamber are critical to the maintenance of the test animals: flow; temperature; relative humidity; lighting; and noise.</P>

              <P>(i) Filtered and conditioned air shall be used during exposure, to dilute the exhaust emissions, and during non- exposure periods to maintain environmental conditions that are free of trace gases, dusts, and microorganisms on the test animals. Twelve to fifteen air changes per hour will be provided at all times to whole-body-exposure chambers. The minimum air flow rate for head/nose-only exposure chambers will be a function of the number of animals and the average minute volume of the animals:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Q<E T="52">minimum</E>(L/min) = 2 × number of animals × average minute volume</FP>
              <FP>(see Cheng and Moss, 1989 in paragraph (f)(8) of this section).</FP>

              <P>(ii) Recommended ranges of temperature for various species are given in the <E T="03">Guide.</E> The recommended temperature ranges will be used for establishing temperature conditions of whole-body- exposure chambers. For rodents in whole-body-exposure chambers, the recommended temperature is 22 °C ±2 °C and for rabbits, it is 20 °C ±3 °C. Temperature ranges have not been established for head/nose-only tubes; however, recommended maximum temperature limits have been established at the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (see Barr, 1988 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section). Maximum temperature for rats and mice in head/nose-only tubes is 23 °C.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Relative humidity.</E> The relative humidity in the chamber air is important for heat balance and shall be maintained between 40 percent and 60 percent, but in certain instances, this may not be practicable. Testers shall follow <E T="03">Guide</E> recommends for a 30 percent to 70 percent relative humidity range for rodents in exposure chambers.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Lighting.</E> Light intensity of 30 foot candles at 3 ft. from the floor of the exposure facility is recommended (see Rao, 1986 in paragraph (f)(16) of this section).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Exposure conditions.</E> Unless precluded by the requirements of a particular test protocol, animal subjects shall be exposed to the test atmosphere based on a nominal 5-day-per-week regimen, subject to the following rules:</P>
              <P>(i) Each daily exposure must be at least 6 hours plus the time necessary to build the chamber atmosphere to 90 percent of the target exposure atmosphere. Interruptions of daily exposures caused by technical difficulties, if infrequent in occurrence and limited in duration, may be made up the same day by adding equivalent exposure time after the technical problem has been corrected and the exposure atmosphere restored to the required level.</P>
              <P>(ii) Normally, no more than two non-exposure days may occur consecutively during the test period. However, if a third consecutive non-exposure day should occur due to circumstances beyond the tester's control, it may be remedied by adding a supplementary exposure day. Federal and other holidays do not constitute such circumstances. Whenever possible, a make-up day should be taken at the first opportunity, i.e., on the next day which would otherwise have been an intentional non-exposure day. If a compensatory day must be scheduled at the end of the standard test period, then it may occur either:</P>
              <P>(A) Immediately following the last standard exposure day, with no intervening non-exposure days; or</P>

              <P>(B) With up to two intervening non-exposure days, provided that no fewer than two consecutive compensatory exposure days are completed before the <PRTPAGE P="575"/>test is terminated and the animals sacrificed.</P>
              <P>(iii) Except as allowed in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, in no case shall there be fewer than four exposure days per week at any time during the test period.</P>
              <P>(iv) A nominal 90-day (13-week) subchronic test period shall include no fewer than 63 total exposure days.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Exposure atmosphere.</E> (i) The exposure atmosphere shall be held as constant as is practicable and must be monitored continuously or intermittently, depending on the method of analysis, to ensure that exposure levels are at the target values or within stated limits during the exposure period. Sampling methodology will be determined based on the type of generation system and the type of exposure chamber system specified for the exposure study.</P>

              <P>(A) Integrated samples of test atmosphere aerosol shall be taken daily during the exposure period from a single representative sample port in the chamber near the breathing zone of the animals. Gas samples shall be taken daily to determine concentrations (ppm) of the major vapor components of the test atmosphere including CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, SO<E T="52">2</E>, and total hydrocarbons.</P>
              <P>(B) To ensure that animals in different locations of the chamber receive a similar exposure atmosphere, distribution of an aerosol or vapor concentration in exposure chambers can be determined without animals during the developmental phase of the study, or it can be determined with animals early in the study. For head/nose-only exposure chambers, it may not be possible to monitor the chamber distribution during the exposure, because the exposure port contains the animal.</P>
              <P>(C) During the development of the emissions generation system, particle size analysis shall be performed to establish the stability of an aerosol concentration with respect to particle size. Over the course of the exposure, analysis shall be conducted as often as is necessary to determine the consistency of particle size distribution.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Chamber rise and fall times.</E> The rise time required for the exposure concentration to reach 90 percent of the stable concentration after the generator is turned on, and the fall time when the chamber concentration decreases to 10 percent of the stable concentration after the generation system is stopped shall be determined in the developmental phase of the study. Time-integrated samples collected for calculating exposure concentrations shall be taken after the rise time. The daily exposure time is exclusive of the rise or the fall time.</P>
              <P>(ii) Instrumentation used for a given study will be determined based on the type of generation system and the type of exposure chamber system specified for the exposure study.</P>
              <P>(A) For exhaust studies, combustion gases shall be sampled by collecting exposure air in bags and then analyzing the collected air sample to determine major components of the combustion gas using gas analyzers. Exposure chambers can also be connected to gas analyzers directly by using sampling lines and switching valves. Samples can be taken more frequently using the latter method. Aerosol instruments, such as photometers, or time-integrated gravimetric determination may be used to determine the stability of any aerosol concentration in the chamber.</P>
              <P>(B) For evaporative emission studies, concentration of fuel vapors can usually be determined by using a gas chromatograph (GC) and/or infrared (IR) spectrometry. Grab samples for intermittent sampling can be taken from the chamber by using bubble samplers with the appropriate solvent to collect the vapors, or by collecting a small volume of air in a syringe. Intermediate or continuous monitoring of the chamber concentration is also possible by connecting the chamber with a GC or IR detector.</P>
              <P>(7) Monitoring chamber environmental conditions may be performed by a computer system or by exposure system operating personnel.</P>

              <P>(i) The flow-metering device used for the exposure chambers must be a continuous monitoring device, and actual flow measurements must be recorded at least every 30 minutes. Accuracy must be ±5 percent of full scale range. Measurement of air flow through the <PRTPAGE P="576"/>exposure chamber may be accomplished using any device that has sufficient range to accurately measure the air flow for the given chamber. Types of flow metering devices include rotameters, orifice meters, venturi meters, critical orifices, and turbinemeters (see Benedict, 1984 in paragraph (f)(4) and Spitzer, 1984 in paragraph (f)(17) of this section).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Pressure.</E> Pressure measurement may be accomplished using manometers, electronic pressure transducers, magnehelics, or similar devices (see Gillum, 1982 in paragraph (f)(10) of this section). Accuracy of the pressure device must be ±5 percent of full scale range. Pressure measurements must be continuous and recorded at least every 30 minutes.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Temperature.</E> The temperature of exposure chambers must be monitored continuously and recorded at least every 30 minutes. Temperature may be measured using thermometers, RTD's, thermocouples, thermistors, or other devices (see Benedict, 1984 in paragraph (f)(4) of this section). It is necessary to incorporate an alarm system into the temperature monitoring system. The exposure operators must be notified by the alarm system when the chamber temperature exceeds 26.7 °C (80 °F). The exposure must be discontinued and emergency procedures enacted to immediately reduce temperatures or remove test animals from high temperature environment when chamber temperatures exceed 29 °C. Accuracy of the temperature monitoring device will be ±1 °C for the temperature range of 20-30 °C.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Relative humidity.</E> The relative humidity of exposure chambers must be monitored continuously and recorded at least every 30 minutes. Relative humidity may be measured using various devices (see Chaddock, 1985 in paragraph (f)(6) of this section).</P>
              <P>(v) Lighting shall be measured quarterly, or once at the beginning, middle, and end of the study for shorter studies.</P>
              <P>(vi) Noise level in the exposure chamber(s) shall be measured quarterly, or once at the beginning, middle, and end of the study for shorter studies.</P>
              <P>(vii) Oxygen content is critical, especially in nose-only chamber systems, and shall be greater than or equal to 19 percent in the test cages. An oxygen sensor shall be located at a single position in the test chamber and a lower alarm limit of 18 percent shall be used to activate an alarm system.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Safety procedures and requirements.</E> In the case of potentially explosive test substance concentrations, care shall be taken to avoid generating explosive atmospheres.</P>
              <P>(i) It is mandatory that the upper explosive limit (UEL) and lower explosive limit (LEL) for the fuel and/or fuel additive(s) that are being tested be determined. These limits can be found in the material safety data sheets (MSDS) for each substance and in various reference texts. The air concentration of the fuel or additive-base fuel mixture in the generation system, dilution/delivery system, and the exposure chamber system shall be calculated to ensure that explosive limits are not present.</P>
              <P>(ii) Storage, handling, and use of fuels or fuel/additive mixtures shall follow guidelines given in 29 CFR 1910.106.</P>
              <P>(iii) Monitoring for carbon monoxide (CO) levels is mandatory for combustion systems. CO shall be continuously monitored in the immediate area of the engine/vehicle system and in the exposure chamber(s).</P>
              <P>(iv) Air samples shall be taken quarterly in the immediate area of the vapor generation system and the exposure chamber system, or once at the beginning, middle, and end of the study for shorter studies. These samples shall be analyzed by methods described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) With the presence of fuels and/or fuel additives, all electrical and electronic equipment must be grounded. Also, the dilution/delivery system and chamber exposure system must be grounded. Guidelines for grounding are given in 29 CFR 1910.304.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Quality control and quality assurance procedures</E>—(i) <E T="03">Standard operating procedures (SOPs).</E> SOPs for exposure operations, sampling instruments, animal handling, and analytical methods shall be written during the developmental phase of the study.<PRTPAGE P="577"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Technicians/operators shall be trained in exposure operation, maintenance, and documentation, as appropriate, and their training shall be documented.</P>
              <P>(iii) Flow meters, sampling instruments, and balances used in the inhalation experiments shall be calibrated with standards during the developmental phase to determine their sensitivity, detection limits, and linearity. During the exposure period, instruments shall be checked for calibration and documented to ensure that each instrument still functions properly.</P>
              <P>(iv) The mean exposure concentration shall be within 10 percent of the target concentration on 90 percent or more of exposure days. The coefficient of variation shall be within 25 percent of target on 90 percent or more of exposure days. For example, a manufacturer might determine a mean exposure concentration of its product's exposure emissions by identifying “marker” compound(s) typical of the emissions of the fuel or fuel/additive mixture under study as a surrogate for the total of individual compounds in those exposure emissions. The manufacturer would note any concentration changes in the level of the “marker” compound(s) in the sample's daily emissions for biological testing.</P>
              <P>(v) The spatial variation of the chamber concentration shall be 10 percent, or less. If a higher spatial variation is observed during the developmental phase, then air mixing in the chamber shall be increased. In any case, animals shall be rotated among the various cages in the exposure chamber(s) to insure each animal's uniform exposure during the study.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Data and reporting.</E> Data shall be summarized in tabular form, showing for each group the number of animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions, the types of lesions, and the percentage of animals displaying each type of lesion.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Treatment of results.</E> All observed results, quantitative and incidental, shall be evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted statistical method may be used; the statistical methods shall be selected during the design of the study.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Evaluation of results.</E> The findings of an inhalation toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of preceding studies and considered in terms of the observed toxic effects and the necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation will include the relationship between the concentration of the test atmosphere and the duration of exposure, and the severity of abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target organs, body weight changes, effects on mortality and any other general or specific toxic effects.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Test conditions.</E> (i) The exposure apparatus shall be described, including:</P>
              <P>(A) The vehicle/engine design and type, the dynamometer, the cooling system, if any, the computer control system, and the dilution system for exhaust emission generation;</P>
              <P>(B) The evaporative emissions generator model, type, or design and its dilution system; and</P>
              <P>(C) Other test conditions, such as the source and quality of mixing air, fuel or fuel/additive mixture used, treatment of exhaust air, design of exposure chamber and the method of housing animals in a test chamber shall be described.</P>
              <P>(ii) The equipment for measuring temperature, humidity, particulate aerosol concentrations and size distribution, gas analyzers, fuel vapor concentrations, chamber distribution, and rise and fall time shall be described.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Daily exposure results.</E> The daily record shall document the date, the start and stop times of the exposure, number of samples taken during the day, daily concentrations determined, calibration of instruments, and problems encountered during the exposure. The daily exposure data shall be signed by the exposure operator and reviewed and signed by the exposure supervisor responsible for the study.</P>

              <P>(4) Exposure data shall be tabulated and presented with mean values and a measure of variability (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> standard deviation), and shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) Airflow rates through the inhalation equipment;</P>
              <P>(ii) Temperature and humidity of air;</P>

              <P>(iii) Chamber concentrations in the chamber breathing zone;<PRTPAGE P="578"/>

              <SUBJECT>Subchronic toxicity study with specific health effect assessments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose</E>—(1) <E T="03">General toxicity.</E> This subchronic inhalation study is designed to determine a concentration-response relationship for potential toxic effects in rats resulting from continuous or repeated inhalation exposure to vehicle/engine emissions over a period of 90 days. A subgroup of perfusion-fixed animals is required, in addition to the main study population, for more exacting organ and tissue histology. This test will provide screening information on target organ toxicities and on concentration levels useful for running chronic studies and establishing exposure criteria. Initial information on effective concentrations/exposures of the test atmosphere may be determined from the literature of previous studies or through concentration range-finding trials prior to starting this study. This health effects screening test is not capable of directly determining those effects which have a long latency period for development (e.g., carcinogenicity and life-shortening), though it may permit the detremination of a no-observed-adverse-effect level, or NOAEL.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific health effects assessments (HEAs).</E> These supplemental studies are designed to determine the potential for reproductive/teratologic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and neurotoxic health effect outcomes from vehicle/engine emission exposures. They are done in combination with the subchronic toxicity study and paragraph (c) of this section or may be done separately as outlined by the appropriate test guideline.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Fertility assessment/teratology.</E> The fertility assessment is an <E T="03">in vivo</E> study designed to provide information on potential health hazards to the fetus arising from the mother's repeated exposure to vehicle/engine emissions before and during her pregnancy. By including a mating of test animals, the study provides preliminary data on the effects of repeated vehicle/engine emissions exposure on gonadal function, conception, and fertility. The fertility assessment/teratology guideline is found in § 79.63.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Micronucleus (MN) Assay.</E> The MN assay is an <E T="03">in vivo</E> cytogenetic test which gives information on potential carcinogenic and/or mutagenic effects of exposure to vehicle/engine emissions. The MN assay detects damage to the chromosomes or mitotic apparatus of cells in the tissues of a test subject exposed repeatedly to vehicle/engine emissions. The assay is based on an increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes found in bone marrow from treated animals compared to that of control animals. The guideline for the MN assay is found in § 79.64.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE) Assay.</E> The SCE assay is an <E T="03">in vivo</E> analysis which gives information on potential mutagenic and/or carcinogenic effects of exposure to vehicle/engine emissions. The assay detects the ability of a chemical to enhance the exchange of DNA between two sister chromatids of a duplicating chromosome. This assay uses peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from an exposed rodent test species and grown to confluence in cell culture. The guideline for the SCE assay is found in § 79.65.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Neurotoxicity (NTX) measures.</E> NTX measures include (A) histopathology of specified central and peripheral nervous system tissues taken from emission-exposed rodents, and (B) an assay of brain tissue levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a major filament protein of astrocytes, from emission-exposed rodents. The guidelines for the neurohistopathology and GFAP studies are found in § 79.66 and § 79.67, respectively.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:<PRTPAGE P="580"/>
              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">No-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL)</E> means the maximum concentration used in a test which produces no observed adverse effects. A NOAEL is expressed in terms of weight or volume of test substance given daily per unit volume of air (µg/L or ppm).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Subchronic inhalation toxicity</E> means the adverse effects occurring as a result of the continuous or repeated daily exposure of experimental animals to a chemical by inhalation for part (approximately 10 percent) of a life span.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Principle of the test method.</E> As long as none of the requirements of any study are violated by the combination, one or more HEAs may be combined with the general toxicity study through concurrent exposures of their study populations and/or by sharing the analysis of the same animal subjects. Requirements duplicated in combined studies need not be repeated. Guidelines for combining HEAs with the general toxicity study are as follows.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Fertility assessment.</E> (i) The number of study animals in the test population is increased when the fertility assessment is run concurrently with the 90-day toxicity study. A minimum of 40 females per test group shall undergo vaginal lavage daily for two weeks before the start of the exposure period. The resulting wet smears are examined to cull those animals which are acyclic. Twenty-five females shall be randomly assigned to a for-breeding group with the balance of females assigned to a group for histopathologic examination.</P>
              <P>(ii) All test groups are exposed over a period of 90 days to various concentrations of the test atmosphere for a minimum of six hours per day. After seven weeks of exposures, analysis of vaginal cell smears shall resume on a daily basis for the 25 for-breeding females and shall continue for a period of four weeks or until each female in the group is confirmed pregnant. Following the ninth week of exposures, each for-breeding female is housed overnight with a single study male. Matings shall continue for as long as two weeks, or until pregnancy is confirmed (pregnancy day 0). Pregnant females are only exposed through day 15 of their pregnancy while daily exposures continue throughout the course of the study for non-pregnant females and study males.</P>
              <P>(iii) On pregnancy day 20, pregnant females are sacrificed and their uteri are examined. Pregnancy status and fetal effects are recorded as described in § 79.63. At the end of the exposure period, all males and non-pregnant females are sacrificed and necropsied. Testes and epididymal tissue samples are taken from five perfusion-fixed test subjects and histopathological examinations are carried out on the remainder of the non-pregnant females and study males.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Carcinogenicity/mutagenicity(C/M) assessment.</E> When combined with the subchronic toxicity study, the main study population is used to perform both the <E T="03">in vivo</E> MN and SCE assays. Because of the constant turnover of the cells to be analyzed in these assays, a separate study population may be used for this assessment. A study population needs only to be exposed a minimum of four weeks. At exposure's end, ten animals per exposure and control groups are anaesthetized and heart punctures are performed on all members. After separating blood components, individual lymphocyte cell cultures are set up for SCE analysis. One femur from each study subject is also removed and the marrow extracted. The marrow is smeared onto a glass slide, and stained for analysis of micronuclei in erythrocytes.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Neurotoxicity (NTX) measures.</E> (i) When combined with this subchronic toxicity study, test animals designated for whole-body perfusion fixation/lung histology and exposed as part of the main animal population are used to perform the neurohistology portion of these measures. After the last exposure period, a minimum of ten animals from each exposure group shall be preserved <E T="03">in situ</E> with fixative. Sections of brain, spinal cord, and proximal sciatic or tibial nerve are then cut, processed further in formalin, and mounted for viewing under a light microscope. Fibers from the sciatic or tibial nerve sample are teased apart for further analysis under the microscope.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">GFAP assay.</E> After the last exposure period, a minimum of ten rodents <PRTPAGE P="581"/>from each exposure group shall be sacrificed, and their brains excised and divided into regions. The tissue samples are then applied to filter paper, washed with anti-GFAP antibody, and visualized with a radio-labelled Protein A. The filters are quantified for degree of immunoreactivity between the antibody and GFAP in the tissue samples. A non-radioactive ELISA format is also referenced in the GFAP guideline cited in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section. Note: Because the GFAP assay requires fresh, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> non-preserved, brain tissue, the number of test animals may need to be increased to provide an adequate number of test subjects to complete the histopathology requirements of both the GFAP and the general toxicity portion of the 90-day inhalation study.</P>
              <P>(iii) The start of the exposure period for the NTX measures study population may be staggered from that of the main study group to more evenly distribute the analytical work required in both study populations. The exposures would remain the same in all other respects.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Test procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Animal selection</E>—(i) <E T="03">Species and sex.</E> The rat is the recommended species. If another rodent species is used, the tester shall provide justification for its selection. Both sexes shall be used in any assessment unless it is demonstrated that one sex is refractory to the effects of exposure.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Age and number.</E> Rats shall be at least ten weeks of age at the beginning of the study exposure. The number of animals necessary for individual health effect outcomes is as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Thirty rodents per concentration level/group, fifteen of each sex, shall be used to satisfy the reporting requirements of the 90-day toxicity study. Ten animals per concentration level/group shall be designated for whole body perfusion with fixative (by gravity) for lung studies, and neurohistology and testes studies, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(B) Thirty-five rodents, 25 females and ten males, shall be added for each test concentration or control group when combining a 90-day toxicity study with a fertility assessment.</P>
              <P>(C) The tester shall provide a group of 10 animals (five animals per sex per experimental/control groups) in addition to the main test population when performing the GFAP neurotoxicity HEA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Recovery group.</E> The manufacturer shall include a group of 20 animals (10 animals per sex) in the test population, exposing them to the highest concentration level for the entire length of the study's exposure period. This group shall then be observed for reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic effects during a post-exposure period of not less than 28 days.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inhalation exposure.</E> (i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under § 79.60.</P>
              <P>(ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure guideline in § 79.61.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Observation of animals.</E> (i) All toxicological (e.g., weight loss) and neurological signs (e.g., motor disturbance) shall be recorded frequently enough to observe any abnormality, and not less than weekly for all study animals. Animals shall be weighed weekly.</P>
              <P>(ii) The following is a minimal list of measures that shall be noted:</P>
              <P>(A) Body weight;</P>
              <P>(B) Subject's reactivity to general stimuli such as removal from the cage or handling;</P>
              <P>(C) Description, incidence, and severity of any convulsions, tremors, or abnormal motor movements in the home cage;</P>
              <P>(D) Descriptions and incidence of posture and gait abnormalities observed in the home cage;</P>
              <P>(E) Description and incidence of any unusual or abnormal behaviors, excessive or repetitive actions (stereotypies), emaciation, dehydration, hypotonia or hypertonia, altered fur appearance, red or crusty deposits around the eyes, nose, or mouth, and any other observations that may facilitate interpretation of the data.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any animal which dies during the test is necropsied as soon as possible after discovery.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Clinical examinations.</E> (i) The following examinations shall be performed on the twenty animals designated as the 90-day study population, exclusive of pregnant dams and those <PRTPAGE P="582"/>study animals targeted for perfusion by gravity:</P>
              <P>(A) The following hematology determinations shall be carried out at least two times during the test period (after 30 days of exposure and just prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the exposure period): hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure of clotting potential such as prothrombin time, thromboplastin time, or platelet count.</P>
              <P>(B) Clinical biochemistry determinations on blood shall be carried out at least two times during the test period, after 30 days of exposure and just prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the exposure period, on all groups of animals including concurrent controls. Clinical biochemical testing shall include assessment of electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and liver and kidney function. The selection of specific tests will be influenced by observations on the mode of action of the substance. In the absence of more specific tests, the following determinations may be made: calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potassium, fasting glucose (with period of fasting appropriate to the species), serum alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumen, blood creatinine, methemoglobin, bile acids, total bilirubin, and total serum protein measurements. Additional clinical biochemistry shall be employed, where necessary, to extend the investigation of observed effects, e.g., analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base balance, and cholinesterase activity.</P>
              <P>(ii) The following examinations shall initially be performed on the high concentration and control groups only:</P>
              <P>(A) Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope or equivalent suitable equipment, shall be made prior to exposure to the test substance and at the termination of the study. If changes in the eyes are detected, all animals shall be examined.</P>
              <P>(B) Urinalysis is not required on a routine basis, but shall be done when there is an indication based on expected and/or observed toxicity.</P>
              <P>(iii) Preservation by whole-body perfusion of fixative into the anaesthetized animal for lung histology of ten animals from the 90-day study population for each experimental and control group.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Gross pathology.</E> With the exception of the whole body perfusion-fixed test animals cited in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, all rodents shall be subjected to a full gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the body, all orifices and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their contents. Gross pathology shall be performed on the following organs and tissues:</P>
              <P>(i) The liver, kidneys, lungs, adrenals, brain, and gonads, including uterus, ovaries, testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles (with coagulating glands), and prostate, constitute the group of target organs for histology and shall be weighed as soon as possible after dissection to avoid drying. In addition, for other than rodent test species, the thyroid with parathyroids, when present, shall also be weighed as soon as possible after dissection to avoid drying.</P>

              <P>(ii) The following organs and tissues, or representative samples thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future histopathological examination: All gross lesions; lungs—which shall be removed intact, weighed, and treated with a suitable fixative to ensure that lung structure is maintained (perfusion with the fixative is considered to be an effective procedure); nasopharyngeal tissues; brain—including sections of medulla/pons, cerebellar cortex, and cerebral cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; trachea; heart; sternum with bone marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; kidneys; adrenals; pancreas; reproductive organs: uterus; cervix; ovaries; vagina; testes; epididymides; prostate; and, if present, seminal vesicles; aorta; (skin); gall bladder (if present); esophagus; stomach; duodenum; jejunum; ileum; cecum; colon; rectum; urinary bladder; representative lymph node; (mammary gland); (thigh musculature); peripheral nerve/tissue; (eyes); (femur—including articular surface); (spinal cord at three <PRTPAGE P="583"/>levels—cervical, midthoracic, and lumbar); and (zymbal and exorbital lachrymal glands).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fertility assessment/teratology.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Fertility assessment/teratology is an <E T="03">in vivo</E> study designed to provide information on potential health hazards to the fetus arising from the mother's repeated inhalation exposure to vehicle/engine emissions before and during her pregnancy. By including a mating of test animals, the study provides preliminary data on the effects of repeated vehicle/engine emissions exposure on gonadal function, conception, and fertility. Since this is a one-generation test that ends with examination of full-term fetuses, but not of live pups, it is not capable of determining effects on reproductive development which would only be detected in viable offspring of treated parents.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Developmental toxicity</E> means the ability of an agent to induce <E T="03">in utero</E> death, structural or functional abnormalities, or growth retardation after contact with the pregnant animal.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Estrous cycle</E> means the periodic recurrence of the biological phases of the female reproductive system which prepare the animal for conception and the development of offspring. The phases of the estrous cycle for a particular animal can be characterized by the general condition of the cells present in <PRTPAGE P="584"/>the vagina and the presence or absence of various cell types.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Vaginal cytology evaluation</E> means the use of wet vaginal cell smears to determine the phase of a test animal's estrous cycle and the potential for adverse exposure effects on the regularity of the animal's cycle. In the rat, common cell types found in the smears correlate well with the various stages of the estrous cycle and to changes occurring in the reproductive tract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Principle of the test method.</E> (1) For a two week period before exposures start, daily vaginal cell smears are examined from a surplus of female test animals to identify and cull those females which are acyclic. After culling, testers shall randomly assign at each exposure concentration (including unexposed) a minimum of twenty-five females for breeding and fifteen non-bred females for later histologic evaluation. Test animals shall be exposed by inhalation to graduated concentrations of the test atmosphere for a minimum of six hours per day over the next 13 weeks. Males and females in both test and control groups are mated after nine weeks of exposure. Exposures for pregnant females continue through gestation day 15, while exposures for males and all non-pregnant females shall continue for the full exposure period.</P>

              <P>(2) Beginning two weeks before the start of the mating period, daily vaginal smears resume for all to-be-bred females to characterize their estrous cycles. This will continue for four weeks or until a rat's pregnancy is confirmed, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> day 0, by the presence of sperm in the cell smear. On pregnancy day 20, shortly before the expected date of delivery, each pregnant female is sacrificed, her uterus removed, and the contents examined for embryonic or fetal deaths, and live fetuses. At the end of the exposure period, males and all non-pregnant females shall be weighed, and various organs and tissues, as appropriate, shall be removed and weighed, fixed with stain, and sectioned for viewing under a light microscope.</P>
              <P>(3) This assay may be done separately or in combination with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions in § 79.62.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limit test.</E> If a test at one dose level of the highest concentration that can be achieved while maintaining a particle size distribution with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 4 micrometers (µm) or less, using the procedures described in section 79.60 of this part produces no observable toxic effects and if toxicity would not be expected based upon data of structurally related compounds, then a full study using three dose levels might not be necessary. Expected human exposure though may indicate the need for a higher dose level.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Test procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Animal selection</E>—(i) <E T="03">Species and strain.</E> The rat is the preferred species. Strains with low fecundity shall not be used and the candidate species shall be characterized for its sensitivity to developmental toxins. If another rodent species is used, the tester shall provide justification for its selection.</P>
              <P>(ii) Animals shall be a minimum of 10 weeks old at the start of the exposure period.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Number and sex.</E> Each test and control group shall have a minimum of 25 males and 40 females. In order to ensure that sufficient pups are produced to permit meaningful evaluation of the potential developmental toxicity of the test substance, twenty pregnant test animals are required for each exposure and control level.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Observation period.</E> The observation period shall be 13 weeks, at a minimum.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Concentration levels and concentration selection.</E> (i) To select the appropriate concentration levels, a pilot or trial study may be advisable. Since pregnant animals have an increased minute ventilation as compared to non-pregnant animals, it is recommended that the trial study be conducted in pregnant animals. Similarly, since presumably the minute ventilation will vary with progression of pregnancy, the animals should be exposed during the same period of gestation as in the main study. It is not always necessary, though, to carry out a trial study in pregnant animals. Comparisons between the results of a trial study in non-pregnant animals, and the main study in pregnant animals will demonstrate whether or not the test <PRTPAGE P="585"/>substance is more toxic in pregnant animals. In the trial study, the concentration producing embryonic or fetal lethalities or maternal toxicity should be determined.</P>
              <P>(ii) The highest concentration level shall induce some overt maternal toxicity such as reduced body weight or body weight gain, but not more than 10 percent maternal deaths.</P>
              <P>(iii) The lowest concentration level shall not produce any grossly observable evidence of either maternal or developmental toxicity.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Inhalation exposure.</E> (i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under § 79.60.</P>
              <P>(ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure guideline in § 79.61.</P>
              <P>(iii) Pregnant females shall be exposed to the test atmosphere on each and every day between (and including) the first and fifteenth day of gestation.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Test performance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Study conduct.</E> Directions specific to this study are:</P>
              <P>(i) The duration of exposure shall be at least six hours daily, allowing appropriate additional time for chamber equilibrium.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where an exposure chamber is used, its design shall minimize crowding of the test animals. This is best accomplished by individual caging.</P>
              <P>(iii) Pregnant animals shall not be subjected to beyond the minimum amount of stress. Since whole-body exposure appears to be the least stressful mode of exposure, it is the preferred method. In general oronasal or head-only exposure, which is sometimes used to avoid concurrent exposure by the dermal or oral routes, is not recommended because of the associated stress accompanying the restraining of the animals. However, there may be specific instances where it may be more appropriate than whole-body exposure. The tester shall provide justification/reasoning for its selection.</P>
              <P>(iv) Measurements shall be made at least every other day of food consumption for all animals in the study. Males and females shall be weighed on the first day of exposure and 2-3 times per week thereafter, except for pregnant dams.</P>
              <P>(v) The test animal housing, mating, and exposure chambers shall be operated on a twenty-four hour lighting schedule, with twelve hours of light and twelve hours of darkness. Test animal exposure shall only occur during the light portion of the cycle.</P>
              <P>(vi) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed including the time of onset, degree, and duration.</P>
              <P>(vii) Females showing signs of abortion or premature delivery shall be sacrificed and subjected to a thorough macroscopic examination.</P>
              <P>(viii) Animals that die or are euthanized because of morbidity will be necropsied promptly.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Vaginal cytology.</E> (i) For a two week period before the mating period starts, each female in the to-be-bred population shall undergo a daily saline vaginal lavage. Two wet cell smears from this lavage shall be examined daily for each subject to determine a baseline pattern of estrus. Testers shall avoid excessive handling and roughness in obtaining the vaginal cell samples, as this may induce a condition of pseudo-pregnancy in the test animals.</P>
              <P>(ii) This will continue for four weeks or until day 0 of a rat's pregnancy is confirmed by the presence of sperm in the cell smear.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Mating and fertility assessment.</E> (i) Beginning nine weeks after the start of exposure, each exposed and control group female (exclusive of the histology group females) shall be paired during non-exposure hours with a male from the same exposure concentration group. Matings shall continue for a period of two weeks, or until all mated females are determined to be pregnant. Mating pairs shall be clearly identified.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each morning, including weekends, cages shall be examined for the presence of a sperm plug. When found, this shall mark gestation day 0 and pregnancy shall be confirmed by the presence of sperm in the day's wet vaginal cell smears.</P>

              <P>(iii) Two weeks after mating is begun, or as females are determined to be pregnant, bred animals are returned to pre-mating housing. Daily exposures continues through gestation day 15 for all pregnant females or through the <PRTPAGE P="586"/>balance of the exposure period for non-pregnant females and all males.</P>
              <P>(iv) Those pairs which fail to mate shall be evaluated in the course of the study to determine the cause of the apparent infertility. This may involve such procedures as additional opportunities to mate with a proven fertile partner, histological examination of the reproductive organs, and, in males, examination of the spermatogenic cycles. The stage of estrus for each non-pregnant female in the breeding group will be determined at the end of the exposure period.</P>
              <P>(4) All animals in the histology group shall be subject to histopathologic examination at the end of the study's exposure period.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Treatment of results.</E> (1) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, shall be evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. The specific methods, including consideration of statistical power, shall be selected during the design of the study.</P>
              <P>(2) Data and reporting. In addition to the reporting requirements specified under §§ 79.60 and 79.61, the final test report must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Gross necropsy.</E> (A) All animals shall be subjected to a full necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the body, all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their contents. Special attention shall be directed to the organs of the reproductive system.</P>
              <P>(B) The liver, kidneys, adrenals, pituitary, uterus, vagina, ovaries, testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles (with coagulating glands), and prostate shall be weighed wet, as soon as possible after dissection, to avoid drying.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) At the time of sacrifice on gestation day 20 or at death during the study, each dam shall be examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes which may have influenced the pregnancy.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The contents of the uterus shall be examined for embryonic or fetal deaths and the number of viable fetuses. Gravid uterine weights need not be obtained from dead animals where decomposition has occurred. The degree of resorption shall be described in order to help estimate the relative time of death.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The number of corpora lutea shall be determined in each pregnant dam.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Each fetus shall be weighed, all weights recorded, and mean fetal weights determined.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) Each fetus shall be examined externally and the sex determined.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">vi</E>) One-half of the rat fetuses in each litter shall be examined for skeletal anomalies, and the remaining half shall be examined for soft tissue anomalies, using appropriate methods.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Histopathology.</E> (A) Histopathology on vagina, uterus, ovaries, testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles, and prostate as appropriate for all males and histology group females in the control and high concentration groups and for all animals that died or were euthanized during the study. If abnormalities or equivocal results are seen in any of these organs/tissues, the same organ/tissue from test animals in lower concentration groups shall be examined.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>Testes, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and ovaries, at a minimum, shall be examined in perfusion-fixed (pressure or gravity method) test subjects, when available.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(B) All gross lesions in all study animals shall be examined.</P>
              <P>(C) As noted under mating procedures, reproductive organs of animals suspected of infertility shall be subject to microscopic examination.</P>
              <P>(D) The following organs and tissues, or representative samples thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for future histopathological examination: all gross lesions; vagina; uterus; ovaries; testes; epididymides; seminal vesicles; prostate; liver; and kidneys/adrenals.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Evaluation of results.</E> (i) The findings of a developmental toxicity study shall be evaluated in terms of the observed effects and the exposure levels producing effects. It is necessary to consider the historical developmental toxicity data on the species/strain tested.<PRTPAGE P="587"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) There are several criteria for determining a positive result for reproductive/teratologic effects; a statistically significant dose-related decrease in the weight of the testes for treated subjects over control subjects, a decrease in neonatal viability, a significant change in the presence of soft tissue or skeletal abnormalities, or an increased rate of embryonic or fetal resorption or death. Other criteria, e.g., lengthening of the estrous cycle or the time spent in any one stage of estrus, changes in the proportion of viable male vs female fetuses or offspring, the number and type of cells in vaginal smears, or pathologic changes found during gross or microscopic examination of male or female reproductive organs may be based upon detection of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for that evaluation parameter. A positive result indicates that, under the test conditions, the test substance does induce reproductive organ or fetal toxicity in the test species.</P>
              <P>(iii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically significant dose-related change in the reproductive organs or cycle or a statistically significant and reproducible positive response at any one of the test points may not induce reproductive organ toxicity in this test species, but further investigation , e.g., to establish absorption and bioavailability of the test substance, should be considered.</P>

              <SUBJECT>
                <E T="7462">In vivo</E> micronucleus assay.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The micronucleus assay is an <E T="03">in vivo</E> cytogenetic test which uses erythrocytes in the bone marrow of rodents to detect chemical damage to the chromosomes or mitotic apparatus of mammalian cells. As the erythroblast develops into an erythrocyte (red blood cell), its main nucleus is extruded and may leave a micronucleus in the cell body; a few micronuclei form under normal conditions in blood elements. This assay is based on an increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes found in bone marrow from treated animals compared to that of control animals. The visualization of micronuclei is facilitated in these cells because they lack a main nucleus.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Micronuclei</E> mean small particles consisting of acentric fragments of chromosomes or entire chromosomes, which lag behind at anaphase of cell division. After telophase, these fragments may not be included in the nuclei of daughter cells and form single or multiple micronuclei in the cytoplasm.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Polychromatic erythrocyte</E> (PCE) means an immature red blood cell that, because it contains RNA, can be differentiated by appropriate staining techniques from a normochromatic erythrocyte (NCE), which lacks RNA. In one to two days, a PCE matures into a NCE.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test method</E>—(1) <E T="03">Principle of the test method.</E> (i) Groups of rodents are exposed by the inhalation route for a minimum of 6 hours/day over a period of not less than 28 days to three or more concentrations of a test substance in air. Groups of animals are sacrificed at the end of the exposure period and femoral bone marrow is extracted. The bone marrow is then smeared onto glass slides, stained, and PCEs are scored for micronuclei. Researchers may need to run a trial at the highest tolerated concentration of the test atmosphere to optimize the sample collection time for micronucleated cells.</P>
              <P>(ii) This assay may be done separately or in combination with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions in § 79.62.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Species and strain.</E> (i) The rat is the recommended test animal. Other rodent species may be used in this assay, but use of that species will be justified by the tester.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a strain of mouse is used in this assay, the tester shall sample peripheral blood from an appropriate site on the test animal, e.g., the tail vein, as a source of normochromatic erythrocytes. Results shall be reported as outlined later in this guideline with “normochromatic” interchanged for “polychromatic”, where specified.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Animal number and sex.</E> At least five female and five male animals per experimental/sample and control group shall be used. The use of a single sex or a smaller number of animals shall be justified.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Positive control group.</E> A single concentration of a compound known to produce micronuclei <E T="03">in vivo</E> is adequate as a positive control if it shows a significant response at any one time point; additional concentration levels may be used. To select an appropriate concentration level, a pilot or trial study may be advisable. Initially, one concentration of the test substance may be used, the maximum tolerated dose or that producing some indication of toxicity, e.g., a drop in the ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes. Intraperitoneal injection of 1,2-dimethyl-benz-anthracene or benzene are examples of positive control exposures. A concentration of 50-80 percent of an LD50 may be a suitable guide.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Test performance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Inhalation exposure.</E> (i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under § 79.60.<PRTPAGE P="589"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure guideline in § 79.61.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preparation of slides and sampling times.</E> Within twenty-four hours of the last exposure, test animals will be sacrificed. One femur from each test animal will be removed and placed in fetal bovine serum. The bone marrow is removed, cells processed, and two bone marrow smears are made for each animal on glass microscope slides. The slides are stained with acridine- orange (AO) or another appropriate stain (Giemsa + Wright's, etc.) and examined under a microscope.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Analysis.</E> Slides shall be coded for study before microscopic analysis. At least 1,000 first-division erythrocytes per animal shall be scored for the incidence of micronuclei. Sexes will be analyzed separately.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Data and report</E>—(1) <E T="03">Treatment of results.</E> In addition to the reporting requirements specified under §§ 79.60 and 79.61, the final test report must include the criteria for scoring micronuclei. Individual data shall be presented in a tabular form including both positive and negative controls and experimental groups. The number of polychromatic erythrocytes scored, the number of micronucleated erythrocytes, the percentage of micronucleated cells, and, where applicable, the percentage of micronucleated erythrocytes shall be listed separately for each experimental and control animal. Absolute numbers shall be included if percentages are reported.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Interpretation of data.</E> (i) There are several criteria for determining a positive response, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at least one of the test substance concentrations.</P>
              <P>(ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes or a statistically significant and reproducible positive response at any one of the test points is considered nonmutagenic in this system.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Test evaluation.</E> (i) Positive results in the micronucleus test provide information on the ability of a chemical to induce micronuclei in erythrocytes of the test species under the conditions of the test. This damage may have been the result of chromosomal damage or damage to the mitotic apparatus.</P>
              <P>(ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the test substance does not produce micronuclei in the bone marrow of the test species.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Test report.</E> In addition to the reporting recommendations as specified under § 79.60, the following specific information shall be reported:</P>
              <P>(1) Test atmosphere concentration(s) used and rationale for concentration selection.</P>
              <P>(2) Rationale for and description of treatment and sampling schedules, toxicity data, negative and positive controls.</P>

              <SUBJECT>
                <E T="7462">In vivo</E> sister chromatid exchange assay.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The <E T="03">in vivo</E> sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay detects the ability of a chemical to enhance the exchange of DNA between two sister chromatids of a duplicating chromosome. The most commonly used assays employ mammalian bone marrow cells or peripheral blood lymphocytes, often from rodent species.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">C-metaphase</E> means a state of arrested cell growth typically seen after treatment with a spindle inhibitor, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> colchicine.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Sister chromatid exchange</E> means a reciprocal interchange of the two chromatid arms within a single chromosome. This exchange is visualized during the metaphase portion of the cell cycle and presumably requires the enzymatic incision, translocation and ligation of at least two DNA helices.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test method</E>—(1) <E T="03">Principle of the test method.</E> (i) Groups of rodents are exposed by the inhalation route for a minimum of 6 hours/day over a period of not less than 28 days to three or more concentrations of a test substance in air. Groups of animals are sacrificed at the end of the exposure period and blood lymphocyte cell cultures are prepared from study animals. Cell growth is suspended after a time and cells are harvested, fixed and stained before scoring for SCEs. Researchers may need to run a trial at the highest tolerated concentration of the test atmosphere to optimize the sample collection time for second division metaphase cells.</P>
              <P>(ii) This assay may be done separately or in combination with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions in § 79.62.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Description.</E> (i) The method described here employs peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of laboratory rodents exposed to the test atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(ii) Within twenty-four hours of the last exposure, test animal lymphocytes are obtained by heart puncture and duplicate cell cultures are started for each animal. Cultures are grown in bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and then a spindle inhibitor (e.g., colchicine) is added to arrest cell growth. Cells are harvested, fixed, and stained and their chromosomes are scored for SCEs.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Species and strain.</E> The rat is the recommended test animal. Other rodent species may be used in this assay, but use of that species will be justified by the tester.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Animal number and sex.</E> At least five female and five male animals per experimental and control group shall be used. The use of a single sex or different number of animals shall be justified.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Positive control group.</E> A single concentration of a compound known to produce SCEs <E T="03">in vivo</E> is adequate as a positive control if it shows a significant response at any one time point; additional concentration levels may be used. To select an appropriate concentration level, a pilot or trial study may be advisable. Initially, one concentration of the test substance may be used, the maximum tolerated dose or that producing some indication of toxicity as evidenced by animal morbidity (including death) or target cell toxicity. Intraperitoneal injection of 1,2-dimethyl-benz-anthracene or benzene are examples of positive control exposures. A concentration of 50-80 percent of an LD50 would also be a suitable guide.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Inhalation exposure.</E> (i) All data developed within this study shall be in <PRTPAGE P="591"/>accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under § 79.60.</P>
              <P>(ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure guideline in § 79.61.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Test performance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Treatment.</E> At the conclusion of the exposure period, all test animals are anaesthetized and heart punctures are performed. Lymphocytes are isolated over a Ficoll gradient and replicate cell cultures are started for each animal. After some 21 hours, the cells are treated with BrdU and returned to incubation. The following day, a spindle inhibitor (e.g., colchicine) is added to arrest cell growth in c-metaphase. Cells are harvested 4 hours later and second-division metaphase cells are washed and fixed in methanol:acetic acid, stained, and chromosome preparations are scored for SCEs.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Staining method.</E> Staining of slides to reveal SCEs can be performed according to any of several protocols. However, the fluorescence plus Giemsa method is recommended.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Number of cells scored.</E> (i) A minimum of 25 well-stained, second-division metaphase cells shall be scored for each animal for each cell type.</P>
              <P>(ii) At least 100 consecutive metaphase cells shall be scored for the number of first, second, and third division metaphases for each animal for each cell type.</P>
              <P>(iii) At least 1000 consecutive PBL's shall be scored for the number of metaphase cells present.</P>
              <P>(iv) The number of cells to be analyzed per animal shall be based upon the number of animals used, the negative control frequency, the pre-determined sensitivity and the power chosen for the test. Slides shall be coded before microscopic analysis.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Data and report</E>—(1) <E T="03">Treatment of results.</E> In addition to the reporting requirements specified under §§ 79.60 and 61, data shall be presented in tabular form, providing scores for both the number of SCE for each metaphase. Differences among animals within each group shall be considered before making comparisons between treated and control groups.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Statistical evaluation.</E> Data shall be evaluated by appropriate statistical methods.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Interpretation of results.</E> (i) There are several criteria for determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of SCE. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at least one of the test concentrations.</P>
              <P>(ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of SCE or a statistically significant and reproducible positive response at any one of the test concentrations is considered not to induce rearrangements of DNA segments in this system.</P>
              <P>(iii) Both biological and statistical significance shall be considered together in the evaluation.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Test evaluation.</E> (i) A positive result in the <E T="03">in vivo</E> SCE assay for either, or both, the lung or lymphocyte cultures indicates that under the test conditions the test substance induces reciprocal interchanges of DNA in duplicating chromosomes from lung or lymphocyte cells of the test species.</P>
              <P>(ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the test substance does not induce reciprocal interchanges in lung or lymphocyte cells of the test species.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Test report.</E> In addition to the reporting recommendations as specified under §§ 79.60 and 79.61, the following specific information shall be reported:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Neuropathology assessment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) The histopathological and biochemical techniques in this guideline are designed to develop data in animals on morphologic changes in the nervous system associated with repeated inhalation exposures to motor vehicle emissions. These tests are not intended to provide a detailed evaluation of neurotoxicity. Neuropathological evaluation should be complemented by other neurotoxicity studies, e.g. behavioral and neurophysiological studies and/or general toxicity testing, to more completely assess the neurotoxic potential of an exposure.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Neurotoxicity (NTX) or a neurotoxic effect is an adverse change in the structure or function of the nervous system following exposure to a chemical substance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Principle of the test method.</E> (1) Laboratory rodents are exposed to one of several concentration levels of a test atmosphere for at least six hours daily over a period of 90 days. At the end of the exposure period, the animals are anaesthetized, perfused <E T="03">in situ</E> with fixative, and tissues in the nervous system are examined grossly and prepared for microscopic examination. Starting with the highest dosage level, tissues are examined under the light microscope for morphologic changes, until a no-observed-adverse-effect level is determined. In cases where light microscopy has revealed neuropathology, the NOAEL may be confirmed by electron microscopy.</P>
              <P>(2) The tests described herein may be combined with any other toxicity study, as long as none of the requirements of either are violated by the combination. Specifically, this assay may be combined with a subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to provisions in § 79.62.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limit test.</E> If a test at one dose level of the highest concentration that can be achieved while maintaining a particle size distribution with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 4 micrometers (µm) or less, using the procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section, produces no observable toxic effects and if toxicity would not be expected based upon data of structurally related compounds, then a full study using three dose levels might not be necessary. Expected human exposure though may indicate the need for a higher dose level.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Test procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Animal selection</E>—(i) <E T="03">Species and strain.</E> Testing shall be performed in the species being used in other NTX tests. A standard strain of laboratory rat is recommended. The choice of species shall take into consideration such factors as the comparative metabolism of the chemical and species sensitivity to the toxic effects of the test substance, as evidenced by the results of other studies, the potential for combined studies, and the availability of other toxicity data for the species.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Age.</E> Animals shall be at least ten weeks of age at the start of exposure.<PRTPAGE P="593"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Sex.</E> Both sexes shall be used unless it is demonstrated that one sex is refractory to the effects of exposure.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Number of Animals.</E> A minimum of ten animals per group shall be used. The tissues from each animal shall be examined separately.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Control Groups.</E> (i) A concurrent control group, exposed to clean, filtered air only, is required.</P>
              <P>(ii) The laboratory performing the testing shall provide positive control data, e.g., results from repeated acrylamide exposure, as evidence of the ability of their histology procedures to detect neurotoxic endpoints. Positive control data shall be collected at the time of the test study unless the laboratory can demonstrate the adequacy of historical data for the planned study.</P>
              <P>(iii) A satellite group of 10 female and 10 male test subjects shall be treated with the highest concentration level for the duration of the exposure and observed thereafter for reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic effects during a post-treatment period of not less than 28 days.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Inhalation exposure.</E> (i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under § 79.60.</P>
              <P>(ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure guideline in § 79.61.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Study conduct</E>—(i) <E T="03">Observation of animals.</E> All toxicological (e.g., weight loss) and neurological signs (e.g., motor disturbance) shall be recorded frequently enough to observe any abnormality, and not less than weekly.</P>
              <P>(ii) The following is a minimal list of measures that shall be noted:</P>
              <P>(A) Body weight;</P>
              <P>(B) Subject's reactivity to general stimuli such as removal from the cage or handling;</P>
              <P>(C) Description, incidence, and severity of any convulsions, tremors, or abnormal motor movements in the home cage;</P>
              <P>(D) Descriptions and incidence of posture and gait abnormalities observed in the home cage; and</P>
              <P>(E) Description and incidence of any unusual or abnormal behaviors, excessive or repetitive actions (stereotypies), emaciation, dehydration, hypotonia or hypertonia, altered fur appearance, red or crusty deposits around the eyes, nose, or mouth, and any other observations that may facilitate interpretation of the data.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Sacrifice of animals</E>—(A) <E T="03">General.</E> The goal of the techniques outlined for sacrifice of animals and preparation of tissues is preservation of tissue morphology to simulate the living state of the cell.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Perfusion technique.</E> Animals shall be perfused <E T="03">in situ</E> by a generally recognized technique. For fixation suitable for light or electronic microscopy, saline solution followed by buffered 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde or buffered 4.0 percent paraformaldehyde, is recommended. While some minor modifications or variations in procedures are used in different laboratories, a detailed and standard procedure for vascular perfusion may be found in the text by Zeman and Innes (1963), Hayat (1970), and Spencer and Schaumburg (1980) under paragraph (g) of this section. A more sophisticated technique is described by Palay and Chan-Palay (1974) under paragraph (g) of this section. In addition, the lungs shall be instilled with fixative via the trachea during the fixation process in order to preserve the lungs and achieve whole-body fixation.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Removal of brain and cord.</E> After perfusion, the bony structure (cranium and vertebral column) shall be exposed. Animals shall then be stored in fixative-filled bags at 4 °C for 8-12 hours. The cranium and vertebral column shall be removed carefully by trained technicians without physical damage of the brain and cord. Detailed dissection procedures may be found in the text by Palay and Chan-Palay (1974) under paragraph (g) of this section. After removal, simple measurement of the size (length and width) and weight of the whole brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, pons-medulla) shall be made. Any abnormal coloration or discoloration of the brain and cord shall also be noted and recorded.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Sampling.</E> Cross-sections of the following areas shall be examined: The forebrain, the center of the cerebrum, the midbrain, the cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata; the spinal cord at <PRTPAGE P="594"/>the cervical swelling (C<E T="52">3</E>-C<E T="52">6</E>), and proximal sciatic nerve (mid-thigh and sciatic notch) or tibial nerve (at knee). Other sites and tissue elements (e.g., gastrocnemius muscle) shall be examined if deemed necessary. Any observable gross changes shall be recorded.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Specimen storage.</E> Tissue samples from both the central and peripheral nervous system shall be further immersion fixed and stored in appropriate fixative (e.g., 10 percent buffered formalin for light microscopy; 2.5 percent buffered gluteraldehyde or 4.0 percent buffered paraformaldehyde for electron microscopy) for future examination. The volume of fixative versus the volume of tissues in a specimen jar shall be no less than 25:1. All stored tissues shall be washed with buffer for at least 2 hours prior to further tissue processing.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Histopathology examination</E>—(A) <E T="03">Fixation.</E> Tissue specimens stored in 10 percent buffered formalin may be used for this purpose. All tissues must be immersion fixed in fixative for at least 48 hours prior to further tissue processing.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Dehydration.</E> All tissue specimens shall be washed for at least 1 hour with water or buffer, prior to dehydration. (A longer washing time is needed if the specimens have been stored in fixative for a prolonged period of time.) Dehydration can be performed with increasing concentration of graded ethanols up to absolute alcohol.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Clearing and embedding.</E> After dehydration, tissue specimens shall be cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin or paraplast. Multiple tissue specimens (e.g. brain, cord, ganglia) may be embedded together in one single block for sectioning. All tissue blocks shall be labelled showing at least the experiment number, animal number, and specimens embedded.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Sectioning.</E> Tissue sections, 5 to 6 microns in thickness, shall be prepared from the tissue blocks and mounted on standard glass slides. It is recommended that several additional sections be made from each block at this time for possible future needs for special stainings. All tissue blocks and slides shall be filed and stored in properly labeled files or boxes.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Histopathological techniques.</E> The following general testing sequence is proposed for gathering histopathological data:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">General staining.</E> A general staining procedure shall be performed on all tissue specimens in the highest treatment group. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) shall be used for this purpose. The staining shall be differentiated properly to achieve bluish nuclei with pinkish background.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Peripheral nerve teasing.</E> Peripheral nerve fiber teasing shall be used. Detailed staining methodology is available in standard histotechnological manuals such as AFIP (1968), Ralis <E T="03">et al.</E> (1973), and Chang (1979) under paragraph (g) of this section. The nerve fiber teasing technique is discussed in Spencer and Schaumberg (1980) under paragraph (g) of this section. A section of normal tissue shall be included in each staining to assure that adequate staining has occurred. Any changes shall be noted and representative photographs shall be taken. If a lesion(s) is observed, the special techniques shall be repeated in the next lower treatment group until no further lesion is detectable.</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Examination.</E> All stained microscopic slides shall be examined with a standard research microscope. Examples of cellular alterations (e.g., neuronal vacuolation, degeneration, and necrosis) and tissue changes (e.g., gliosis, leukocytic infiltration, and cystic formation) shall be recorded and photographed.</P>
              <P>(f) Data collection, reporting, and evaluation. In addition to information meeting the requirements stated under 40 CFR 79.60 and 79.61, the following specific information shall be reported:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Description of test system and test methods.</E> (i) A description of the general design of the experiment shall be provided. This shall include a short justification explaining any decisions where professional judgment is involved such as fixation technique and choice of stains; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Positive control data from the laboratory performing the test that demonstrate the sensitivity of the procedures being used. Historical data may be used if all essential aspects of <PRTPAGE P="595"/>the experimental protocol are the same.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Results.</E> All observations shall be recorded and arranged by test groups. This data may be presented in the following recommended format:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Description of signs and lesions for each animal.</E> For each animal, data must be submitted showing its identification (animal number, treatment, dose, duration), neurologic signs, location(s) nature of, frequency, and severity of lesion(s). A commonly-used scale such as 1 + , 2 + , 3 + , and 4 + for degree of severity ranging from very slight to extensive may be used. Any diagnoses derived from neurologic signs and lesions including naturally occurring diseases or conditions, shall also be recorded;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Counts and incidence of lesions, by test group.</E> Data shall be tabulated to show:</P>
              <P>(A) The number of animals used in each group, the number of animals displaying specific neurologic signs, and the number of animals in which any lesion was found; and</P>
              <P>(B) The number of animals affected by each different type of lesion, the average grade of each type of lesion, and the frequency of each different type and/or location of lesion.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Evaluation of data.</E> (A) An evaluation of the data based on gross necropsy findings and microscopic pathology observations shall be made and supplied. The evaluation shall include the relationship, if any, between the animal's exposure to the test atmosphere and the frequency and severity of any lesions observed; and</P>
              <P>(B) The evaluation of dose-response, if existent, for various groups shall be given, and a description of statistical method must be presented. The evaluation of neuropathology data shall include, where applicable, an assessment in conjunction with any other neurotoxicity studies, electrophysiological, behavioral, or neurochemical, which may be relevant to this study.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Glial fibrillary acidic protein assay.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Chemical-induced injury of the nervous system, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the brain, is associated with astrocytic hypertrophy at the site of damage (see O'Callaghan, 1988 in paragraph (e)(3) in this section). Assays of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the major intermediate filament protein of astrocytes, can be used to document this response. To date, a diverse variety of chemical insults known to be injurious to the central nervous system have been shown to increase GFAP. Moreover, increases in GFAP can be seen at concentrations below those necessary to produce cytopathology as determined by routine Nissl stains (standard neuropathology). Thus it appears that assays of GFAP represent a sensitive <PRTPAGE P="596"/>approach for documenting the existence and location of chemical-induced injury of the central nervous system. Additional functional, histopathological, and biochemical tests are necessary to assess completely the neurotoxic potential of any chemical. This biochemical test is intended to be used in conjunction with neurohistopathological studies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Principle of the test method.</E> (1) This guideline describes the conduct of a radioimmunoassay for measurement of the amount of GFAP in the brain of vehicle emission-exposed and unexposed control animals. It is based on modifications (O'Callaghan &amp; Miller 1985 in paragraph (e)(5), O'Callaghan 1987 in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the dot-immunobinding procedure described by Jahn <E T="03">et al.</E> (1984) in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Briefly, brain tissue samples from study animals are assayed for total protein, diluted in dot-immunobinding buffer, and applied to nitrocellulose sheets. The spotted sheets are then fixed, blocked, washed and incubated in anti-GFAP antibody and [I<SU>125</SU>] Protein A. Bound protein A is then quantified by gamma spectrometry. In lieu of purified protein standards, standard curves are constructed from dilution of a single control sample. By comparing the immunoreactivity of individual samples (both control and exposed groups) with that of the sample used to generate the standard curve, the relative immunoreactivity of each sample is obtained. The immunoreactivity of the control groups is normalized to 100 percent and all data are expressed as a percentage of control. A variation on this radioimmunoassay procedure has been proposed (O'Callaghan 1991 in paragraph (e)(4) of this section) which uses a “sandwich” of GFAP, anti-GFAP, and a chromophore in a microtiter plate format enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The use of this variation shall be justified.</P>
              <P>(2) This assay may be done separately or in combination with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions of § 79.62.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Test procedure</E>—(1) <E T="03">Animal selection</E>—(i) <E T="03">Species and strain.</E> Test shall be performed on the species being used in concurrent testing for neurotoxic or other health effect endpoints. This will generally be a species of laboratory rat. The use of other rodent or non-rodent species shall be justified.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Age.</E> Based on other concurrent testing, young adult rats shall be used. Study rodents shall not be older than ten weeks at the start of exposures.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Number of animals.</E> A minimum of ten animals per group shall be used. The tissues from each animal shall be examined separately.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Sex.</E> Both sexes shall be used unless it is demonstrated that one sex is refractory to the effects.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Materials.</E> The materials necessary to perform this study are [I<SU>125</SU>] Protein A (2-10 µCi/µg), Anti-sera to GFAP, nitrocellulose paper (0.1 or 0.2 µm pore size), sample application template (optional; e.g., “Minifold II”, Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Keene, NH), plastic sheet incubation trays.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Study conduct.</E> (i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under § 79.60.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tissue Preparation.</E> Animals are euthanized 24 hours after the last exposure and the brain is excised from the skull. On a cold dissecting platform, the following six regions are dissected freehand: cerebellum; cerebral cortex; hippocampus; striatum; thalamus/hypothalamus; and the rest of the brain. Each region is then weighed and homogenized in 10 volumes of hot (70-90 °C) 1 percent (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Homogenization is best achieved through sonic disruption. A motor driven pestle inserted into a tissue grinding vessel is a suitable alternative. The homogenized samples can then be stored frozen at −70 °C for at least 4 years without loss of GFAP content.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Total Protein Assay.</E> Aliquots of the tissue samples are assayed for total protein using the method of Smith <E T="03">et al.</E> (1985) in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. This assay may be purchased in kit form (e.g., Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Sample Preparation.</E> Dilute tissue samples in sample buffer (120 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<E T="52">2</E>), 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.7 percent Triton X-100) to a final concentration of 0.25 mg total protein per ml (5 µg/20 µl).<PRTPAGE P="597"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Preparation of Standard Curve.</E> Dilute a single control sample in sample buffer to give at least five standards, between 1 and 10 µg total protein per 20 µl. The suggested values of total protein per 20 µl sample buffer are 1.25, 2.50, 3.25, 5.0, 6.25, 7.5, 8.75, and 10.0 µg.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Preparation of Nitrocellulose Sheets.</E> Nitrocellulose sheets of 0.1 or 0.2 micron pore size are rinsed by immersion in distilled water for 5 minutes and then air dried.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Sample Application.</E> Samples can be spotted onto the nitrocellulose sheets free-hand or with the aid of a template. For free-hand application, draw a grid of squares approximately 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters (cm) on the nitrocellulose sheets using a soft pencil. Spot 5-10 µl portions to the center of each square for a total sample volume of 20 µl. For template aided sample application a washerless microliter capacity sample application manifold is used. Position the nitrocellulose sheet in the sample application device as recommended by the manufacturer and spot a 20 µl sample in one application. Do not wet the nitrocellulose or any support elements prior to sample application. Do not apply vacuum during or after sample application. After spotting samples (using either method), let the sheets air dry. The sheets can be stored at room temperature for several days after sample application.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Standard Incubation Conditions.</E> These conditions have been described by Jahn <E T="03">et al.</E> (1984) in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. All steps are carried out at room temperature on a flat shaking platform (one complete excursion every 2-3 seconds). For best results, do not use rocking or orbital shakers. Perform the following steps in enough solution to cover the nitrocellulose sheets to a depth of 1 cm.</P>
              <P>(A) Incubate 20 minutes in fixer (25 percent (v/v) isopropanol, 10 percent (v/v) acetic acid).</P>
              <P>(B) Discard fixer, wash several times in deionized water to eliminate the fixer, and then incubate for 5 minutes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS): 200 mM NaCL, 60 mM Tris-HCl to pH 7.4.</P>
              <P>(C) Discard TBS and incubate 1 hour in blocking solution (0.5 percent gelatin (w/v)) in TBS.</P>
              <P>(D) Discard blocking solution and incubate for 2 hours in antibody solution (anti-GFAP antiserum diluted to the desired dilution in blocking solution containing 0.1 percent Triton X-100). Serum anti-bovine GFAP, which cross reacts with GFAP from rodents and humans, can be obtained commercially (e.g., Dako Corp.) and used at a dilution of 1:500.</P>
              <P>(E) Discard antibody solution, and wash in 4 changes of TBS for 5 minutes each time. Then wash in TBS for 10 minutes.</P>
              <P>(F) Discard TBS and incubate in blocking solution for 30 minutes.</P>
              <P>(G) Discard blocking solution and incubate for 1 hour in Protein A solution ([I<SU>125</SU>]-labeled Protein A diluted in blocking solution containing 0.1 percent Triton X-100, sufficient to produce 2000 counts per minute (cpm) per 10 µl of Protein A solution).</P>
              <P>(H) Remove Protein A solution (it may be reused once). Wash in 0.1 percent Triton X-100 in TBS (TBSTX) for 5 minutes, 4 times. Then wash in TBSTX for 2-3 hours for 4 additional times. An overnight wash in a larger volume can be used to replace the last 4 washes.</P>
              <P>(I) Hang sheets to air-dry. Cut out squares or spots and count radioactivity in a gamma counter.</P>
              <P>(ix) <E T="03">Expression of data.</E> Compare radioactivity counts for samples obtained from control and treated animals with counts obtained from the standard curve. By comparing the immunoreactivity (counts) of each sample with that of the standard curve, the relative amount of GFAP in each sample can be determined and expressed as a percent of control.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Data Reporting and Evaluation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Test Report.</E> In addition to information meeting the requirements stated under 40 CFR 79.60, the following specific information shall be reported:</P>
              <P>(i) Body weight and brain region weights at time of sacrifice for each subject tested;</P>
              <P>(ii) Indication of whether each subject survived to sacrifice or time of death;</P>
              <P>(iii) Data from control animals and blank samples; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Statistical evaluation of results;<PRTPAGE P="598"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Evaluation of Results.</E> (i) Results shall be evaluated in terms of the extent of change in the amount of GFAP as a function of treatment and dose. GFAP assays (of any brain region) from a minimum of 6 samples typically will result in a standard error of the mean of ±5 percent. In this case, a chemically-induced increase in GFAP of 115 percent of control is likely to be statistically significant.</P>
              <P>(ii) The results of this assay shall be compared to and evaluated with any relevant behavioral and histopathological data.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">References.</E> For additional background information on this test guideline the following references should be consulted.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Base pair mutagen</E> means an agent which causes a base change in DNA. In a reversion assay, this change may occur at the site of the original mutation or at a second site in the chromosome.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reference substances.</E> These may include, but need not be limited to, sodium azide, 2-nitrofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, 2-aminoanthracene, congo red, benzopurpurin 4B, trypan blue or direct blue 1.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Test method</E>—(1) <E T="03">Principle.</E> Motor vehicle combustion emissions from fuel or additive/base fuel mixtures are, first, filtered to trap particulate matter and, then, passed through a sorbent resin to trap semi-volatile gases. Bacteria are separately exposed to the extract from both the filtered particulates and the resin-trapped organics. Assays are conducted using both test mixtures with and without a metabolic activation system and exposed cells are plated onto minimal medium. After a suitable period of incubation, revertant colonies are counted in test cultures and compared to the number of spontaneous revertants in unexposed control cultures.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Description.</E> Several methods for performing the test have been described. The procedures described here are for the direct plate incorporation <PRTPAGE P="599"/>method and the azo-reduction method. Among those used are:</P>
              <P>(i) Direct plate incorporation method;</P>
              <P>(ii) Preincubation method;</P>
              <P>(iii) Azo-reduction method;</P>
              <P>(iv) Microsuspension method; and</P>
              <P>(v) Spiral assay.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Strain selection</E>—(i) <E T="03">Designation.</E> Five tester strains shall be used in the assay. At the present time, TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 are designated as tester strains. The fifth strain will be chosen from the pool of Salmonella strains commonly used to determine the degree to which nitrated organic compounds, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> nitroarenes, contribute to the overall mutagenic activity of a test substance. TA98/1,8-DNP<E T="52">6</E> or other suitable Rosenkranz nitro-reductase resistant strains will be considered acceptable. The choice of the particular strain is left to the discretion of the researcher. However, the researcher shall justify the use of the selected bacterial tester strains.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Preparation and storage of bacterial tester strains.</E> Recognized methods of stock culture preparation and storage shall be used. The requirement of histidine for growth shall be demonstrated for each strain. Other phenotypic characteristics shall be checked using such methods as crystal violet sensitivity and resistance to ampicillin. Spontaneous reversion frequency shall be in the range expected as reported in the literature and as established in the laboratory by historical control values.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Bacterial growth.</E> Fresh cultures of bacteria shall be grown up to the late exponential or early stationary phase of growth (approximately 108-109 cells per ml).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Exogenous metabolic activation.</E> Bacteria shall be exposed to the test substance both in the presence and absence of an appropriate exogenous metabolic activation system. For the direct plate incorporation method, the most commonly used system is a cofactor-supplemented postmitochondrial fraction prepared from the livers of rodents treated with enzyme-inducing agents, such as Aroclor 1254. For the azo-reduction method, a cofactor- supplemented postmitochondrial fraction (S-9) prepared from the livers of untreated hamsters is preferred. For this method, the cofactor supplement shall contain flavin mononucleotide, exogenous glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADH and excess of glucose-6-phosphate.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Control groups</E>—(i) <E T="03">Concurrent controls.</E> Concurrent positive and negative (untreated) controls shall be included in each experiment. Positive controls shall ensure both strain responsiveness and efficacy of the metabolic activation system.</P>
              <P>(ii) Strain specific positive controls shall be included in the assay. Examples of strain specific positive controls are as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Strain TA1535, TA100: sodium azide;</P>
              <P>(B) TA98: 2-nitrofluorene (without activation), 2-anthramine (with activation);</P>
              <P>(C) TA1537: 9-aminoacridine; and</P>
              <P>(D) TA98/1,8-DNP<E T="52">6</E>: benzo(a)pyrene (with activation).</P>
              <P>The papers by Claxton <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1991 and 1992 in paragraph (g) in this section will provide helpful information for the selection of positive controls.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Positive controls to ensure the efficacy of the activation system.</E> The positive control reference substances for tests including a metabolic activation system shall be selected on the basis of the type of activation system used in the test. 2-Aminoanthracene is an example of a positive control compound in plate-incorporation tests using postmitochondrial fractions from the livers of rodents treated with enzyme-inducing agents such as Aroclor-1254. Congo red is an example of a positive control compound in the azo-reduction method. Other positive control reference substances may be used.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Class-specific positive controls.</E> The azo-reduction method shall include positive controls from the same class of compounds as the test agent wherever possible.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Sampling the test atmosphere.</E> (i) Extracts of test emissions are collected on Teflon ®-coated glass fiber filters using an exhaust dilution setup. The particulates are extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) using Soxhlet extraction techniques. Extracts in DCM can be stored at dry ice temperatures until use.<PRTPAGE P="600"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Gaseous hydrocarbons passing through the filter are trapped by a porous, polymer resin, like XAD-2/styrene-divinylbenzene, or an equivalent product. Methylene chloride is used to extract the resin and the sample is evaporated to dryness before storage or use.</P>
              <P>(iii) Samples taken from this material are then used to expose the cells in this assay. Final concentration of extracts in solvent/vehicle, or after solvent exchange, shall not interfere with cell viability or growth rate. The paper by Stump (1982) in paragraph (g) of this section is useful for preparing extracts of particulate and semi-volatile organic compounds from diesel and gasoline exhaust stream.</P>
              <P>(iv) Exposure concentrations. (A) The test should initially be performed over a broad range of concentrations. Among the criteria to be taken into consideration for determining the upper limits of test substance concentration are cytotoxicity and solubility. Cytotoxicity of the test chemical may be altered in the presence of metabolic activation systems. Toxicity may be evidenced by a reduction in the number of spontaneous revertants, a clearing of the background lawn or by the degree of survival of treated cultures. Relatively insoluble samples shall be tested up to the limits of solubility. The upper test chemical concentration shall be determined on a case by case basis.</P>
              <P>(B) Generally, a maximum of 5 mg/plate for pure substances is considered acceptable. At least 5 different concentrations of test substance shall be used with adequate intervals between test points.</P>
              <P>(C) When appropriate, a single positive response shall be confirmed by testing over a narrow range of concentrations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Test performance.</E> All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under § 79.60.</P>
              <P>(1) Direct plate incorporation method. When testing with metabolic activation, test solution, bacteria, and 0.5 ml of activation mixture containing an adequate amount of postmitochondrial fraction shall be added to the liquid overlay agar and mixed. This mixture is poured over the surface of a selective agar plate. Overlay agar shall be allowed to solidify before incubation. At the end of the incubation period, revertant colonies per plate shall be counted. When testing without metabolic activation, the test sample and 0.1 ml of a fresh bacterial culture shall be added to 2.0 ml of overlay agar.</P>
              <P>(2) Azo-reduction method. When testing with metabolic activation, 0.5 ml of activation mixture containing 150 µl of postmitochondrial fraction and 0.1 ml of bacterial culture shall be added to a test tube kept on ice. 0.1 ml of test solution shall be added, and the tubes shall be incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 30 minutes. At the end of the incubation period, 2.0 ml of agar shall be added to each tube, the contents mixed and poured over the surface of a selective agar plate. Overlay agar shall be allowed to solidify before incubation. At the end of the incubation period, revertant colonies per plate shall be counted. For tests without metabolic activation, 0.5 ml of buffer shall be used in place of the 0.5 ml of activation mixture. All other procedures shall be the same as those used for the test with metabolic activation.</P>
              <P>(3) Other methods/modifications may also be appropriate.</P>
              <P>(4) Media. An appropriate selective medium with an adequate overlay agar shall be used.</P>
              <P>(5) Incubation conditions. All plates within a given experiment shall be incubated for the same time period. This incubation period shall be for 48-72 hours at 37 °C.</P>
              <P>(6) Number of cultures. All plating shall be done at least in triplicate.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Data and report</E>—(1) <E T="03">Treatment of results.</E> Data shall be presented as number of revertant colonies per plate, revertants per kilogram (or liter) of fuel, and as revertants per kilometer (or mile, or brake-horsepower/hour, as appropriate) for each replicate and dose. These same measures shall be recorded on both the negative and positive control plates. The mean number of revertant colonies per plate, revertants per kilogram (or liter) of fuel, and revertants per kilometer (or mile, or brake-horsepower/hour), as well as individual plate counts and standard deviations shall be presented <PRTPAGE P="601"/>for the test substance, positive control, and negative control plates.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Statistical evaluation.</E> Data shall be evaluated by appropriate statistical methods. Those methods shall include, at a minimum, means and standard deviations of the reversion data.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Interpretation of results.</E> (i) There are several criteria for determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of revertants. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at least one of the test substance concentrations.</P>
