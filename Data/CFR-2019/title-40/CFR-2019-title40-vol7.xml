      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(e)(1) Notwithstanding the frequency of reporting requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator who is required by an applicable subpart to submit excess emissions and monitoring systems performance reports (and summary reports) on a quarterly (or more frequent) basis may reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard to semiannual if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting periods) the affected facility's excess emissions and monitoring systems reports submitted to comply with a standard under this part continually demonstrate that the facility is in compliance with the applicable standard;</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator continues to comply with all recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and the applicable standard; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The Administrator does not object to a reduced frequency of reporting for the affected facility, as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and monitoring systems performance (and summary) reports may be reduced only after the owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the source's entire previous performance history during the required recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, including performance test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's conformance with operation and <PRTPAGE P="56"/>maintenance requirements. Such information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, approval is automatically granted.</P>
              <P>(3) As soon as monitoring data indicate that the affected facility is not in compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter specified in the applicable standard, the frequency of reporting shall revert to the frequency specified in the applicable standard, and the owner or operator shall submit an excess emissions and monitoring systems performance report (and summary report, if required) at the next appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event. After demonstrating compliance with the applicable standard for another full year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard as provided for in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall maintain a file of all measurements, including continuous monitoring system, monitoring device, and performance testing measurements; all continuous monitoring system performance evaluations; all continuous monitoring system or monitoring device calibration checks; adjustments and maintenance performed on these systems or devices; and all other information required by this part recorded in a permanent form suitable for inspection. The file shall be retained for at least two years following the date of such measurements, maintenance, reports, and records, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) where the CEMS installed is automated, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CEMS records and reduces the measured data to the form of the pollutant emission standard through the use of a computerized data acquisition system. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain the most recent consecutive three averaging periods of subhourly measurements and a file that contains a hard copy of the data acquisition system algorithm used to reduce the measured data into the reportable form of the standard.</P>
              <P>(2) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to install a CEMS where the measured data is manually reduced to obtain the reportable form of the standard, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain all subhourly measurements for the most recent reporting period. The subhourly measurements shall be retained for 120 days from the date of the most recent summary or excess emission report submitted to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator or delegated authority, upon notification to the source, may require the owner or operator to maintain all measurements as required by paragraph (f) of this section, if the Administrator or the delegated authority determines these records are required to more accurately assess the compliance status of the affected source.</P>
              <P>(g) If notification substantially similar to that in paragraph (a) of this section is required by any other State or local agency, sending the Administrator a copy of that notification will satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(h) Individual subparts of this part may include specific provisions which <PRTPAGE P="57"/>clarify or make inapplicable the provisions set forth in this section.</P>

              <P>(1) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.</P>
              <P>(3) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(4) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Performance tests shall be conducted and data reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in each applicable subpart unless the Administrator (1) specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a reference method with minor changes in methodology, (2) approves the use of an equivalent method, (3) approves the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in compliance, (4) waives the requirement for performance tests because the owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected facility is in compliance with the standard, or (5) approves shorter sampling times and smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Act.</P>

              <P>(c) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to the plant operator based on representative performance of the affected facility. The owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test nor shall emissions in excess of the level of the applicable emission limit during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction be considered a violation of the applicable emission limit unless otherwise specified in the applicable standard.<PRTPAGE P="58"/>

              <P>(d) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) by mutual agreement.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such facility. This includes (i) constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures and (ii) providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) Safe sampling platform(s).</P>
              <P>(3) Safe access to sampling platform(s).</P>
              <P>(4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.</P>
              <P>(f) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, each performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method.</P>
              <P>(1) Each run shall be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. For the purpose of determining compliance with an applicable standard, the arithmetic means of results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.</P>
              <P>(2) Contents of report (electronic or paper submitted copy). Unless otherwise specified in a relevant standard or test method, or as otherwise approved by the Administrator in writing, the report for a performance test shall include the elements identified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) General identification information for the facility including a mailing address, the physical address, the owner or operator or responsible official (where applicable) and his/her email address, and the appropriate Federal Registry System (FRS) number for the facility.</P>
              <P>(ii) Purpose of the test including the applicable regulation(s) requiring the test, the pollutant(s) and other parameters being measured, the applicable emission standard and any process parameter component, and a brief process description.</P>
              <P>(iii) Description of the emission unit tested including fuel burned, control devices, and vent characteristics; the appropriate source classification code (SCC); the permitted maximum process rate (where applicable); and the sampling location.</P>
              <P>(iv) Description of sampling and analysis procedures used and any modifications to standard procedures, quality assurance procedures and results, record of process operating conditions that demonstrate the applicable test conditions are met, and values for any operating parameters for which limits were being set during the test.</P>
              <P>(v) Where a test method requires you record or report, the following shall be included: Record of preparation of standards, record of calibrations, raw data sheets for field sampling, raw data sheets for field and laboratory analyses, chain-of-custody documentation, and example calculations for reported results.</P>

              <P>(vi) Identification of the company conducting the performance test including the primary office address, telephone number, and the contact for <PRTPAGE P="59"/>this test program including his/her email address.</P>
              <P>(g) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.</P>

              <P>(1) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60, Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix A-4 of part 60, Methods 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60, Methods 20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60, Methods 30A and 30B of appendix A-8 of part 60, and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, <E T="03">www.epa.gov/ttn/emc,</E> to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the <PRTPAGE P="60"/>compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request and the compliance authority may grant a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>(i) Preparing the sample;</P>
              <P>(ii) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;</P>
              <P>(iii) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range.</P>
              <P>(iv) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;</P>
              <P>(v) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;</P>
              <P>(vi) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;</P>
              <P>(vii) The AASP shall report the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and then to the source owner, operator, or representative. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.</P>

              <P>(viii) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in cooperation with <PRTPAGE P="61"/>the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed;</P>
              <P>(ix) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.</P>
              <P>(3) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:</P>
              <P>(i) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP;</P>
              <P>(ii) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years;</P>
              <P>(iii) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.</P>

              <P>(4) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-119. A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at <E T="03">http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm.</E> The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (g)(2) through (4)of this section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL, <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(h) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, each test location must be verified to be free of cyclonic flow and evaluated for the existence of emission gas stratification and the required number of sampling traverse points. If other procedures are not specified in the applicable subpart to the regulations, use the appropriate procedures in Method 1 to check for cyclonic flow and Method 7E to evaluate emission gas stratification and selection of sampling points.</P>
              <P>(i) Whenever the use of multiple calibration gases is required by a test method, performance specification, or quality assurance procedure in a part 60 standard or appendix, Method 205 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M of this chapter, “Verification of Gas Dilution Systems for Field Instrument Calibrations,” may be used.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Compliance with standards in this part, other than opacity standards, shall be determined in accordance with performance tests established by § 60.8, unless otherwise specified in the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(b) Compliance with opacity standards in this part shall be determined by conducting observations in accordance with Method 9 in appendix A of this part, any alternative method that is approved by the Administrator, or as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. For purposes of determining initial compliance, the minimum total time of observations shall be 3 hours (30 6-minute averages) for the performance test or other set of observations (meaning those fugitive-type emission sources subject only to an opacity standard).</P>
              <P>(c) The opacity standards set forth in this part shall apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and as otherwise provided in the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(d) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, owners and operators shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate any affected facility including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, opacity observations, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the source.</P>

              <P>(e)(1) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, opacity observations shall be conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required in § 60.8 unless one of the following conditions apply. If no performance test under § 60.8 is required, then opacity observations shall be conducted within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated but no later than 180 days after initial startup of the facility. If visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial performance test required under § 60.8, the source owner or operator shall reschedule the opacity observations as soon after the initial performance test as possible, but not later than 30 days thereafter, and shall advise the Administrator of the rescheduled date. In these cases, the 30-day prior notification to the Administrator required in § 60.7(a)(6) shall be waived. The rescheduled opacity observations shall be conducted (to the extent possible) under the same operating conditions that existed during the initial performance test conducted under § 60.8. The visible emissions observer shall determine whether visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity observations from being made concurrently with the initial performance test in accordance with procedures contained in Method 9 of appendix B of this part. Opacity readings of portions of plumes which contain condensed, uncombined water vapor shall not be used for purposes of determing compliance with opacity standards. The owner or operator of an affected facility shall make available, upon request by the Administrator, such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions under which the visual observations were made and shall provide evidence indicating proof of current visible observer emission certification. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the results of continuous monitoring by transmissometer which indicate that the opacity at the time visual observations were made was not in excess of the standard are probative but not conclusive evidence of the actual opacity of an emission, provided that the source shall meet the burden of proving that the instrument used meets (at the <PRTPAGE P="63"/>time of the alleged violation) Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of this part, has been properly maintained and (at the time of the alleged violation) that the resulting data have not been altered in any way.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility to which an opacity standard in this part applies shall conduct opacity observations in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall record the opacity of emissions, and shall report to the Administrator the opacity results along with the results of the initial performance test required under § 60.8. The inability of an owner or operator to secure a visible emissions observer shall not be considered a reason for not conducting the opacity observations concurrent with the initial performance test.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator of an affected facility to which an opacity standard in this part applies may request the Administrator to determine and to record the opacity of emissions from the affected facility during the initial performance test and at such times as may be required. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall report the opacity results. Any request to the Administrator to determine and to record the opacity of emissions from an affected facility shall be included in the notification required in § 60.7(a)(6). If, for some reason, the Administrator cannot determine and record the opacity of emissions from the affected facility during the performance test, then the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(4) An owner or operator of an affected facility using a continuous opacity monitor (transmissometer) shall record the monitoring data produced during the initial performance test required by § 60.8 and shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the monitoring results along with Method 9 and § 60.8 performance test results.</P>
              <P>(5) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard may submit, for compliance purposes, continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) data results produced during any performance test required under § 60.8 in lieu of Method 9 observation data. If an owner or operator elects to submit COMS data for compliance with the opacity standard, he shall notify the Administrator of that decision, in writing, at least 30 days before any performance test required under § 60.8 is conducted. Once the owner or operator of an affected facility has notified the Administrator to that effect, the COMS data results will be used to determine opacity compliance during subsequent tests required under § 60.8 until the owner or operator notifies the Administrator, in writing, to the contrary. For the purpose of determining compliance with the opacity standard during a performance test required under § 60.8 using COMS data, the minimum total time of COMS data collection shall be averages of all 6-minute continuous periods within the duration of the mass emission performance test. Results of the COMS opacity determinations shall be submitted along with the results of the performance test required under § 60.8. The owner or operator of an affected facility using a COMS for compliance purposes is responsible for demonstrating that the COMS meets the requirements specified in § 60.13(c) of this part, that the COMS has been properly maintained and operated, and that the resulting data have not been altered in any way. If COMS data results are submitted for compliance with the opacity standard for a period of time during which Method 9 data indicates noncompliance, the Method 9 data will be used to determine compliance with the opacity standard.</P>

              <P>(6) Upon receipt from an owner or operator of the written reports of the results of the performance tests required by § 60.8, the opacity observation results and observer certification required by § 60.11(e)(1), and the COMS results, if applicable, the Administrator will make a finding concerning compliance with opacity and other applicable standards. If COMS data results are used to comply with an opacity standard, only those results are required to be submitted along with the performance test results required by § 60.8. If the Administrator finds that an affected facility is in compliance with all <PRTPAGE P="64"/>applicable standards for which performance tests are conducted in accordance with § 60.8 of this part but during the time such performance tests are being conducted fails to meet any applicable opacity standard, he shall notify the owner or operator and advise him that he may petition the Administrator within 10 days of receipt of notification to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity standard for the affected facility.</P>
              <P>(7) The Administrator will grant such a petition upon a demonstration by the owner or operator that the affected facility and associated air pollution control equipment was operated and maintained in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance tests; that the performance tests were performed under the conditions established by the Administrator; and that the affected facility and associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being adjusted or operated to meet the applicable opacity standard.</P>

              <P>(8) The Administrator will establish an opacity standard for the affected facility meeting the above requirements at a level at which the source will be able, as indicated by the performance and opacity tests, to meet the opacity standard at all times during which the source is meeting the mass or concentration emission standard. The Administrator will promulgate the new opacity standard in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(d)(1) Owners and operators of a CEMS installed in accordance with the provisions of this part, must check the zero (or low level value between 0 and 20 percent of span value) and span (50 to 100 percent of span value) calibration drifts at least once each operating day in accordance with a written procedure. The zero and span must, at a minimum, be adjusted whenever either the 24-hour zero drift or the 24-hour span drift exceeds two times the limit of the applicable performance specification in appendix B of this part. The system must allow the amount of the excess zero and span drift to be recorded and quantified whenever specified. Owners and operators of a COMS installed in accordance with the provisions of this part must check the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least once daily. For a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and upscale calibration materials is defined in the applicable version of PS-1 in appendix B of this part. For a COMS, the optical surfaces, exposed to the effluent gases, must be cleaned before performing the zero and upscale drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic zero adjustments. The optical surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation exceeds 4 percent opacity.</P>
              <P>(2) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the following procedures must be followed for a COMS. Minimum procedures must include an automated method for producing a simulated zero opacity condition and an upscale opacity condition using a certified neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known obstruction of the light beam. Such procedures must provide a system check of all active analyzer internal optics with power or curvature, all active electronic circuitry including the light source and photodetector assembly, and electronic or electro-mechanical systems and hardware and or software used during normal measurement operation.</P>
              <P>(e) Except for system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments required under paragraph (d) of this section, all continuous monitoring systems shall be in continuous operation and shall meet minimum frequency of operation requirements as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) All continuous monitoring systems referenced by paragraph (c) of this section for measuring opacity of emissions shall complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.</P>

              <P>(2) All continuous monitoring systems referenced by paragraph (c) of this section for measuring emissions, except opacity, shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period.<PRTPAGE P="66"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) All continuous monitoring systems or monitoring devices shall be installed such that representative measurements of emissions or process parameters from the affected facility are obtained. Additional procedures for location of continuous monitoring systems contained in the applicable Performance Specifications of appendix B of this part shall be used.</P>
              <P>(g) When the effluents from a single affected facility or two or more affected facilities subject to the same emission standards are combined before being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator may install applicable continuous monitoring systems on each effluent or on the combined effluent. When the affected facilities are not subject to the same emission standards, separate continuous monitoring systems shall be installed on each effluent. When the effluent from one affected facility is released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the owner or operator shall install an applicable continuous monitoring system on each separate effluent unless the installation of fewer systems is approved by the Administrator. When more than one continuous monitoring system is used to measure the emissions from one affected facility (e.g., multiple breechings, multiple outlets), the owner or operator shall report the results as required from each continuous monitoring system.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Owners or operators of all continuous monitoring systems for measurement of opacity shall reduce all data to 6-minute averages and for continuous monitoring systems other than opacity to 1-hour averages for time periods as defined in § 60.2. Six-minute opacity averages shall be calculated from 36 or more data points equally spaced over each 6-minute period.</P>
              <P>(2) For continuous monitoring systems other than opacity, 1-hour averages shall be computed as follows, except that the provisions pertaining to the validation of partial operating hours are only applicable for affected facilities that are required by the applicable subpart to include partial hours in the emission calculations:</P>

              <P>(i) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, for a full operating hour (any clock hour with 60 minutes of unit operation), at least four valid data points are required to calculate the hourly average, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, one data point in each of the 15-minute quadrants of the hour.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, for a partial operating hour (any clock hour with less than 60 minutes of unit operation), at least one valid data point in each 15-minute quadrant of the hour in which the unit operates is required to calculate the hourly average.</P>
              <P>(iii) For any operating hour in which required maintenance or quality-assurance activities are performed:</P>
              <P>(A) If the unit operates in two or more quadrants of the hour, a minimum of two valid data points, separated by at least 15 minutes, is required to calculate the hourly average; or</P>
              <P>(B) If the unit operates in only one quadrant of the hour, at least one valid data point is required to calculate the hourly average.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a daily calibration error check is failed during any operating hour, all data for that hour shall be invalidated, unless a subsequent calibration error test is passed in the same hour and the requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section are met, based solely on valid data recorded after the successful calibration.</P>
              <P>(v) For each full or partial operating hour, all valid data points shall be used to calculate the hourly average.</P>
              <P>(vi) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(vii) of this section, data recorded during periods of continuous monitoring system breakdown, repair, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments shall not be included in the data averages computed under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(vii) Owners and operators complying with the requirements of § 60.7(f)(1) or (2) must include any data recorded during periods of monitor breakdown or malfunction in the data averages.</P>
              <P>(viii) When specified in an applicable subpart, hourly averages for certain partial operating hours shall not be computed or included in the emission averages (e.g., hours with &lt; 30 minutes of unit operation under § 60.47b(d)).</P>

              <P>(ix) Either arithmetic or integrated averaging of all data may be used to <PRTPAGE P="67"/>calculate the hourly averages. The data may be recorded in reduced or nonreduced form (e.g., ppm pollutant and percent O<E T="52">2</E> or ng/J of pollutant).</P>
              <P>(3) All excess emissions shall be converted into units of the standard using the applicable conversion procedures specified in the applicable subpart. After conversion into units of the standard, the data may be rounded to the same number of significant digits used in the applicable subpart to specify the emission limit.</P>
              <P>(i) After receipt and consideration of written application, the Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring procedures or requirements of this part including, but not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a continuous monitoring system or monitoring device specified by this part would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other interferences caused by substances in the effluent gases.</P>
              <P>(2) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected facility is infrequently operated.</P>
              <P>(3) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate continuous monitoring systems that require additional measurements to correct for stack moisture conditions.</P>
              <P>(4) Alternative locations for installing continuous monitoring systems or monitoring devices when the owner or operator can demonstrate that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and representative measurements.</P>
              <P>(5) Alternative methods of converting pollutant concentration measurements to units of the standards.</P>
              <P>(6) Alternative procedures for performing daily checks of zero and span drift that do not involve use of span gases or test cells.</P>
              <P>(7) Alternatives to the A.S.T.M. test methods or sampling procedures specified by any subpart.</P>
              <P>(8) Alternative continuous monitoring systems that do not meet the design or performance requirements in Performance Specification 1, appendix B, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent relationship between its measurements and the measurements of opacity by a system complying with the requirements in Performance Specification 1. The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for each affected facility.</P>
              <P>(9) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a single affected facility or the combined effluent from two or more affected facilities is released to the atmosphere through more than one point.</P>
              <P>(j) An alternative to the relative accuracy (RA) test specified in Performance Specification 2 of appendix B may be requested as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) An alternative to the reference method tests for determining RA is available for sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less than 50 percent of the applicable standard. A source owner or operator may petition the Administrator to waive the RA test in Section 8.4 of Performance Specification 2 and substitute the procedures in Section 16.0 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the requirements in § 60.8 of this subpart or other tests performed following the criteria in § 60.8 demonstrate that the emission rate of the pollutant of interest in the units of the applicable standard is less than 50 percent of the applicable standard. For sources subject to standards expressed as control efficiency levels, a source owner or operator may petition the Administrator to waive the RA test and substitute the procedures in Section 16.0 of Performance Specification 2 if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The alternative procedures do not apply if the continuous emission monitoring system is used to determine compliance continuously with the applicable standard. The petition to waive the RA test shall include a detailed description of the procedures to be applied. Included shall be location and procedure for conducting the alternative, the concentration or response levels of the alternative RA materials, and the other equipment checks included in the alternative procedure. The Administrator will review the petition for completeness and applicability. The determination to grant a waiver will depend <PRTPAGE P="68"/>on the intended use of the CEMS data (e.g., data collection purposes other than NSPS) and may require specifications more stringent than in Performance Specification 2 (e.g., the applicable emission limit is more stringent than NSPS).</P>
              <P>(2) The waiver of a CEMS RA test will be reviewed and may be rescinded at such time, following successful completion of the alternative RA procedure, that the CEMS data indicate that the source emissions are approaching the level. The criterion for reviewing the waiver is the collection of CEMS data showing that emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the applicable standard for seven, consecutive, averaging periods as specified by the applicable regulation(s). For sources subject to standards expressed as control efficiency levels, the criterion for reviewing the waiver is the collection of CEMS data showing that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement for seven, consecutive, averaging periods as specified by the applicable regulation(s) [e.g., §§ 60.45(g) (2) and (3), 60.73(e), and 60.84(e)]. It is the responsibility of the source operator to maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the criterion on the waiver of RA testing. If this criterion is exceeded, the owner or operator must notify the Administrator within 10 days of such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the increasing emissions. The Administrator will review the notification and may rescind the waiver and require the owner or operator to conduct a RA test of the CEMS as specified in Section 8.4 of Performance Specification 2.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Modification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, any physical or operational change to an existing facility which results in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere of any pollutant to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification within the meaning of section 111 of the Act. Upon modification, an existing facility shall become an affected facility for each pollutant to which a standard applies and for which there is an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(b) Emission rate shall be expressed as kg/hr of any pollutant discharged into the atmosphere for which a standard is applicable. The Administrator shall use the following to determine emission rate:</P>
              <P>(1) Emission factors as specified in the latest issue of “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,” EPA Publication No. AP-42, or other emission factors determined by the Administrator to be superior to AP-42 emission factors, in cases where utilization of emission factors demonstrates that the emission level resulting from the physical or operational change will either clearly increase or clearly not increase.</P>

              <P>(2) Material balances, continuous monitor data, or manual emission tests in cases where utilization of emission factors as referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction whether the emission level resulting from the physical or operational change will either clearly increase or clearly not increase, or where an owner or operator demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds to dispute the result obtained by the Administrator utilizing emission factors as referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When the emission rate is based on results from manual emission tests or continuous monitoring systems, the procedures specified in appendix C of this part shall be used to determine whether an increase in emission rate has occurred. Tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the facility. At least three valid test runs must be conducted before and at least three after the physical or operational change. All operating parameters which may affect emissions must be held constant to the <PRTPAGE P="69"/>maximum feasible degree for all test runs.</P>
              <P>(c) The addition of an affected facility to a stationary source as an expansion to that source or as a replacement for an existing facility shall not by itself bring within the applicability of this part any other facility within that source.</P>
              <P>(d) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(e) The following shall not, by themselves, be considered modifications under this part:</P>
              <P>(1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement which the Administrator determines to be routine for a source category, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and § 60.15.</P>
              <P>(2) An increase in production rate of an existing facility, if that increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on that facility.</P>
              <P>(3) An increase in the hours of operation.</P>
              <P>(4) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material if, prior to the date any standard under this part becomes applicable to that source type, as provided by § 60.1, the existing facility was designed to accommodate that alternative use. A facility shall be considered to be designed to accommodate an alternative fuel or raw material if that use could be accomplished under the facility's construction specifications as amended prior to the change. Conversion to coal required for energy considerations, as specified in section 111(a)(8) of the Act, shall not be considered a modification.</P>
              <P>(5) The addition or use of any system or device whose primary function is the reduction of air pollutants, except when an emission control system is removed or is replaced by a system which the Administrator determines to be less environmentally beneficial.</P>
              <P>(6) The relocation or change in ownership of an existing facility.</P>
              <P>(f) Special provisions set forth under an applicable subpart of this part shall supersede any conflicting provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) Within 180 days of the completion of any physical or operational change subject to the control measures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, compliance with all applicable standards must be achieved.</P>
              <P>(h) No physical change, or change in the method of operation, at an existing electric utility steam generating unit shall be treated as a modification for the purposes of this section provided that such change does not increase the maximum hourly emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the maximum hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the 5 years prior to the change.</P>
              <P>(i) Repowering projects that are awarded funding from the Department of Energy as permanent clean coal technology demonstration projects (or similar projects funded by EPA) are exempt from the requirements of this section provided that such change does not increase the maximum hourly emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the maximum hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the five years prior to the change.</P>
              <P>(j)(1) Repowering projects that qualify for an extension under section 409(b) of the Clean Air Act are exempt from the requirements of this section, provided that such change does not increase the actual hourly emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the actual hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the 5 years prior to the change.</P>
              <P>(2) This exemption shall not apply to any new unit that:</P>
              <P>(i) Is designated as a replacement for an existing unit;</P>
              <P>(ii) Qualifies under section 409(b) of the Clean Air Act for an extension of an emission limitation compliance date under section 405 of the Clean Air Act; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Is located at a different site than the existing unit.</P>

              <P>(k) The installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a temporary clean coal technology demonstration project is exempt from the requirements of this section. A <E T="03">temporary clean coal control technology demonstration project,</E> for the purposes of this section is a clean coal technology demonstration project that is operated for a period of 5 years or less, and which complies with the State implementation plan for the State in which the project <PRTPAGE P="70"/>is located and other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards during the project and after it is terminated.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reconstruction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An existing facility, upon reconstruction, becomes an affected facility, irrespective of any change in emission rate.</P>
              <P>(b) “Reconstruction” means the replacement of components of an existing facility to such an extent that:</P>
              <P>(1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new facility, and</P>
              <P>(2) It is technologically and economically feasible to meet the applicable standards set forth in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) “Fixed capital cost” means the capital needed to provide all the depreciable components.</P>
              <P>(d) If an owner or operator of an existing facility proposes to replace components, and the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new facility, he shall notify the Administrator of the proposed replacements. The notice must be postmarked 60 days (or as soon as practicable) before construction of the replacements is commenced and must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) Name and address of the owner or operator.</P>
              <P>(2) The location of the existing facility.</P>
              <P>(3) A brief description of the existing facility and the components which are to be replaced.</P>
              <P>(4) A description of the existing air pollution control equipment and the proposed air pollution control equipment.</P>
              <P>(5) An estimate of the fixed capital cost of the replacements and of constructing a comparable entirely new facility.</P>
              <P>(6) The estimated life of the existing facility after the replacements.</P>
              <P>(7) A discussion of any economic or technical limitations the facility may have in complying with the applicable standards of performance after the proposed replacements.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator will determine, within 30 days of the receipt of the notice required by paragraph (d) of this section and any additional information he may reasonably require, whether the proposed replacement constitutes reconstruction.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator's determination under paragraph (e) shall be based on:</P>
              <P>(1) The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable entirely new facility;</P>
              <P>(2) The estimated life of the facility after the replacements compared to the life of a comparable entirely new facility;</P>
              <P>(3) The extent to which the components being replaced cause or contribute to the emissions from the facility; and</P>
              <P>(4) Any economic or technical limitations on compliance with applicable standards of performance which are inherent in the proposed replacements.</P>

              <P>(a) Concurrently upon or after proposal of standards of performance for the control of a designated pollutant from affected facilities, the Administrator will publish a draft guideline document containing information pertinent to control of the designated pollutant form designated facilities. Notice of the availability of the draft guideline document will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and public comments on its contents will be invited. After consideration of public comments and upon or after promulgation of standards of performance for control of a designated pollutant from affected facilities, a final guideline document will be published and notice of its availability will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Guideline documents published under this section will provide information for the development of State plans, such as:</P>
              <P>(1) Information concerning known or suspected endangerment of public health or welfare caused, or contributed to, by the designated pollutant.</P>
              <P>(2) A description of systems of emission reduction which, in the judgment of the Administrator, have been adequately demonstrated.</P>

              <P>(5) An emission guideline that reflects the application of the best system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) that has been adequately demonstrated for designated facilities, and the time within which compliance with emission standards of equivalent stringency can be achieved. The Administrator will specify different emission guidelines or compliance times or both for different sizes, types, and classes of designated facilities when costs of control, physical limitations, geographical location, or similar factors make subcategorization appropriate. (6) Such other available information as the Administrator determines may contribute to the formulation of State plans.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the emission guidelines and compliance times referred to in paragraph (b)(5) of this section will be proposed for comment upon publication of the draft guideline document, and after consideration of comments will be promulgated in subpart C of this part with such modifications as may be appropriate.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) If the Administrator determines that a designated pollutant may cause or contribute to endangerment of public welfare, but that adverse effects on public health have not been demonstrated, he will include the determination in the draft guideline document and in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of its availability. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, paragraph (c) of this section shall be inapplicable in such cases.</P>

              <P>(2) If the Administrator determines at any time on the basis of new information that a prior determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is incorrect or no longer correct, he will publish notice of the determination in <PRTPAGE P="92"/>the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> revise the guideline document as necessary under paragraph (a) of this section, and propose and promulgate emission guidelines and compliance times under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) Notification to the Administrator;</P>
              <P>(4) Notification to each local air pollution control agency in each region to which the plan or revision will apply; and</P>
              <P>(5) In the case of an interstate region, notification to any other State included in the region.</P>
              <P>(e) The State shall prepare and retain, for a minimum of 2 years, a record of each hearing for inspection by any interested party. The record shall contain, as a minimum, a list of witnesses together with the text of each presentation.</P>
              <P>(f) The State shall submit with the plan or revision:</P>
              <P>(1) Certification that each hearing required by paragraph (c) of this section was held in accordance with the notice required by paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) A list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.</P>

              <P>(g) Upon written application by a State agency (through the appropriate Regional Office), the Administrator may approve State procedures designed to insure public participation in the matters for which hearings are required and public notification of the opportunity to participate if, in the judgment of the Administrator, the procedures, although different from the requirements of this subpart, in fact provide for adequate notice to and participation of the public. The Administrator may impose such conditions on his approval as he deems necessary. Procedures approved under this section <PRTPAGE P="93"/>shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this subpart regarding procedures for public hearings.</P>

              <P>(a) Each plan shall include emission standards and compliance schedules.</P>
              <P>(b) (1) Emission standards shall either be based on an allowance system or prescribe allowable rates of emissions except when it is clearly impracticable. Such cases will be identified in the guideline documents issued under § 60.22. Where emission standards prescribing equipment specifications are established, the plan shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emission reductions achievable by implementation of such specifications, and may permit compliance by the use of equipment determined by the State to be equivalent to that prescribed.</P>
              <P>(2) Test methods and procedures for determining compliance with the emission standards shall be specified in the plan. Methods other than those specified in appendix A to this part may be specified in the plan if shown to be equivalent or alternative methods as defined in § 60.2 (t) and (u).</P>
              <P>(3) Emission standards shall apply to all designated facilities within the State. A plan may contain emission standards adopted by local jurisdictions provided that the standards are enforceable by the State.</P>

              <P>(d) Where the Administrator has determined that a designated pollutant may cause or contribute to endangerment of public welfare but that adverse effects on public health have not been demonstrated, States may balance the emission guidelines, compliance times, and other information provided in the applicable guideline document against other factors of public concern in establishing emission standards, compliance schedules, and variances. Appropriate consideration shall be given to the factors specified in § 60.22(b) and to information presented at the public hearing(s) conducted under § 60.23(c).</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Any compliance schedule extending more than 12 months from the date required for submittal of the plan must include legally enforceable increments of progress to achieve compliance for each designated facility or category of facilities. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, increments of progress must include, where practicable, each increment of progress specified in § 60.21(h) and must include such additional increments of progress as may be necessary to permit close and effective supervision of progress toward final compliance.</P>
              <P>(2) A plan may provide that compliance schedules for individual sources or categories of sources will be formulated after plan submittal. Any such schedule shall be the subject of a public hearing held according to § 60.23 and shall be submitted to the Administrator within 60 days after the date of adoption of the schedule but in no case later than the date prescribed for submittal of the first semiannual report required by § 60.25(e).</P>
              <P>(f) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart on a case-by-case basis for particular designated facilities or classes of facilities, States may provide for the application of less stringent emissions standards or longer compliance schedules than those otherwise required by paragraph (c) of this section, provided that the State demonstrates with respect to each such facility (or class of facilities):</P>
              <P>(1) Unreasonable cost of control resulting from plant age, location, or basic process design;</P>
              <P>(2) Physical impossibility of installing necessary control equipment; or</P>

              <P>(3) Other factors specific to the facility (or class of facilities) that make application of a less stringent standard or final compliance time significantly more reasonable.<PRTPAGE P="94"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to preclude any State or political subdivision thereof from adopting or enforcing (1) emission standards more stringent than emission guidelines specified in subpart C of this part or in applicable guideline documents or (2) compliance schedules requiring final compliance at earlier times than those specified in subpart C or in applicable guideline documents.</P>

              <P>(a) The designated facility to which the guidelines apply is each existing MSW landfill for which construction, reconstruction or modification was commenced before May 30, 1991.</P>
              <P>(b) Physical or operational changes made to an existing MSW landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing MSW landfill to the requirements of subpart WWW [see § 60.750 of subpart WWW].</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Act, the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters on the effective date of EPA approval of the State's program under section 111(d) of the Act, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of §§ 70.5(a)(1)(i) or 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter 90 days after the effective date of such 111(d) program approval, even if the design capacity report is submitted earlier.</P>

              <P>(d) When a MSW landfill subject to this subpart is closed, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements <PRTPAGE P="107"/>of either part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met.</P>
              <P>(1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control system under § 60.33c(c) of this subpart; or</P>

              <P>(a) For approval, a State plan shall include control of MSW landfill emissions at each MSW landfill meeting the following three conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) The landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987, or has additional design capacity available for future waste deposition;</P>
              <P>(2) The landfill has a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. Any density conversions shall be documented and submitted with the design capacity report; and</P>
              <P>(3) The landfill has a nonmethane organic compound emission rate of 50 megagrams per year or more.</P>
              <P>(b) For approval, a State plan shall include the installation of a collection and control system meeting the conditions provided in § 60.752(b)(2)(ii) of this part at each MSW landfill meeting the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section. The State plan shall include a process for State review and approval of the site-specific design plans for the gas collection and control system(s).</P>
              <P>(c) For approval, a State plan shall include provisions for the control of collected MSW landfill emissions through the use of control devices meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, except as provided in § 60.24.</P>
              <P>(1) An open flare designed and operated in accordance with the parameters established in § 60.18; or</P>
              <P>(2) A control system designed and operated to reduce NMOC by 98 weight percent; or</P>
              <P>(3) An enclosed combustor designed and operated to reduce the outlet NMOC concentration to 20 parts per million as hexane by volume, dry basis at 3 percent oxygen, or less.</P>
              <P>(d) For approval, a State plan shall require each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams by mass or 2.5 million cubic meters by volume to submit an initial design capacity report to the Administrator as provided in § 60.757(a)(2) of subpart WWW by the date specified in § 60.35c of this subpart. The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. Any density conversions shall be documented and submitted with the report. Submittal of the initial design capacity report shall fulfill the requirements of this subpart except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall submit an amended design capacity report as provided in § 60.757(a)(3) of subpart WWW. [Guidance: Note that if the design capacity increase is the result of a modification, as defined in § 60.751 of subpart WWW, that was commenced on or after May 30, 1991, the landfill will become subject to subpart WWW instead of this subpart. If the design capacity increase is the result of a change in operating practices, density, or some other change that is not a modification, the landfill remains subject to this subpart.]</P>
              <P>(2) When an increase in the maximum design capacity of a landfill with an initial design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters results in a revised maximum design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

              <P>(e) For approval, a State plan shall require each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters to either install a collection and control system as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and § 60.752(b)(2) of subpart WWW or calculate an initial NMOC emission rate <PRTPAGE P="108"/>for the landfill using the procedures specified in § 60.34c of this subpart and § 60.754 of subpart WWW. The NMOC emission rate shall be recalculated annually, except as provided in § 60.757(b)(1)(ii) of subpart WWW.</P>
              <P>(1) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Submit an annual emission report, except as provided for in § 60.757(b)(1)(ii); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the procedures specified in § 60.754(a)(1) of subpart WWW until such time as the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, or the landfill is closed.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If the NMOC emission rate, upon initial calculation or annual recalculation required in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall install a collection and control system as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and § 60.752(b)(2) of subpart WWW.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure notification shall be submitted to the Administrator as provided in § 60.35c of this subpart and § 60.757(d) of subpart WWW.</P>

              <P>This subpart establishes Emission Guidelines and compliance times for the control of designated pollutants from certain designated municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a state or United States protectorate with one or more existing MSW landfills that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction on or before July 17, 2014, you must submit a state plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the Emission Guidelines contained in this subpart. The requirements for state plans are specified in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) You must submit a state plan to EPA by May 30, 2017.</P>
              <P>(c) The following authorities will not be delegated to state, local, or tribal agencies:</P>
              <P>(1) Approval of alternative methods to determine the NMOC concentration or a site-specific methane generation rate constant (k).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Designated facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The designated facility to which these Emission Guidelines apply is each existing MSW landfill for which construction, reconstruction, or modification was commenced on or before July 17, 2014.</P>
              <P>(b) Physical or operational changes made to an existing MSW landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing MSW landfill to the requirements of a standard of performance for new MSW landfills.</P>

              <P>(c) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise <PRTPAGE P="120"/>subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters on the effective date of EPA approval of the state's program under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter 90 days after the effective date of such section 111(d) program approval, even if the design capacity report is submitted earlier.</P>
              <P>(d) When an MSW landfill subject to this subpart is closed as defined in this subpart, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement to install and operate a gas collection and control system under § 60.33f; or</P>

              <P>For approval, a state plan must include provisions for the operational standards in this section for an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 60.33f(b) and (c). Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 60.33f(b) and (c) must:</P>
              <P>(a) Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid waste has been in place for:</P>
              <P>(1) Five (5) years or more if active; or</P>
              <P>(2) Two (2) years or more if closed or at final grade.</P>
              <P>(b) Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each wellhead except under the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) A fire or increased well temperature. The owner or operator must record instances when positive pressure occurs in efforts to avoid a fire. These records must be submitted with the annual reports as provided in § 60.38f(h)(1).</P>
              <P>(2) Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator must develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan.</P>
              <P>(3) A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design changes must be approved by the Administrator as specified in § 60.38f(d).</P>

              <P>(c) Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a landfill gas temperature less than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature value at a particular well. A higher operating value demonstration must be submitted to the Administrator for approval and must include supporting data demonstrating that the elevated <PRTPAGE P="124"/>parameter neither causes fires nor significantly inhibits anaerobic decomposition by killing methanogens. The demonstration must satisfy both criteria in order to be approved (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> neither causing fires nor killing methanogens is acceptable).</P>
              <P>(d) Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration is less than 500 parts per million above background at the surface of the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or operator must conduct surface testing using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in § 60.36(d). The owner or operator must conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover and all cover penetrations. Thus, the owner or operator must monitor any openings that are within an area of the landfill where waste has been placed and a gas collection system is required. The owner or operator may establish an alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A surface monitoring design plan must be developed that includes a topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any site-specific deviations from the 30-meter intervals. Areas with steep slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface testing.</P>
              <P>(e) Operate the system such that all collected gases are vented to a control system designed and operated in compliance with § 60.33f(c). In the event the collection or control system is not operating, the gas mover system must be shut down and all valves in the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to the atmosphere must be closed within 1 hour of the collection or control system not operating.</P>
              <P>(f) Operate the control system at all times when the collected gas is routed to the system.</P>
              <P>(g) If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective action must be taken as specified in § 60.36f(a)(3) and (5) or (c). If corrective actions are taken as specified in § 60.36f, the monitored exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements in this section.</P>

The landfill owner or operator must install at least two sample probes per hectare, evenly distributed over the landfill surface that has retained waste for at least 2 years. If the landfill is larger than 25 hectares in area, only 50 samples are required. The probes should be evenly distributed across the sample area. The sample probes should be located to avoid known areas of nondegradable solid waste. The owner or operator must collect and analyze one sample of landfill gas from each probe to determine the NMOC concentration using Method 25 or 25C of appendix A of this part. Taking composite samples from different probes into a single cylinder is allowed; however, equal sample volumes must be taken from each probe. For each composite, the sampling rate, collection times, beginning and ending cylinder vacuums, or alternative volume measurements must be recorded to verify that composite volumes are equal. Composite sample volumes should not be less than one liter <PRTPAGE P="126"/>unless evidence can be provided to substantiate the accuracy of smaller volumes. Terminate compositing before the cylinder approaches ambient pressure where measurement accuracy diminishes. If more than the required number of samples is taken, all samples must be used in the analysis. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from Method 25 or 25C by six to convert from C<E T="52">NMOC</E> as carbon to C<E T="52">NMOC</E> as hexane. If the landfill has an active or passive gas removal system in place, Method 25 or 25C samples may be collected from these systems instead of surface probes provided the removal system can be shown to provide sampling as representative as the two sampling probe per hectare requirement. For active collection systems, samples may be collected from the common header pipe. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any gas moving, condensate removal, or treatment system equipment. For active collection systems, a minimum of three samples must be collected from the header pipe.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Design capacity report.</E> For existing MSW landfills subject to this subpart, the initial design capacity report must be submitted no later than 90 days after the effective date of EPA approval of the state's plan under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The initial design capacity report must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size and location of the landfill, and identifying all areas where solid waste may be landfilled according to the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill.</P>

              <P>(2) The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where the maximum design capacity is specified in the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, a copy of the permit specifying the maximum design capacity may be submitted as part of the report. If the maximum design capacity of the landfill is not specified in the permit, the maximum design capacity must be calculated using good engineering practices. The calculations must be provided, along with the relevant parameters as part of the report. The landfill may calculate design capacity in either <PRTPAGE P="135"/>megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually. Any density conversions must be documented and submitted with the design capacity report. The state, local, or tribal agency or the Administrator may request other reasonable information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design capacity of the landfill.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amended design capacity report.</E> An amended design capacity report must be submitted providing notification of an increase in the design capacity of the landfill, within 90 days of an increase in the maximum design capacity of the landfill to meet or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. This increase in design capacity may result from an increase in the permitted volume of the landfill or an increase in the density as documented in the annual recalculation required in § 60.39f(f).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">NMOC emission rate report.</E> For existing MSW landfills covered by this subpart with a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, the NMOC emission rate report must be submitted following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section no later than 90 days after the effective date of EPA approval of the state's plan under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The NMOC emission rate report must be submitted to the Administrator annually following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported NMOC emission rate.</P>
              <P>(1) The NMOC emission rate report must contain an annual or 5-year estimate of the NMOC emission rate calculated using the formula and procedures provided in § 60.35f(a) or (b), as applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) The NMOC emission rate report must include all the data, calculations, sample reports and measurements used to estimate the annual or 5-year emissions.</P>
              <P>(3) If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual report to the Administrator is less than 34 megagrams per year in each of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to submit, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period in lieu of the annual report. This estimate must include the current amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated waste acceptance rate for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based must be provided to the Administrator. This estimate must be revised at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year estimate, a revised 5-year estimate must be submitted to the Administrator. The revised estimate must cover the 5-year period beginning with the year in which the actual waste acceptance rate exceeded the estimated waste acceptance rate.</P>
              <P>(4) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart is exempted from the requirements to submit an NMOC emission rate report, after installing a collection and control system that complies with § 60.33f(b) and (c), during such time as the collection and control system is in operation and in compliance with §§ 60.34f and 60.36f.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Collection and control system design plan.</E> The state plan must include a process for state review and approval of the site-specific design plan for each gas collection and control system. The collection and control system design plan must be prepared and approved by a professional engineer and must meet the following requirements:</P>

              <P>(1) The collection and control system as described in the design plan must meet the design requirements in § 60.33f(b) and (c).<PRTPAGE P="136"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The collection and control system design plan must include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting provisions of §§ 60.34f through 60.39f proposed by the owner or operator.</P>
              <P>(3) The collection and control system design plan must either conform to specifications for active collection systems in § 60.40f or include a demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction of the sufficiency of the alternative provisions to § 60.40f.</P>
              <P>(4) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters must submit a copy of the collection and control system design plan cover page that contains the engineer's seal to the Administrator within 1 year of the first NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in § 60.35f(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year or the landfill is closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated NMOC emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, must be submitted, following the procedures in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 34 megagrams per year.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant k, as provided in Tier 3 in § 60.35f(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be used in the NMOC emission rate calculation until such time as the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of § 60.35f(a)(4) and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, to the Administrator within 1 year of the first calculated NMOC emission rate equaling or exceeding 34 megagrams per year.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the owner or operator elects to demonstrate that site-specific surface methane emissions are below 500 parts per million methane, based on the provisions of § 60.35f(a)(6), then the owner or operator must submit annually a Tier 4 surface emissions report as specified in this paragraph (d)(4)(iii) following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section until a surface emissions readings of 500 parts per million methane or greater is found. If the Tier 4 surface emissions report shows no surface emissions readings of 500 parts per million methane or greater for four consecutive quarters at a closed landfill, then the landfill owner or operator may reduce Tier 4 monitoring from a quarterly to an annual frequency. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported instantaneous surface emission readings. The Tier 4 surface emissions report must clearly identify the location, date and time (to the nearest second), average wind speeds including wind gusts, and reading (in parts per million) of any value 500 parts per million methane or greater, other than non-repeatable, momentary readings. For location, you must determine the latitude and longitude coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places. The Tier 4 surface emission report should also include the results of the most recent Tier 1 and Tier 2 results in order to verify that the landfill does not exceed 50 Mg/yr of NMOC.</P>

              <P>(A) The initial Tier 4 surface emissions report must be submitted annually, starting within 30 days of completing the fourth quarter of Tier 4 surface emissions monitoring that demonstrates that site-specific surface methane emissions are below 500 parts <PRTPAGE P="137"/>per million methane, and following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) The Tier 4 surface emissions rate report must be submitted within 1 year of the first measured surface exceedance of 500 parts per million methane, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the landfill is in the closed landfill subcategory, the owner or operator must submit a collection and control system design plan to the Administrator within 1 year of the first NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams per year, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in § 60.35f(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year or the landfill is closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated NMOC emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 50 megagrams per year.</P>
              <P>(B) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant k, as provided in Tier 3 in § 60.35f(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be used in the NMOC emission rate calculation until such time as the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of § 60.35f(a)(4) and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, to the Administrator within 1 year of the first calculated NMOC emission rate equaling or exceeding 50 megagrams per year.</P>
              <P>(C) The landfill owner or operator elects to demonstrate surface emissions are low, consistent with the provisions in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(D) The landfill has already submitted a gas collection and control system design plan consistent with the provisions of subpart WWW of this part; 40 CFR part 62, subpart GGG; or a state plan implementing subpart Cc of this part.</P>
              <P>(5) The landfill owner or operator must notify the Administrator that the design plan is completed and submit a copy of the plan's signature page. The Administrator has 90 days to decide whether the design plan should be submitted for review. If the Administrator chooses to review the plan, the approval process continues as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. However, if the Administrator indicates that submission is not required or does not respond within 90 days, the landfill owner or operator can continue to implement the plan with the recognition that the owner or operator is proceeding at their own risk. In the event that the design plan is required to be modified to obtain approval, the owner or operator must take any steps necessary to conform any prior actions to the approved design plan and any failure to do so could result in an enforcement action.</P>

              <P>(6) Upon receipt of an initial or revised design plan, the Administrator must review the information submitted under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section and either approve it, disapprove it, or request that additional information be submitted. Because of the many site-specific factors involved with landfill gas system design, alternative systems may be necessary. A wide variety of system designs are possible, such as vertical wells, combination horizontal and vertical collection systems, or horizontal trenches only, leachate collection components, and passive systems. If the Administrator does not approve or disapprove the design plan, or does not request that additional information be submitted within 90 days of receipt, then the owner or operator may continue with <PRTPAGE P="138"/>implementation of the design plan, recognizing they would be proceeding at their own risk.</P>
              <P>(7) If the owner or operator chooses to demonstrate compliance with the emission control requirements of this subpart using a treatment system as defined in this subpart, then the owner or operator must prepare a site-specific treatment system monitoring plan as specified in § 60.39f(b)(5).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Revised design plan.</E> The owner or operator who has already been required to submit a design plan under paragraph (d) of this section, or under subpart WWW of this part; 40 CFR part 62, subpart GGG; or a state plan implementing subpart Cc of this part, must submit a revised design plan to the Administrator for approval as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) At least 90 days before expanding operations to an area not covered by the previously approved design plan.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to installing or expanding the gas collection system in a way that is not consistent with the design plan that was submitted to the Administrator according to paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Closure report.</E> Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must submit a closure report to the Administrator within 30 days of ceasing waste acceptance. The Administrator may request additional information as may be necessary to verify that permanent closure has taken place in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 258.60. If a closure report has been submitted to the Administrator, no additional wastes may be placed into the landfill without filing a notification of modification as described under § 60.7(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Equipment removal report.</E> Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must submit an equipment removal report to the Administrator 30 days prior to removal or cessation of operation of the control equipment.</P>

              <P>(B) If the owner or operator is proposing to exclude, or cease gas collection and control from, nonproductive physically separated (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> separately lined) closed areas that already have gas collection systems, NMOC emissions from each physically separated closed area must be computed using either Equation 3 in § 60.35f or Equation 7 in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The values for k and C<E T="52">NMOC</E> determined in field testing must be used if field testing has been performed in determining the NMOC emission rate or the radii of influence (the distance from the well center to a point in the landfill where the pressure gradient applied by the blower or compressor approaches zero). If field testing has not been performed, the default values for k, L<E T="52">o</E>, and C<E T="52">NMOC</E> provided in § 60.35f or the alternative values from § 60.35f must be used. The mass of nondegradable solid waste contained within the given section may be subtracted from the total mass of the section when estimating emissions provided the nature, location, age, and amount of the nondegradable material is documented as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.33f(b) must construct the gas collection devices using the following equipment or procedures:</P>

Collection devices such as wells and horizontal collectors must be perforated to allow gas entry without head loss sufficient to impair performance across the intended extent of control. Perforations must be situated with regard to the need to prevent excessive air infiltration.</P>
              <P>(2) Vertical wells must be placed so as not to endanger underlying liners and must address the occurrence of water within the landfill. Holes and trenches constructed for piped wells and horizontal collectors must be of sufficient cross-section so as to allow for their proper construction and completion including, for example, centering of pipes and placement of gravel backfill. Collection devices must be designed so as not to allow indirect short circuiting of air into the cover or refuse into the collection system or gas into the air. Any gravel used around pipe perforations should be of a dimension so as not to penetrate or block perforations.</P>
              <P>(3) Collection devices may be connected to the collection header pipes below or above the landfill surface. The connector assembly must include a positive closing throttle valve, any necessary seals and couplings, access couplings and at least one sampling port. The collection devices must be constructed of PVC, HDPE, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous material of suitable thickness.</P>
              <P>(c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 60.33f(c) must convey the landfill gas to a control system in compliance with § 60.33f(c) through the collection header pipe(s). The gas mover equipment must be sized to handle the maximum gas generation flow rate expected over the intended use period of the gas moving equipment using the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) For existing collection systems, the flow data must be used to project the maximum flow rate. If no flow data exist, the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be used.</P>
              <P>(2) For new collection systems, the maximum flow rate must be in accordance with § 60.36f(a)(1).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emissions and fuel monitoring.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the applicable emissions standard shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) for measuring opacity and a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for measuring SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions, NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, and either oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>) or carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>) except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Certain of the CEMS and COMS requirements under paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to owners or operators under the following conditions:</P>

              <P>(1) For a fossil-fuel-fired steam generator that combusts only gaseous or liquid fossil fuel (excluding residual oil) with potential SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rates of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less and that does not use post-combustion technology to reduce emissions of SO<E T="52">2</E> or PM, COMS for measuring the opacity of emissions and CEMS for measuring SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions are not required if the owner or operator monitors SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions by fuel sampling and analysis or fuel receipts.</P>

              <P>(2) For a fossil-fuel-fired steam generator that does not use a flue gas desulfurization device, a CEMS for measuring SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions is not required if the owner or operator monitors SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions by fuel sampling and analysis.</P>

              <P>(3) Notwithstanding § 60.13(b), installation of a CEMS for NO<E T="52">X</E> may be delayed until after the initial performance tests under § 60.8 have been conducted. If the owner or operator demonstrates during the performance test that emissions of NO<E T="52">X</E> are less than 70 percent of the applicable standards in § 60.44, a CEMS for measuring NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions is not required. If the initial performance test results show that NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions are greater than 70 percent of the applicable standard, the owner or operator shall install a CEMS for NO<E T="52">X</E> within one year after the date of the initial performance tests under § 60.8 and comply with all other applicable monitoring requirements under this part.</P>

              <P>(4) If an owner or operator is not required to and elects not to install any CEMS for either SO<E T="52">2</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E>, a CEMS for measuring either O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E> is not required.</P>
              <P>(5) For affected facilities using a PM CEMS, a bag leak detection system to monitor the performance of a fabric filter (baghouse) according to the most current requirements in § 60.48Da of this part, or an ESP predictive model to monitor the performance of the ESP developed in accordance and operated according to the most current requirements in section § 60.48Da of this part a COMS is not required.</P>

              <P>(6) A COMS for measuring the opacity of emissions is not required for an affected facility that does not use post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) for reducing PM, SO<E T="52">2</E>, or carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, burns only gaseous fuels or fuel oils that contain less than or equal to 0.30 weight percent sulfur, and is operated such that emissions of CO to the atmosphere from the affected source are maintained at levels less than or equal to 0.15 lb/MMBtu on a boiler operating day average basis. Owners and operators of affected sources electing to comply with this paragraph must demonstrate compliance according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) You must monitor CO emissions using a CEMS according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="153"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) The CO CEMS must be installed, certified, maintained, and operated according to the provisions in § 60.58b(i)(3) of subpart Eb of this part.</P>
              <P>(B) Each 1-hour CO emissions average is calculated using the data points generated by the CO CEMS expressed in parts per million by volume corrected to 3 percent oxygen (dry basis).</P>
              <P>(C) At a minimum, valid 1-hour CO emissions averages must be obtained for at least 90 percent of the operating hours on a 30-day rolling average basis. The 1-hour averages are calculated using the data points required in § 60.13(h)(2).</P>
              <P>(D) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests for the CO CEMS must be performed in accordance with procedure 1 in appendix F of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must calculate the 1-hour average CO emissions levels for each boiler operating day by multiplying the average hourly CO output concentration measured by the CO CEMS times the corresponding average hourly flue gas flow rate and divided by the corresponding average hourly heat input to the affected source. The 24-hour average CO emission level is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of the hourly CO emission levels computed for each boiler operating day.</P>
              <P>(iii) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average CO emission level each boiler operating day excluding periods of affected source startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the 24-hour average CO emission level is greater than 0.15 lb/MMBtu, you must initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high emission incident and, take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or repair equipment to reduce the 24-hour average CO emission level to 0.15 lb/MMBtu or less.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must record the CO measurements and calculations performed according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section and any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and time during which the 24-hour average CO emission level was greater than 0.15 lb/MMBtu, and the date, time, and description of the corrective action.</P>
              <P>(7) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard under § 60.42 that elects to not use a COMS because the affected facility burns only fuels as specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, monitors PM emissions as specified under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, or monitors CO emissions as specified under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, shall conduct a performance test using Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11 to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limit in § 60.42 by April 29, 2011 or within 45 days after stopping use of an existing COMS, whichever is later, and shall comply with either paragraph (b)(7)(i), (b)(7)(ii), or (b)(7)(iii) of this section. The observation period for Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests may be reduced from 3 hours to 60 minutes if all 6-minute averages are less than 10 percent and all individual 15-second observations are less than or equal to 20 percent during the initial 60 minutes of observation. The permitting authority may exempt owners or operators of affected facilities burning only natural gas from the opacity monitoring requirements.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) or (b)(7)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator shall conduct subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance tests using the procedures in paragraph (b)(7) of this section according to the applicable schedule in paragraphs (b)(7)(i)(A) through (b)(7)(i)(D) of this section, as determined by the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test results.</P>
              <P>(A) If no visible emissions are observed, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 12 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later;</P>

              <P>(B) If visible emissions are observed but the maximum 6-minute average opacity is less than or equal to 5 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 6 calendar <PRTPAGE P="154"/>months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later;</P>
              <P>(C) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 5 percent but less than or equal to 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 3 calendar months from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted or within 45 days of the next day that fuel with an opacity standard is combusted, whichever is later; or</P>
              <P>(D) If the maximum 6-minute average opacity is greater than 10 percent, a subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test must be completed within 45 calendar days from the date that the most recent performance test was conducted.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.</P>

              <P>(A) The owner or operator shall conduct 10 minute observations (during normal operation) each operating day the affected facility fires fuel for which an opacity standard is applicable using Method 22 of appendix A-7 of this part and demonstrate that the sum of the occurrences of any visible emissions is not in excess of 5 percent of the observation period (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, 30 seconds per 10 minute period). If the sum of the occurrence of any visible emissions is greater than 30 seconds during the initial 10 minute observation, immediately conduct a 30 minute observation. If the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is greater than 5 percent of the observation period (i.e., 90 seconds per 30 minute period), the owner or operator shall either document and adjust the operation of the facility and demonstrate within 24 hours that the sum of the occurrence of visible emissions is equal to or less than 5 percent during a 30 minute observation (i.e., 90 seconds) or conduct a new Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test using the procedures in paragraph (b)(7) of this section within 45 calendar days according to the requirements in § 60.46(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(B) If no visible emissions are observed for 10 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable, observations can be reduced to once every 7 operating days during which an opacity standard is applicable. If any visible emissions are observed, daily observations shall be resumed.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the maximum 6-minute opacity is less than 10 percent during the most recent Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part performance test, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to performing subsequent Method 9 of appendix A-4 performance tests, elect to perform subsequent monitoring using a digital opacity compliance system according to a site-specific monitoring plan approved by the Administrator. The observations shall be similar, but not necessarily identical, to the requirements in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section. For reference purposes in preparing the monitoring plan, see OAQPS “Determination of Visible Emission Opacity from Stationary Sources Using Computer-Based Photographic Analysis Systems.” This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality and Planning Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emission Measurement Center Preliminary Methods.</P>
              <P>(8) A COMS for measuring the opacity of emissions is not required for an affected facility at which the owner or operator installs, calibrates, operates, and maintains a particulate matter continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS) according to the requirements specified in subpart UUUUU of part 63.</P>

              <P>(c) For performance evaluations under § 60.13(c) and calibration checks <PRTPAGE P="155"/>under § 60.13(d), the following procedures shall be used:</P>

              <P>(1) Methods 6, 7, and 3B of appendix A of this part, as applicable, shall be used for the performance evaluations of SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> continuous monitoring systems. Acceptable alternative methods for Methods 6, 7, and 3B of appendix A of this part are given in § 60.46(d).</P>
              <P>(2) Sulfur dioxide or nitric oxide, as applicable, shall be used for preparing calibration gas mixtures under Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part.</P>

              <P>(3) For affected facilities burning fossil fuel(s), the span value for a continuous monitoring system measuring the opacity of emissions shall be 80, 90, or 100 percent. For a continuous monitoring system measuring sulfur oxides or NO<E T="52">X</E> the span value shall be determined using one of the following procedures:</P>

              <P>(i) Except as provided under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> span values shall be determined as follows:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance provisions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced before May 4, 2011, the applicable PM emissions limit and opacity standard under § 60.42Da, SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limit under § 60.43Da, and NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limit under § 60.44Da apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011, the applicable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limit under § 60.43Da, NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limit <PRTPAGE P="174"/>under § 60.44Da, and NO<E T="52">X</E> plus CO emissions limit under § 60.45Da apply at all times. The applicable PM emissions limit and opacity standard under § 60.42Da apply at all times except during periods of startup and shutdown.</P>

              <P>(b) After the initial performance test required under § 60.8, compliance with the applicable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limit and percentage reduction requirements under § 60.43Da, NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limit under § 60.44Da, and NO<E T="52">X</E> plus CO emissions limit under § 60.45Da is based on the average emission rate for 30 successive boiler operating days. A separate performance test is completed at the end of each boiler operating day after the initial performance test, and a new 30-boiler operating day rolling average emission rate for both SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E> or NO<E T="52">X</E> plus CO as applicable, and a new percent reduction for SO<E T="52">2</E> are calculated to demonstrate compliance with the standards.</P>

              <P>(c) For the initial performance test required under § 60.8, compliance with the applicable SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limits and percentage reduction requirements under § 60.43Da, the NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limits under § 60.44Da, and the NO<E T="52">X</E> plus CO emissions limits under § 60.45Da is based on the average emission rates for SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>, CO, and percent reduction for SO<E T="52">2</E> for the first 30 successive boiler operating days. The initial performance test is the only test in which at least 30 days prior notice is required unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The initial performance test is to be scheduled so that the first boiler operating day of the 30 successive boiler operating days is completed within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial startup of the facility.</P>

              <P>(d) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced before May 4, 2011, compliance with applicable 30-boiler operating day rolling average SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limits is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of all hourly emission rates for SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> for the 30 successive boiler operating days, except for data obtained during startup, shutdown, or malfunction. For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011, compliance with applicable 30-boiler operating day rolling average SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limits is determined by dividing the sum of the SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions for the 30 successive boiler operating days by the sum of the gross energy output or net energy output, as applicable, for the 30 successive boiler operating days.</P>

              <P>(e) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced before May 4, 2011, compliance with applicable SO<E T="52">2</E> percentage reduction requirements is determined based on the average inlet and outlet SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rates for the 30 successive boiler operating days. For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011, compliance with applicable SO<E T="52">2</E> percentage reduction requirements is determined based on the “as fired” total potential emissions and the total outlet SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions for the 30 successive boiler operating days.</P>

              <P>(f) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced before May 4, 2011, compliance with the applicable daily average PM emissions limit is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of all hourly emission rates each boiler operating day, except for data obtained during startup, shutdown, or malfunction periods. Daily averages are only calculated for boiler operating days that have non-out-of-control data for at least 18 hours of unit operation during which the standard applies. Instead, all of the non-out-of-control hourly emission rates of the operating day(s) not meeting the minimum 18 hours non-out-of-control data daily average requirement are averaged with all of the non-out-of-control hourly emission rates of the next boiler operating day with 18 hours or more of non-out-of-control PM CEMS data to determine compliance. For affected facilities for which construction or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011 that elect to demonstrate compliance using PM CEMS, compliance with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da is determined on a 30-boiler operating day rolling average basis by <PRTPAGE P="175"/>calculating the arithmetic average of all hourly PM emission rates for the 30 successive boiler operating days, except for data obtained during periods of startup and shutdown.</P>

              <P>(g) For affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2011, compliance with applicable 30-boiler operating day rolling average NO<E T="52">X</E> plus CO emissions limit is determined by dividing the sum of the NO<E T="52">X</E> plus CO emissions for the 30 successive boiler operating days by the sum of the gross energy output or net energy output, as applicable, for the 30 successive boiler operating days.</P>
              <P>(h) If an owner or operator has not obtained the minimum quantity of emission data as required under § 60.49Da of this subpart, compliance of the affected facility with the emission requirements under §§ 60.43Da and 60.44Da of this subpart for the day on which the 30-day period ends may be determined by the Administrator by following the applicable procedures in section 7 of Method 19 of appendix A of this part.</P>

Alternatively, for oil-fired and gas-fired units, NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions may be calculated by multiplying the hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in lb/MMBtu (measured by the CEMS required under § 60.49Da(c) and (d)), by the hourly heat input rate (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(n)), and dividing the result by the average gross energy output (measured according to the provisions of § 60.49Da(k)) or the average hourly net energy output, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Compliance provisions for duct burners subject to § 60.44Da(a)(1).</E> To determine compliance with the emissions limits for NO<E T="52">X</E> required by § 60.44Da(a) for duct burners used in combined cycle systems, either of the procedures described in paragraph (j)(1) or (2) of this section may be used:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner shall conduct the performance test required under § 60.8 using the appropriate methods in appendix A of this part. Compliance with the emissions limits under § 60.44Da(a)(1) is determined on the average of three (nominal 1-hour) runs for the initial and subsequent performance tests. During the performance test, one sampling site shall be located in the exhaust of the turbine prior to the duct burner. A second sampling site shall be located at the outlet from the heat recovery steam generating unit. Measurements shall be taken at both sampling sites during the performance test; or</P>

              <P>(2) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner may elect to determine compliance by using the CEMS specified under § 60.49Da for measuring NO<E T="52">X</E> and oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>) (or carbon dioxide (CO<E T="52">2</E>)) and meet the requirements of § 60.49Da. Alternatively, data from a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, NO<E T="52">X</E>-diluent) CEMS certified according to the provisions of § 75.20(c) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, and meeting the quality assurance requirements of § 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, may be used, with the following caveats. Data used to meet the requirements of § 60.51Da shall not include substitute data values derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter. The sampling site shall be located at the outlet from the steam generating unit. The NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate at the outlet from the steam generating unit shall constitute the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate from the duct burner of the combined cycle system.</P>

              <P>(A) You must automatically (intrinsic to the opacity monitor) check the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least once daily. For a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and upscale calibration materials is as defined in the applicable version of Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.</P>
              <P>(B) You must adjust the zero and span whenever the 24-hour zero drift or 24-hour span drift exceeds 4 percent opacity. The COMS must allow for the amount of excess zero and span drift measured at the 24-hour interval checks to be recorded and quantified. The optical surfaces exposed to the effluent gases must be cleaned prior to performing the zero and span drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic zero adjustments. For systems using automatic zero adjustments, the optical surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation exceeds 4 percent opacity.</P>
              <P>(C) You must apply a method for producing a simulated zero opacity condition and an upscale (span) opacity condition using a certified neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known obscuration of the light beam. All procedures applied must provide a system check of the analyzer internal optical surfaces and all electronic circuitry including the lamp and photodetector assembly.</P>

              <P>(D) Except during periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, the COMS must be in continuous operation and must complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for <PRTPAGE P="179"/>each successive 10 second period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute period.</P>
              <P>(E) You must reduce all data from the COMS to 6-minute averages. Six-minute opacity averages must be calculated from 36 or more data points equally spaced over each 6-minute period. Data recorded during periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments must not be included in the data averages. An arithmetic or integrated average of all data may be used.</P>
              <P>(iii) During each performance test conducted according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section, you must establish an opacity baseline level. The value of the opacity baseline level is determined by averaging all of the 6-minute average opacity values (reported to the nearest 0.1 percent opacity) from the COMS measurements recorded during each of the test run intervals conducted for the performance test, and then adding 2.5 percent opacity to your calculated average opacity value for all of the test runs. If your opacity baseline level is less than 5.0 percent, then the opacity baseline level is set at 5.0 percent.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average opacity level measured by the COMS each boiler operating day excluding periods of affected facility startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the measured 24-hour average opacity emission level is greater than the baseline opacity level determined in paragraph (o)(2)(iii) of this section, you must initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high opacity incident and take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or repair equipment to reduce the measured 24-hour average opacity to a level below the baseline opacity level. In cases when a wet scrubber is used in combination with another PM control device that serves as the primary PM control device, the wet scrubber must be maintained and operated.</P>
              <P>(v) You must record the opacity measurements, calculations performed, and any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and time during which the measured 24-hour average opacity was greater than baseline opacity level, and the date, time, and description of the corrective action.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the measured 24-hour average opacity for your affected facility remains at a level greater than the opacity baseline level after 7 boiler operating days, then you must conduct a new PM performance test according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section and establish a new opacity baseline value according to paragraph (o)(2) of this section. This new performance test must be conducted within 60 days of the date that the measured 24-hour average opacity was first determined to exceed the baseline opacity level unless a waiver is granted by the permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(3) As an alternative to complying with the requirements of paragraph (o)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to monitor the performance of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) operated to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da using an ESP predictive model developed in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) You must calibrate the ESP predictive model with each PM control device used to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da operating under normal conditions. In cases when a wet scrubber is used in combination with an ESP to comply with the PM emissions limit, the wet scrubber must be maintained and operated.</P>

              <P>(ii) You must develop a site-specific monitoring plan that includes a description of the ESP predictive model used, the model input parameters, and the procedures and criteria for establishing monitoring parameter baseline levels indicative of compliance with the PM emissions limit. You must submit the site-specific monitoring plan for approval by the permitting authority. For reference purposes in preparing the monitoring plan, see the OAQPS “Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) Protocol for an Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) Controlling Particulate Matter (PM) Emissions from a Coal-Fired Boiler.” This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. <PRTPAGE P="180"/>EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emission Measurement Center Continuous Emission Monitoring.</P>
              <P>(iii) You must run the ESP predictive model using the applicable input data each boiler operating day and evaluate the model output for the preceding boiler operating day excluding periods of affected facility startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the values for one or more of the model parameters exceed the applicable baseline levels determined according to your approved site-specific monitoring plan, you must initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first discovery of a model parameter deviation and, take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or repair equipment to return the model output to within the applicable baseline levels.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must record the ESP predictive model inputs and outputs and any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and time during which the model output values exceeded the applicable baseline levels, and the date, time, and description of the corrective action.</P>
              <P>(v) If after 7 consecutive days a model parameter continues to exceed the applicable baseline level, then you must conduct a new PM performance test according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section. This new performance test must be conducted within 60 calendar days of the date that the model parameter was first determined to exceed its baseline level unless a waiver is granted by the permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(4) As an alternative to complying with the requirements of paragraph (o)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to monitor the performance of a fabric filter (baghouse) operated to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in § 60.42Da by using a bag leak detection system according to the requirements in paragraphs (o)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Each bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and requirements in paragraphs (o)(4)(i)(A) through (H) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.</P>
              <P>(B) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative PM loadings. The owner or operator must continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger.)</P>
              <P>(C) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will react when the system detects an increase in relative particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to paragraph (o)(4)(i)(D) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can be noticed by the appropriate plant personnel.</P>
              <P>(D) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm set points, and the alarm delay time.</P>
              <P>(E) Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the permitting authority except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section.</P>
              <P>(F) Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (o)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(G) You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the fabric filter and upstream of any wet scrubber.</P>
              <P>(H) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</P>

              <P>(ii) You must develop and submit to the permitting authority for approval a <PRTPAGE P="181"/>site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection system. You must operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs (o)(4)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Installation of the bag leak detection system;</P>
              <P>(B) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;</P>
              <P>(C) Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality assurance procedures;</P>
              <P>(D) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;</P>

              <P>(F) Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph (o)(4)(iii) of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring plan, the permitting authority may allow owners and operators more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that causes an alarm if the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring plan this specific condition as one that could lead to an alarm, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as expeditiously as practicable.</P>
              <P>(iii) For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate procedures to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the alarm. Except as provided in paragraph (o)(4)(ii)(F) of this section, you must alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in particulate emissions;</P>

In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in paragraph §§ 60.42Da, 60.43Da, 60.44Da, and 60.45Da, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at 40 CFR 60.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense as specified in paragraphs (s)(1) and (2) of this section. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</P>
              <P>(1) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (s)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</P>
              <P>(i) The excess emissions:</P>
              <P>(A) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and</P>

              <P>(iv) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and</P>
              <P>(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and</P>

              <P>(vii) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and</P>
              <P>(viii) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</P>
              <P>(ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue.

              <P>(a) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the opacity standard in § 60.42Da must monitor the opacity of emissions discharged from the affected facility to the atmosphere according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(2) and (4) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an opacity standard, shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a COMS, and record the output of the system, for measuring the opacity of emissions discharged to the atmosphere. If opacity interference due to water droplets exists in the stack (for example, from the use of an FGD system), the opacity is monitored upstream of the interference (at the inlet to the FGD system). If opacity interference is experienced at all locations (both at the inlet and outlet of the SO<E T="52">2</E> control system), alternate parameters indicative of the PM control system's performance and/or good combustion are monitored (subject to the approval of the Administrator).</P>
              <P>(2) As an alternative to the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an owner or operator of an affected facility that meets the conditions in either paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may elect to monitor opacity as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The affected facility uses a fabric filter (baghouse) to meet the standards in § 60.42Da and a bag leak detection system is installed and operated according to the requirements in paragraphs § 60.48Da(o)(4)(i) through (v);</P>

              <P>(ii) The affected facility burns only gaseous or liquid fuels (excluding residual oil) with potential SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rates of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less, and does not use a post-combustion technology to reduce emissions of SO<E T="52">2</E> or PM;</P>

              <P>(C) Emissions of CO discharged to the atmosphere are maintained at levels less than or equal to 1.4 lb/MWh on a boiler operating day average basis as demonstrated by the use of a CEMS measuring CO emissions according to the procedures specified in paragraph (u) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The affected facility uses an ESP and uses an ESP predictive model to monitor the performance of the ESP developed in accordance and operated according to the most current requirements in section § 60.48Da of this part.</P>

              <P>(3) The owner or operator of an affected facility that meets the conditions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may, as an alternative to using a COMS, elect to monitor visible emissions using the applicable procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section. The opacity performance test requirement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) must be conducted by <PRTPAGE P="185"/>April 29, 2011, within 45 days after stopping use of an existing COMS, or within 180 days after initial startup of the facility, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator shall conduct a performance test using Method 9 of appendix A-4 of this part and the procedures in § 60.11.

              <P>(e) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:</P>
              <P>(1) For Method 5 or 5B of appendix A-3 of this part, Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part may be used at facilities with or without wet FGD systems if the stack temperature at the sampling location does not exceed an average temperature of 160 °C (320 °F). The procedures of sections 8.1 and 11.1 of Method 5B of appendix A-3 of this part may be used in Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part only if it is used after wet FGD systems. Method 17 of appendix A-6 of this part shall not be used after wet FGD systems if the effluent is saturated or laden with water droplets.</P>
              <P>(2) The F<E T="52">c</E> factor (CO<E T="52">2</E>) procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part may be used to compute the emission rate of PM under the stipulations of § 60.46(d)(1). The CO<E T="52">2</E> shall be determined in the same manner as the O<E T="52">2</E> concentration.</P>

              <P>(f) The owner or operator of an electric utility combined cycle gas turbine that does not meet the definition of an IGCC must conduct performance tests for PM, SO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> using the procedures of Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part. The SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates calculations from the gas turbine used in Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part are determined when the gas turbine is performance tested under subpart GG of this part. The potential <PRTPAGE P="194"/>uncontrolled PM emission rate from a gas turbine is defined as 17 ng/J (0.04 lb/MMBtu) heat input.</P>

              <P>(d) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that simultaneously combusts natural gas and/or distillate oil with a potential SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions rate of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less with wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other solid fuel, except coal, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain NO<E T="52">X</E> in excess of 130 ng/J (0.30 lb/MMBtu) heat input unless the affected facility has an annual capacity factor for natural gas, distillate oil, or a mixture of these fuels of 10 percent (0.10) or less and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement that limits operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent (0.10) or less for natural gas, distillate oil, or a mixture of these fuels.</P>

              <P>(e) Except as provided under paragraph (l) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that simultaneously combusts only coal, oil, or natural gas with byproduct/waste shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain NO<E T="52">X</E> in excess of the emission limit determined by the following formula unless the affected facility has an annual capacity factor for coal, oil, and natural gas of 10 percent (0.10) or less and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement that limits operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent (0.10) or less:</P>

              <P>(f) Any owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts byproduct/waste with either natural gas or oil may petition the Administrator within 180 days of the initial startup of the affected facility to establish a NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit that shall apply specifically to that affected facility when the byproduct/waste is combusted. The petition shall include sufficient and appropriate data, as determined by the Administrator, such as NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions from the affected facility, waste composition (including nitrogen content), and combustion conditions to allow the Administrator to confirm that the affected facility is unable to comply with the emission limits in paragraph (e) of this section and to determine the appropriate emission limit for the affected facility.</P>

              <P>(1) Any owner or operator of an affected facility petitioning for a facility-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit under this section shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Demonstrate compliance with the emission limits for natural gas and distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, by conducting a 30-day performance test as provided in § 60.46b(e). During the performance test only natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil shall be combusted in the affected facility; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Demonstrate that the affected facility is unable to comply with the <PRTPAGE P="208"/>emission limits for natural gas and distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, when gaseous or liquid byproduct/waste is combusted in the affected facility under the same conditions and using the same technological system of emission reduction applied when demonstrating compliance under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limits for natural gas or distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, shall be applicable to the affected facility until and unless the petition is approved by the Administrator. If the petition is approved by the Administrator, a facility-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit will be established at the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission level achievable when the affected facility is combusting oil or natural gas and byproduct/waste in a manner that the Administrator determines to be consistent with minimizing NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions. In lieu of amending this subpart, a letter will be sent to the facility describing the facility-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> limit. The facility shall use the compliance procedures detailed in the letter and make the letter available to the public. If the Administrator determines it is appropriate, the conditions and requirements of the letter can be reviewed and changed at any point.</P>

              <P>(g) Any owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts hazardous waste (as defined by 40 CFR part 261 or 40 CFR part 761) with natural gas or oil may petition the Administrator within 180 days of the initial startup of the affected facility for a waiver from compliance with the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit that applies specifically to that affected facility. The petition must include sufficient and appropriate data, as determined by the Administrator, on NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions from the affected facility, waste destruction efficiencies, waste composition (including nitrogen content), the quantity of specific wastes to be combusted and combustion conditions to allow the Administrator to determine if the affected facility is able to comply with the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limits required by this section. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall demonstrate that when hazardous waste is combusted in the affected facility, thermal destruction efficiency requirements for hazardous waste specified in an applicable federally enforceable requirement preclude compliance with the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limits of this section. The NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limits for natural gas or distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, are applicable to the affected facility until and unless the petition is approved by the Administrator. (See 40 CFR 761.70 for regulations applicable to the incineration of materials containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).) In lieu of amending this subpart, a letter will be sent to the facility describing the facility-specific NO<E T="52">X</E> limit. The facility shall use the compliance procedures detailed in the letter and make the letter available to the public. If the Administrator determines it is appropriate, the conditions and requirements of the letter can be reviewed and changed at any point.</P>

              <P>(h) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, the NO<E T="52">X</E> standards under this section apply at all times including periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided under paragraph (j) of this section, compliance with the emission limits under this section is determined on a 30-day rolling average basis.</P>
              <P>(j) Compliance with the emission limits under this section is determined on a 24-hour average basis for the initial performance test and on a 3-hour average basis for subsequent performance tests for any affected facilities that:</P>
              <P>(1) Combust, alone or in combination, only natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less;</P>
              <P>(2) Have a combined annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less for natural gas, distillate oil, and residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less; and</P>

              <P>(3) Are subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to the firing of natural gas, distillate oil, and/or residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 <PRTPAGE P="209"/>weight percent or less and limiting operation of the affected facility to a combined annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less for natural gas, distillate oil, and residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less.</P>

              <P>(k) Affected facilities that meet the criteria described in paragraphs (j)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, and that have a heat input capacity of 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less, are not subject to the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limits under this section.</P>
              <P>(l) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under 60.8, whichever date is first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction after July 9, 1997 shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain NOx (expressed as NO2) in excess of the following limits:</P>
              <P>(1) 86 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts coal, oil, or natural gas (or any combination of the three), alone or with any other fuels. The affected facility is not subject to this limit if it is subject to and in compliance with a federally enforceable requirement that limits operation of the facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent (0.10) or less for coal, oil, and natural gas (or any combination of the three); or</P>
              <P>(2) If the affected facility has a low heat release rate and combusts natural gas or distillate oil in excess of 30 percent of the heat input on a 30-day rolling average from the combustion of all fuels, a limit determined by use of the following formula:</P>

              <P>(5) The owner or operator of an affected facility that qualifies under the provisions of § 60.42b(d) does not have to measure parameters E<E T="52">w</E> or X<E T="52">k</E> in paragraph (c)(3) of this section if the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to measure SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rates of the coal or oil following the fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 19 of appendix A-7 of this part.</P>

              <P>(d) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts only very low sulfur oil, natural gas, or a mixture of these fuels, has an annual capacity factor for oil of 10 percent (0.10) or less, and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor for oil of 10 percent (0.10) or less shall:<PRTPAGE P="211"/>

This demonstration will be made during the initial performance test and a subsequent demonstration may be requested at any other time. If the 24-hour average firing rate for the affected facility is less than the maximum design capacity provided by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the 24-hour average firing rate shall be used to determine the capacity utilization rate for the affected facility, otherwise the maximum design capacity provided by the manufacturer is used.</P>

              <P>(f) For the initial performance test required under § 60.8, compliance with the SO<E T="52">2</E> emission limits and percent reduction requirements under § 60.42b is based on the average emission rates and the average percent reduction for SO<E T="52">2</E> for the first 30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days, except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section. The initial performance test is the only test for which at least 30 days prior notice is required unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The initial performance test is to be scheduled so that the first steam generating unit operating day of the 30 successive steam generating unit operating days is completed within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial startup of the facility. The boiler load during the 30-day period does not have to be the maximum design load, but must be representative of future operating conditions and include at least one 24-hour period at full load.</P>

              <P>(g) After the initial performance test required under § 60.8, compliance with the SO<E T="52">2</E> emission limits and percent reduction requirements under § 60.42b is based on the average emission rates and the average percent reduction for SO<E T="52">2</E> for 30 successive steam generating unit operating days, except as provided under paragraph (d).

              <P>(h) Except as provided under paragraph (i) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall use all valid SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions data in calculating %P<E T="52">s</E> and E<E T="52">ho</E> under paragraph (c), of this section whether or not the minimum emissions data requirements under § 60.46b are achieved. All valid emissions data, including valid SO<E T="52">2</E> emission data collected during periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction, shall be used in calculating %P<E T="52">s</E> and E<E T="52">ho</E> pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) During periods of malfunction or maintenance of the SO<E T="52">2</E> control systems when oil is combusted as provided under § 60.42b(i), emission data are not used to calculate %P<E T="52">s</E> or E<E T="52">s</E> under § 60.42b(a), (b) or (c), however, the emissions data are used to determine compliance with the emission limit under § 60.42b(i).</P>

              <P>(7) Method 9 of appendix A of this part is used for determining the opacity of stack emissions.</P>

              <P>(e) To determine compliance with the emission limits for NO<E T="52">X</E> required under § 60.44b, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct the performance test as required under § 60.8 using the continuous system for monitoring NO<E T="52">X</E> under § 60.48(b).</P>
              <P>(1) For the initial compliance test, NO<E T="52">X</E> from the steam generating unit are monitored for 30 successive steam generating unit operating days and the 30-day average emission rate is used to determine compliance with the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standards under § 60.44b. The 30-day average emission rate is calculated as the average of all hourly emissions data recorded by the monitoring system during the 30-day test period.</P>

              <P>(2) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed <PRTPAGE P="213"/>or is required to be completed in § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility which combusts coal (except as specified under § 60.46b(e)(4)) or which combusts residual oil having a nitrogen content greater than 0.30 weight percent shall determine compliance with the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standards in § 60.44b on a continuous basis through the use of a 30-day rolling average emission rate.

              <P>(3) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility that has a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) and that combusts natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil having a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less shall determine compliance with the NO<E T="52">X</E> standards under § 60.44b on a continuous basis through the use of a 30-day rolling average emission rate. A new 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated each steam generating unit operating day as the average of all of the hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.</P>

              <P>(4) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility that has a heat input capacity of 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less and that combusts natural gas, distillate oil, gasified coal, or residual oil having a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less shall upon request determine compliance with the NO<E T="52">X</E> standards in § 60.44b through the use of a 30-day performance test. During periods when performance tests are not requested, NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions data collected pursuant to § 60.48b(g)(1) or § 60.48b(g)(2) are used to calculate a 30-day rolling average emission rate on a daily basis and used to prepare excess emission reports, but will not be used to determine compliance with the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standards. A new 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated each steam generating unit operating day as the average of all of the hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.</P>
              <P>(5) If the owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts residual oil does not sample and analyze the residual oil for nitrogen content, as specified in § 60.49b(e), the requirements of § 60.48b(g)(1) apply and the provisions of § 60.48b(g)(2) are inapplicable.</P>

              <P>(f) To determine compliance with the emissions limits for NO<E T="52">X</E> required by § 60.44b(a)(4) or § 60.44b(l) for duct burners used in combined cycle systems, either of the procedures described in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section may be used:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emission monitoring for sulfur dioxide.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the SO<E T="52">2</E> standards in § 60.42b shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate <PRTPAGE P="216"/>CEMS for measuring SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations and either O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations and shall record the output of the systems. For units complying with the percent reduction standard, the SO<E T="52">2</E> and either O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations shall both be monitored at the inlet and outlet of the SO<E T="52">2</E> control device. If the owner or operator has installed and certified SO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> or CO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS according to the requirements of § 75.20(c)(1) of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, and is continuing to meet the ongoing quality assurance requirements of § 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, those CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) When relative accuracy testing is conducted, SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration data and CO<E T="52">2</E> (or O<E T="52">2</E>) data are collected simultaneously; and</P>
              <P>(2) In addition to meeting the applicable SO<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> (or O<E T="52">2</E>) relative accuracy specifications in Figure 2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the relative accuracy (RA) standard in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part is met when the RA is calculated on a lb/MMBtu basis; and</P>

              <P>(3) The reporting requirements of § 60.49b are met. SO<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> (or O<E T="52">2</E>) data used to meet the requirements of § 60.49b shall not include substitute data values derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the SO<E T="52">2</E> data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(b) As an alternative to operating CEMS as required under paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the average SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions and percent reduction by:</P>

              <P>(1) Collecting coal or oil samples in an as-fired condition at the inlet to the steam generating unit and analyzing them for sulfur and heat content according to Method 19 of appendix A of this part. Method 19 of appendix A of this part provides procedures for converting these measurements into the format to be used in calculating the average SO<E T="52">2</E> input rate, or</P>
              <P>(2) Measuring SO<E T="52">2</E> according to Method 6B of appendix A of this part at the inlet or outlet to the SO<E T="52">2</E> control system. An initial stratification test is required to verify the adequacy of the sampling location for Method 6B of appendix A of this part. The stratification test shall consist of three paired runs of a suitable SO<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> measurement train operated at the candidate location and a second similar train operated according to the procedures in Section 3.2 and the applicable procedures in Section 7 of Performance Specification 2. Method 6B of appendix A of this part, Method 6A of appendix A of this part, or a combination of Methods 6 and 3 or 3B of appendix A of this part or Methods 6C or Method 320 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter and 3A of appendix A of this part are suitable measurement techniques. If Method 6B of appendix A of this part is used for the second train, sampling time and timer operation may be adjusted for the stratification test as long as an adequate sample volume is collected; however, both sampling trains are to be operated similarly. For the location to be adequate for Method 6B of appendix A of this part, 24-hour tests, the mean of the absolute difference between the three paired runs must be less than 10 percent.</P>
              <P>(3) A daily SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate, E<E T="52">D</E>, shall be determined using the procedure described in Method 6A of appendix A of this part, section 7.6.2 (Equation 6A-8) and stated in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) heat input.</P>
              <P>(4) The mean 30-day emission rate is calculated using the daily measured values in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) for 30 successive steam generating unit operating days using equation 19-20 of Method 19 of appendix A of this part.</P>

              <P>(c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain emission data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours in at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days. If this minimum data requirement is not met with a single monitoring system, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall supplement the emission data with data collected with other monitoring systems as approved by the Administrator or the reference methods <PRTPAGE P="217"/>and procedures as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The 1-hour average SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rates measured by the CEMS required by paragraph (a) of this section and required under § 60.13(h) is expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and is used to calculate the average emission rates under § 60.42(b). Each 1-hour average SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate must be based on 30 or more minutes of steam generating unit operation. The hourly averages shall be calculated according to § 60.13(h)(2). Hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rates are not calculated if the affected facility is operated less than 30 minutes in a given clock hour and are not counted toward determination of a steam generating unit operating day.</P>
              <P>(e) The procedures under § 60.13 shall be followed for installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS.</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, all CEMS shall be operated in accordance with the applicable procedures under Performance Specifications 1, 2, and 3 of appendix B of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided for in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests shall be performed in accordance with Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part.</P>

              <P>(3) For affected facilities combusting coal or oil, alone or in combination with other fuels, the span value of the SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS at the inlet to the SO<E T="52">2</E> control device is 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions of the fuel combusted, and the span value of the CEMS at the outlet to the SO<E T="52">2</E> control device is 50 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions of the fuel combusted. Alternatively, SO<E T="52">2</E> span values determined according to section 2.1.1 in appendix A to part 75 of this chapter may be used.</P>
              <P>(4) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, the owner or operator may elect to implement the following alternative data accuracy assessment procedures:</P>
              <P>(i) For all required CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> monitors and for SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> monitors with span values greater than or equal to 100 ppm, the daily calibration error test and calibration adjustment procedures described in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter may be followed instead of the CD assessment procedures in Procedure 1, section 4.1 of appendix F to this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) For all required CO<E T="52">2</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> monitors and for SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> monitors with span values greater than 30 ppm, quarterly linearity checks may be performed in accordance with section 2.2.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, instead of performing the cylinder gas audits (CGAs) described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2 of appendix F to this part. If this option is selected: The frequency of the linearity checks shall be as specified in section 2.2.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable linearity specifications in section 3.2 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 2.2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.2.4 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the cylinder gas audits described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2 of appendix F to this part shall be performed for SO<E T="52">2</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> span values less than or equal to 30 ppm; and</P>
              <P>(iii) For SO<E T="52">2</E>, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and O<E T="52">2</E> monitoring systems and for NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate monitoring systems, RATAs may be performed in accordance with section 2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter instead of following the procedures described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.1 of appendix F to this part. If this option is selected: The frequency of each RATA shall be as specified in section 2.3.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable relative accuracy specifications shown in Figure 2 in appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 2.3.2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.3.3 <PRTPAGE P="218"/>of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the relative accuracy specification in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part shall be met on a lb/MMBtu basis for SO<E T="52">2</E> (regardless of the SO<E T="52">2</E> emission level during the RATA), and for NO<E T="52">X</E> when the average NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate measured by the reference method during the RATA is less than 0.100 lb/MMBtu.</P>
              <P>(f) The owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts very low sulfur oil or is demonstrating compliance under § 60.45b(k) is not subject to the emission monitoring requirements under paragraph (a) of this section if the owner or operator maintains fuel records as described in § 60.49b(r).</P>

Section 60.8(f) does not apply to this section. The 30-day notice required in § 60.8(d) applies only to the initial performance test unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(b) The initial performance test required under § 60.8 shall be conducted over 30 consecutive operating days of the steam generating unit. Compliance with the percent reduction requirements and SO<E T="52">2</E> emission limits under § 60.42c shall be determined using a 30-day average. The first operating day included in the initial performance test shall be scheduled within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affect facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after the initial startup of the facility. The steam generating unit load during the 30-day period does not have to be the maximum design heat input capacity, but must be representative of future operating conditions.</P>

              <P>(c) After the initial performance test required under paragraph (b) of this section and § 60.8, compliance with the percent reduction requirements and SO<E T="52">2</E> emission limits under § 60.42c is based on the average percent reduction and the average SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rates for 30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days. A separate performance test is completed at the end of each steam generating unit operating day, and a new 30-day average percent reduction and SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate are calculated to show compliance with the standard.</P>

              <P>(d) If only coal, only oil, or a mixture of coal and oil is combusted in an affected facility, the procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part are used to determine the hourly SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate (E<E T="52">ho</E>) and the 30-day average SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate (E<E T="52">ao</E>). The hourly averages used to compute the 30-day averages are obtained from the CEMS. Method 19 of appendix A of this part shall be used to calculate E<E T="52">ao</E> when using daily fuel sampling or Method 6B of appendix A of this part.</P>

              <P>(d) As an alternative to operating a CEMS at the inlet to the SO<E T="52">2</E> control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if no SO<E T="52">2</E> control device is used) as required under paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the average SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate by sampling the fuel prior to combustion. As an alternative to operating a CEMS at the outlet from the SO<E T="52">2</E> control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if no SO<E T="52">2</E> control device is used) as required under paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the average SO<E T="52">2</E> emission rate by using Method 6B of appendix A of this part.

Method 6B of appendix A of this part shall be conducted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) For affected facilities combusting coal or oil, coal or oil samples shall be collected daily in an as-fired condition at the inlet to the steam generating unit and analyzed for sulfur content and heat content according the Method 19 of appendix A of this part. Method 19 of appendix A of this part provides procedures for converting these measurements into the format to be used in calculating the average SO<E T="52">2</E> input rate.</P>
              <P>(2) As an alternative fuel sampling procedure for affected facilities combusting oil, oil samples may be collected from the fuel tank for each steam generating unit immediately after the fuel tank is filled and before any oil is combusted. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall analyze the oil sample to determine the sulfur content of the oil. If a partially empty fuel tank is refilled, a new sample and analysis of the fuel in the tank would be required upon filling. Results of the fuel analysis taken after each new shipment of oil is received shall be used as the daily value when calculating the 30-day rolling average until the next shipment is received. If the fuel analysis shows that the sulfur content in the fuel tank is greater than 0.5 weight percent sulfur, the owner or operator shall ensure that the sulfur content of subsequent oil shipments is low enough to cause the 30-day rolling average sulfur content to be 0.5 weight percent sulfur or less.</P>

              <P>(3) Method 6B of appendix A of this part may be used in lieu of CEMS to measure SO<E T="52">2</E> at the inlet or outlet of the SO<E T="52">2</E> control system. An initial stratification test is required to verify the adequacy of the Method 6B of appendix A of this part sampling location. The stratification test shall consist of three paired runs of a suitable SO<E T="52">2</E> and CO<E T="52">2</E> measurement train operated at the candidate location and a second similar train operated according to the procedures in § 3.2 and the applicable procedures in section 7 of Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part. Method 6B of appendix A of this part, Method 6A of appendix A of this part, or a combination of Methods 6 and 3 of appendix A of this part or Methods 6C and 3A of appendix A of this part are suitable measurement techniques. If Method 6B of appendix A of this part is used for the second train, sampling time and timer operation may be adjusted for the <PRTPAGE P="242"/>stratification test as long as an adequate sample volume is collected; however, both sampling trains are to be operated similarly. For the location to be adequate for Method 6B of appendix A of this part 24-hour tests, the mean of the absolute difference between the three paired runs must be less than 10 percent (0.10).</P>

              <P>(e) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section shall not apply to affected facilities subject to § 60.42c(h) (1), (2), or (3) where the owner or operator of the affected facility seeks to demonstrate compliance with the SO<E T="52">2</E> standards based on fuel supplier certification, as described under § 60.48c(f), as applicable.</P>
              <P>(f) The owner or operator of an affected facility operating a CEMS pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or conducting as-fired fuel sampling pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall obtain emission data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours in at least 22 out of 30 successive steam generating unit operating days. If this minimum data requirement is not met with a single monitoring system, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall supplement the emission data with data collected with other monitoring systems as approved by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(c) No owner or operator of an affected facility shall allow the facility to be operated at any time unless one of the following persons is on duty and at the affected facility: A fully certified chief facility operator, a provisionally certified chief facility operator who is scheduled to take the full certification exam according to the schedule specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a fully certified shift supervisor, or a provisionally certified shift supervisor who is scheduled to take the full certification exam according to the schedule specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) The requirement specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall take effect 6 months after the date of startup <PRTPAGE P="274"/>of the affected facility or on December 19, 1996, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(2) If both the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are unavailable, a provisionally certified control room operator on site at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are away, the owner or operator of the affected facility must meet one of three criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are both off site for 12 hours or less, and no other certified operator is on site, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform the duties of the certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are off site for more than 12 hours, but for two weeks or less, and no other certified operator is on site, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform the duties of the certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator. However, the owner or operator of the affected facility must record the period when the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are off site and include that information in the annual report as specified under § 60.59b(g)(5).</P>
              <P>(iii) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are off site for more than two weeks, and no other certified operator is on site, the provisionally certified control room operator may perform the duties of the certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor without approval by the Administrator. However, the owner or operator of the affected facility must take two actions:</P>
              <P>(A) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what caused the absence and what actions are being taken by the owner or operator of the facility to ensure that a certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is on site as expeditiously as practicable.</P>
              <P>(B) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the Administrator every four weeks following the initial notification. If the Administrator provides notice that the status report or corrective action summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may continue.</P>
              <P>(3) A provisionally certified operator who is newly promoted or recently transferred to a shift supervisor position or a chief facility operator position at the municipal waste combustion unit may perform the duties of the certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator for up to six months before taking the ASME QRO certification exam.</P>

              <P>The owner or operator of an affected facility shall prepare a waste management plan. The waste management plan shall identify both the feasibility and the approach to separate certain components of solid waste from the health care waste stream in order to reduce the amount of toxic emissions from incinerated waste. A waste management plan may include, but is not limited to, elements such as segregation and recycling of paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, batteries, food waste, and metals (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> aluminum cans, metals-containing devices); segregation of non-recyclable wastes (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> polychlorinated biphenyl-containing waste, pharmaceutical waste, and mercury-containing waste, such as dental <PRTPAGE P="315"/>waste); and purchasing recycled or recyclable products. A waste management plan may include different goals or approaches for different areas or departments of the facility and need not include new waste management goals for every waste stream. It should identify, where possible, reasonably available additional waste management measures, taking into account the effectiveness of waste management measures already in place, the costs of additional measures, the emissions reductions expected to be achieved, and any other environmental or energy impacts they might have. The American Hospital Association publication entitled “An Ounce of Prevention: Waste Reduction Strategies for Health Care Facilities” (incorporated by reference, <E T="03">see</E> § 60.17) shall be considered in the development of the waste management plan. The owner or operator of each commercial HMIWI company shall conduct training and education programs in waste segregation for each of the company's waste generator clients and ensure that each client prepares its own waste management plan that includes, but is not limited to, the provisions listed previously in this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Each triboelectric bag leak detection system may be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained according to the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance,” (EPA-454/R-98-015, September 1997). This document is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy Group (D-243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emissions Measurement Center Continuous Emissions Monitoring. Other types of bag leak detection systems shall be installed, operated, calibrated, and maintained in a manner consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.</P>
              <P>(2) The bag leak detection system shall be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.</P>
              <P>(3) The bag leak detection system sensor shall provide an output of relative PM loadings.</P>
              <P>(4) The bag leak detection system shall be equipped with a device to continuously record the output signal from the sensor.</P>
              <P>(5) The bag leak detection system shall be equipped with an audible alarm system that will sound automatically when an increase in relative PM emissions over a preset level is detected. The alarm shall be located where it is easily heard by plant operating personnel.</P>
              <P>(6) For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak detector shall be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.</P>
              <P>(7) For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak detector shall be installed downstream of the fabric filter.</P>
              <P>(8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</P>
              <P>(9) The baseline output shall be established by adjusting the range and the averaging period of the device and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time according to section 5.0 of the “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance.”</P>
              <P>(10) Following initial adjustment of the system, the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time may not be adjusted. In no case may the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless such adjustment follows a complete fabric filter inspection that demonstrates that the fabric filter is in good operating condition. Each adjustment shall be recorded.</P>
              <P>(11) Record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.</P>

              <P>(12) Initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection system alarm; operate and maintain the fabric filter such that the alarm is not engaged for more than 5 percent of the total operating time in a 6-month block reporting period. If inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm is counted as a minimum of 1 hour. If it takes longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm time is counted as the <PRTPAGE P="323"/>actual amount of time taken to initiate corrective action.</P>

              <P>As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Portland cement plant</E> means any facility manufacturing portland cement by either the wet or dry process.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Bypass</E> means any system that prevents all or a portion of the kiln or clinker cooler exhaust gases from entering the main control device and ducts the gases through a separate control device. This does not include emergency systems designed to duct exhaust gases directly to the atmosphere in the event of a malfunction of any control device controlling kiln or clinker cooler emissions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Bypass stack</E> means the stack that vents exhaust gases to the atmosphere from the bypass control device.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Monovent</E> means an exhaust configuration of a building or emission control device (e.g., positive-pressure fabric filter) that extends the length of the structure and has a width very small in relation to its length (i.e., length to width ratio is typically greater than 5:1). The exhaust may be an open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a combination of such features.<PRTPAGE P="329"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Excess emissions</E> means, with respect to this subpart, results of any required measurements outside the applicable range (e.g., emissions limitations, parametric operating limits) that is permitted by this subpart. The values of measurements will be in the same units and averaging time as the values specified in this subpart for the limitations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Operating day</E> means a 24-hour period beginning at 12:00 midnight during which the kiln produces clinker at any time. For calculating 30 day rolling average emissions, an <E T="03">operating day</E> does not include the hours of operation during startup or shutdown.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Rolling average</E> means the weighted average of all data, meeting QA/QC requirements or otherwise normalized, collected during the applicable averaging period. The period of a rolling average stipulates the frequency of data averaging and reporting. To demonstrate compliance with an operating parameter a 30-day rolling average period requires calculation of a new average value each operating day and shall include the average of all the hourly averages of the specific operating parameter. For demonstration of compliance with an emissions limit based on pollutant concentration, a 30-day rolling average is comprised of the average of all the hourly average concentrations over the previous 30 operating days. For demonstration of compliance with an emissions limit based on lbs-pollutant per production unit, the 30-day rolling average is calculated by summing the hourly mass emissions over the previous 30 operating days, then dividing that sum by the total production during the same period.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Run average</E> means the average of the recorded parameter values for a run.</P>

              <P>(2) If the kiln and clinker cooler exhaust are combined for energy efficiency purposes and sent to a single control device, the appropriate kiln PM limit may be adjusted using the procedures in § 63.1343(b) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) If the kiln has a separated alkali bypass stack and/or an inline coal mill with a separate stack, you must combine the PM emissions from the bypass stack and/or the inline coal mill stack with the PM emissions from the main kiln exhaust to determine total PM emissions.</P>
              <P>(c) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, you may not discharge into the atmosphere from any affected facility other than the kiln and clinker cooler any gases which exhibit 10 percent opacity, or greater.</P>
              <P>(d) If you have an affected source subject to this subpart with a different emissions limit or requirement for the same pollutant under another regulation in title 40 of this chapter, once you are in compliance with the most stringent emissions limit or requirement, you are not subject to the less stringent requirement. Until you are in compliance with the more stringent limit, the less stringent limit continues to apply.</P>
              <P>(e) The compliance date for all revised monitoring and recordkeeping requirements contained in this rule will be the same as listed in 63.1351(c) unless you commenced construction as of June 16, 2008, at which time the compliance date is November 8, 2010 or upon startup, whichever is later.</P>

              <P>(1) Determine hourly clinker production by one of two methods:</P>
              <P>(i) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates of the amount of clinker produced in tons of mass per hour. The system of measuring hourly clinker production must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy or</P>
              <P>(ii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates of the amount of feed to the kiln in tons of mass per hour. The system of measuring feed must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy. Calculate your hourly clinker production rate using a kiln specific feed-to-clinker ratio based on reconciled clinker production rates determined for accounting purposes and recorded feed rates. This ratio should be updated monthly. Note that if this ratio changes at clinker reconciliation, you must use the new ratio going forward, but you do not have to retroactively change clinker production rates previously estimated.</P>
              <P>(iii) For each kiln operating hour for which you do not have data on clinker production or the amount of feed to the kiln, use the value from the most recent previous hour for which valid data are available.</P>

              <P>(2) Determine, record, and maintain a record of the accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production rates or feed rates before initial use (for new sources) or by the effective compliance date of this rule (for existing sources). During each quarter of source operation, you must determine, record, and maintain a record of the <PRTPAGE P="331"/>ongoing accuracy of the system of measuring hourly clinker production rates or feed rates.</P>
              <P>(3) If you measure clinker production directly, record the daily clinker production rates; if you measure the kiln feed rates and calculate clinker production, record the daily kiln feed and clinker production rates.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PM Emissions Monitoring Requirements.</E> (1) For each kiln or clinker cooler subject to a PM emissions limit in §§ 60.62(a)1(ii) and 60.62(a)1(iii) or §§ 60.62(b)(1)(i) and 60.62(b)(1)(ii), you must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test. You will conduct your performance test using Method 5 or Method 5I at appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter. You must also monitor continuous performance through use of a PM CPMS.</P>
              <P>(2) For your PM CPMS, you will establish a site-specific operating limit. If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit equivalent to 75 percent of the standard. If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test demonstrating compliance with the PM limit to establish your operating limit. You will use the PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous compliance with your operating limit. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.</P>
              <P>(i) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp or digital signal output and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps or the monitors digital equivalent.</P>
              <P>(ii) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit.</P>

              <P>(iii) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp or digital output values from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding 2-hour Method 5I test runs).</P>
              <P>(3) Determine your operating limit as specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (c)(5) of this section. If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit, you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp or digital equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit, you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test to establish your operating limit. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test. You must repeat the performance test at least annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.</P>
              <P>(4) If the average of your three Method 5 or 5I compliance test runs are below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or 5I compliance test with the procedures in (c)(4)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) Determine your PM CPMS instrument zero output with one of the following procedures.<PRTPAGE P="332"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.</P>
              <P>(B) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.</P>
              <P>(C) The zero point can also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept.</P>
              <P>(D) If none of the steps in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (C) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps or digital equivalent and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 1.</P>

For each performance test, conduct at least three separate runs each while the mill is on and the mill is off under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating at the level reasonably expected to occur. Conduct each test run to collect a minimum sample volume of 2 dscm for determining compliance with a new source limit and 1 dscm for determining compliance with an existing source limit. Calculate the time weighted average of the results from three consecutive runs to determine compliance. You need not determine the particulate matter collected in the impingers (“back half”) of the Method 5 or Method 5I particulate sampling train to demonstrate compliance with the PM standards of this subpart. This shall not preclude the permitting authority from requiring a determination of the “back half” for other purposes.</P>

              <P>(8) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (<E T="03">e.g.</E> beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp or digital signal value equivalent to the instrument zero output, <PRTPAGE P="334"/>technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp or digital equivalent signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.</P>

              <P>(d) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a CEMS continuously monitoring and recording the concentration by volume of NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions into the atmosphere for any kiln subject to the NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limit in § 60.62(a)(3). If the kiln has an alkali bypass, NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions from the alkali bypass do not need to be monitored, and NO<E T="52">X</E> emission monitoring of the kiln exhaust may be done upstream of any commingled alkali bypass gases.</P>

              <P>(e) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain a CEMS for continuously monitoring and recording the concentration by volume of SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions into the atmosphere for any kiln subject to the SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limit in § 60.62(a)(4). If you are complying with the alternative 90 percent SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions reduction emissions limit, you must also continuously monitor and record the concentration by volume of SO<E T="52">2</E> present at the wet scrubber inlet.</P>
              <P>(f) The NO<E T="52">X</E> and SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS required under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section must be installed, operated and maintained according to Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part and the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The span value of each NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMS monitor must be set at 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential NO<E T="52">X</E> emission concentration that translates to the applicable emissions limit at full clinker production capacity.</P>

              <P>(2) You must conduct performance evaluations of each NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMS monitor according to the requirements in § 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part. You must use Methods 7, 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E of appendix A-4 to this part for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to Method 7 or 7C of appendix A-4 to this part.</P>
              <P>(3) The span value for the SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS monitor is the SO<E T="52">2</E> emission concentration that corresponds to 125 percent of the applicable emissions limit at full clinker production capacity and the expected maximum fuel sulfur content.</P>

              <P>(4) You must conduct performance evaluations of each SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS monitor according to the requirements in § 60.13(c) and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B to this part. You must use Methods 6, 6A, or 6C of appendix A-4 to this part for conducting the relative accuracy evaluations. The method ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to Method 6 or 6A of appendix A-4 to this part.</P>

              <P>(5) You must comply with the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of appendix F to this part for each NO<E T="52">X</E> and SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS, including quarterly accuracy determinations for monitors, and daily calibration drift tests.</P>
              <P>(g) For each CPMS or CEMS required under paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected source is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).</P>
              <P>(2) You may not use data recorded during the monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. An owner or operator must use all the data collected during all other periods in reporting emissions or operating levels.</P>

              <P>(3) You must meet the requirements of § 60.13(h) when determining the 1-hour averages of emissions data.<PRTPAGE P="335"/>
              </P>

              <P>(h) You must install, operate, calibrate, and maintain instruments for continuously measuring and recording the stack gas flow rate to allow determination of the pollutant mass emissions rate to the atmosphere for each kiln subject to the PM emissions limits in § 60.62(a)(1)(ii) and (iii) and (b)(1)(i) and (ii), the NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limit in § 60.62(a)(3), or the SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limit in § 60.62(a)(4) according to the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1) through (10), where appropriate, of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) The owner or operator must install each sensor of the flow rate monitoring system in a location that provides representative measurement of the exhaust gas flow rate at the sampling location of the NO<E T="52">X</E> and/or SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS, taking into account the manufacturer's recommendations. The flow rate sensor is that portion of the system that senses the volumetric flow rate and generates an output proportional to that flow rate.</P>
              <P>(2) The flow rate monitoring system must be designed to measure the exhaust gas flow rate over a range that extends from a value of at least 20 percent less than the lowest expected exhaust flow rate to a value of at least 20 percent greater than the highest expected exhaust gas flow rate.</P>
              <P>(3) The flow rate monitoring system must have a minimum accuracy of 5 percent of the flow rate.</P>
              <P>(4) The flow rate monitoring system must be equipped with a data acquisition and recording system that is capable of recording values over the entire range specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The signal conditioner, wiring, power supply, and data acquisition and recording system for the flow rate monitoring system must be compatible with the output signal of the flow rate sensors used in the monitoring system.</P>
              <P>(6) The flow rate monitoring system must be designed to measure a minimum of one cycle of operational flow for each successive 15-minute period.</P>
              <P>(7) The flow rate sensor must be able to determine the daily zero and upscale calibration drift (CD) (see sections 3.1 and 8.3 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part for a discussion of CD).</P>
              <P>(i) Conduct the CD tests at two reference signal levels, zero (e.g., 0 to 20 percent of span) and upscale (e.g., 50 to 70 percent of span).</P>
              <P>(ii) The absolute value of the difference between the flow monitor response and the reference signal must be equal to or less than 3 percent of the flow monitor span.</P>
              <P>(8) You must perform an initial relative accuracy test of the flow rate monitoring system according to section 8.2 of Performance Specification 6 of appendix B to this part, with the exceptions noted in paragraphs (h)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The relative accuracy test is to evaluate the flow rate monitoring system alone rather than a continuous emission rate monitoring system.</P>
              <P>(ii) The relative accuracy of the flow rate monitoring system shall be no greater than 10 percent of the mean value of the reference method data.</P>
              <P>(9) You must verify the accuracy of the flow rate monitoring system at least once per year by repeating the relative accuracy test specified in paragraph (h)(8) of this section.</P>
              <P>(10) You must operate the flow rate monitoring system and record data during all periods of operation of the affected facility including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Development and Submittal (Upon Request) of Monitoring Plans.</E> To demonstrate compliance with any applicable emissions limit through performance stack testing or other emissions monitoring (including PM CPMS), you must develop a site-specific monitoring plan according to the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) through (4) of this section. This requirement also applies to you if you petition the EPA Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters under § 60.13(3)(i). If you use a bag leak detector system (BLDS), you must also meet the requirements specified in paragraph § 63.1350(m)(10) of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="336"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) For each continuous monitoring system (CMS) required in this section, you must develop, and submit to the permitting authority for approval upon request, a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. You must submit this site-specific monitoring plan, if requested, at least 30 days before the initial performance evaluation of your CMS.</P>
              <P>(i) Installation of the CMS sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control device);</P>
              <P>(ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction systems; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emissions testing and monitoring.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General emissions monitoring requirements.</E> You must install and operate a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration (ppmv) continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS). You must also install and operate a stack gas flow rate monitoring system. With measurements of stack gas NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration and stack gas flow rate, you will determine hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions rate (e.g., lb/hr) and with measured data of the hourly nitric acid production (tons), calculate emissions in units of the applicable emissions limit (lb/ton of 100 percent acid produced). You must operate the monitoring system and report emissions during all operating periods including unit startup and shutdown, and malfunction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nitrogen oxides concentration continuous emissions monitoring system.</E> (1) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring and recording the concentration of NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions in accordance with the provisions of § 60.13 and Performance Specification 2 of appendix B and Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part. You must use cylinder gas audits to fulfill the quarterly auditing requirement at section 5.1 of Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part for the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration CEMS.</P>
              <P>(2) For the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration CEMS, use a span value, as defined in Performance Specification 2, section 3.11, of appendix B of this part, of 500 ppmv (as NO<E T="52">2</E>). If you emit NO<E T="52">X</E> at concentrations higher than 600 ppmv (e.g., during startup or shutdown periods), you must apply a second CEMS or dual range CEMS and a second span value equal to <PRTPAGE P="341"/>125 percent of the maximum estimated NO<E T="52">X</E> emission concentration to apply to the second CEMS or to the higher of the dual analyzer ranges during such periods.</P>
              <P>(3) For conducting the relative accuracy test audits, per Performance Specification 2, section 8.4, of appendix B of this part and Procedure 1, section 5.1.1, of appendix F of this part, use either EPA Reference Method 7, 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E of appendix A-4 of this part; EPA Reference Method 320 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter; or ASTM D6348-03 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). To verify the operation of the second CEMS or the higher range of a dual analyzer CEMS described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you need not conduct a relative accuracy test audit but only the calibration drift test initially (found in Performance Specification 2, section 8.3.1, of appendix B of this part) and the cylinder gas audit thereafter (found in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2, of appendix F of this part).</P>

              <P>(4) If you use EPA Reference Method 7E of appendix A-4 of this part, you must mitigate loss of NO<E T="52">2</E> in water according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section and verify performance by conducting the system bias checks required in EPA Reference Method 7E, section 8, of appendix A-4 of this part according to (b)(4)(iv) of this section, or follow the dynamic spike procedure according to paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For a wet-basis measurement system, you must measure and report temperature of sample line and components (up to analyzer inlet) to demonstrate that the temperatures remain above the sample gas dew point at all times during the sampling.</P>
              <P>(ii) You may use a dilution probe to reduce the dew point of the sample gas.</P>
              <P>(iii) You may use a refrigerated-type condenser or similar device (e.g., permeation dryer) to remove condensate continuously from sample gas while maintaining minimal contact between condensate and sample gas.</P>

              <P>(iv) If your analyzer measures nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<E T="52">2</E>) separately, you must use both NO and NO<E T="52">2</E> calibration gases. Otherwise, you must substitute NO<E T="52">2</E> calibration gas for NO calibration gas in the performance of system bias checks.</P>

              <P>(v) You must conduct dynamic spiking according to EPA Reference Method 7E, section 16.1, of appendix A-4 of this part using NO<E T="52">2</E> as the spike gas.</P>
              <P>(5) Instead of a NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration CEMS meeting Performance Specification 2, you may apply an FTIR CEMS meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 15 of appendix B of this part to measure NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations. Should you use an FTIR CEMS, you must replace the Relative Accuracy Test Audit requirements of Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part with the validation requirements and criteria of Performance Specification 15, sections 11.1.1 and 12.0, of appendix B of this part.</P>

                <E T="54">X</E>
                <E T="03">mass emissions rate values.</E> You must use the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration CEMS, acid production, gas flow rate monitor and other monitoring data to calculate emissions data in units of the applicable limit (lb NO<E T="52">X</E>/ton of acid produced expressed as 100 percent nitric acid).</P>

              <P>(1) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring and recording the stack gas flow rates to use in combination with data from the CEMS for measuring emissions concentrations of NO<E T="52">X</E> to produce data in units of mass rate (e.g., lb/hr) of NO<E T="52">X</E> on an hourly basis. You will operate and certify the continuous emissions rate monitoring system (CERMS) in accordance with the provisions of § 60.13 and Performance Specification 6 of appendix B of this part. You must comply with the following provisions in (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) You must use a stack gas flow rate sensor with a full scale output of at least 125 percent of the maximum expected exhaust volumetric flow rate (see Performance Specification 6, section 8, of appendix B of this part).</P>

              <P>(ii) For conducting the relative accuracy test audits, per Performance Specification 6, section 8.2 of appendix B of this part and Procedure 1, section 5.1.1, of appendix F of this part, you must use either EPA Reference Method 2, 2F, or 2G of appendix A-4 of this part. You may also apply Method 2H in conjunction with other velocity measurements.<PRTPAGE P="342"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) You must verify that the CERMS complies with the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of appendix F of this part. You must conduct relative accuracy testing to provide for calculating the relative accuracy for RATA and RAA determinations in units of lb/hour.</P>
              <P>(2) You must determine the nitric acid production parameters (production rate and concentration) by installing, calibrating, maintaining, and operating a permanent monitoring system (e.g., weigh scale, volume flow meter, mass flow meter, tank volume) to measure and record the weight rates of nitric acid produced in tons per hour. If your nitric acid production rate measurements are for periods longer than hourly (e.g., daily values), you will determine average hourly production values, tons acid/hr, by dividing the total acid production by the number of hours of process operation for the subject measurement period. You must comply with the following provisions in (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) You must verify that each component of the monitoring system has an accuracy and precision of no more than ±5 percent of full scale.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must analyze product concentration via titration or by determining the temperature and specific gravity of the nitric acid. You may also use ASTM E1584-11 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), for determining the concentration of nitric acid in percent. You must determine product concentration daily.</P>
              <P>(iii) You must use the acid concentration to express the nitric acid production as 100 percent nitric acid.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must record the nitric acid production, expressed as 100 percent nitric acid, and the hours of operation.</P>
              <P>(3) You must calculate hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions rates in units of the standard (lb/ton acid) for each hour of process operation. For process operating periods for which there is little or no acid production (e.g., startup or shutdown), you must use the average hourly acid production rate determined from the data collected over the previous 30 days of normal acid production periods (see § 60.75a).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuous monitoring system.</E> For each continuous monitoring system, including NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration measurement, volumetric flow rate measurement, and nitric acid production measurement equipment, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected facility is operating except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods as defined in appendix F, sections 4 and 5, of this part, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments.</P>
              <P>(2) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or out-of-control periods, or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating emissions and the status of compliance with the applicable emissions limit in accordance with § 60.72a(a).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Initial performance testing.</E> You must conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions limit under § 60.72a(a) beginning in the calendar month following initial certification of the NO<E T="52">X</E> and flow rate monitoring CEMS. The initial performance test consists of collection of hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> average concentration, mass flow rate recorded with the certified NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration and flow rate CEMS and the corresponding acid generation (tons) data for all of the hours of operation for the first 30 days beginning on the first day of the first month following completion of the CEMS installation and certification as described above. You must assure that the CERMS meets all of the data quality assurance requirements as per § 60.13 and appendix F, Procedure 1, of this part and you must use the data from the CERMS for this compliance determination.</P>

              <P>(a) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of sulfur dioxide shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the owner or operator. The pollutant gas used to prepare calibration gas mixtures under Performance Specification 2 and for calibration checks under § 60.13(d), shall be sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>). Method 8 shall be used for conducting monitoring system performance evaluations under § 60.13(c) except that only the sulfur dioxide portion of the Method 8 results shall be used. The span value shall be set at 1000 ppm of sulfur dioxide.</P>

              <P>(b) The owner or operator shall establish a conversion factor for the purpose of converting monitoring data into units of the applicable standard (kg/metric ton, lb/ton). The conversion factor shall be determined, as a minimum, three times daily by measuring the concentration of sulfur dioxide entering the converter using suitable methods (e.g., the Reich test, National Air Pollution Control Administration Publication No. 999-AP-13) and calculating the appropriate conversion factor for each eight-hour period as follows:

This procedure is not required, but is an alternative that would alleviate problems encountered in the measurement of gas velocities or production rate. Continuous emission monitoring systems for measuring SO<E T="52">2</E>, O<E T="52">2</E>, and CO<E T="52">2</E> (if required) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the owner or operator and subjected to the certification procedures in Performance Specifications 2 and 3. The calibration procedure and span value for the SO<E T="52">2</E> monitor shall be as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The span value for CO<E T="52">2</E> (if required) shall be 10 percent and for O<E T="52">2</E> shall be 20.9 percent (air). A conversion factor based on process rate data is not necessary.

The span of this continuous monitoring system shall be set at 10 percent.</P>

A fuel gas stream that is determined to be low-sulfur is exempt from the monitoring requirements in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section until there are changes in operating conditions or stream composition.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a written application for an exemption from monitoring. The application must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the fuel gas stream/system to be considered, including submission of a portion of the appropriate piping diagrams indicating the boundaries of the fuel gas stream/system, and the affected fuel gas combustion device(s) to be considered;</P>

              <P>(ii) A statement that there are no crossover or entry points for sour gas (high H<E T="52">2</E>S content) to be introduced into the fuel gas stream/system (this should be shown in the piping diagrams);</P>
              <P>(iii) An explanation of the conditions that ensure low amounts of sulfur in the fuel gas stream (i.e., control equipment or product specifications) at all times;</P>

              <P>(iv) The supporting test results from sampling the requested fuel gas stream/system demonstrating that the sulfur content is less than 5 ppmv. Sampling data must include, at minimum, 2 weeks of daily monitoring (14 grab samples) for frequently operated fuel gas streams/systems; for infrequently operated fuel gas streams/systems, seven grab samples must be collected unless other additional information would support reduced sampling. The owner or operator shall use detector tubes (“length-of-stain tube” type measurement) following the “Gas Processors Association Standard 2377-86 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17), using tubes with a maximum span between 10 and 40 ppmv inclusive when 1≤N≤10, where N = number of pump strokes, to test the applicant fuel gas stream for H<E T="52">2</E>S; and</P>

              <P>(v) A description of how the 2 weeks (or seven samples for infrequently operated fuel gas streams/systems) of monitoring results compares to the typical range of H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration (fuel quality) expected for the fuel gas stream/system going to the affected fuel gas combustion device (e.g., the 2 weeks of daily detector tube results for a frequently operated loading rack included the entire range of products loaded out, and, therefore, should be representative of typical operating conditions affecting H<E T="52">2</E>S content in the fuel gas stream going to the loading rack flare).</P>
              <P>(2) The effective date of the exemption is the date of submission of the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section).</P>

              <P>(3) No further action is required unless refinery operating conditions change in such a way that affects the exempt fuel gas stream/system (e.g., <PRTPAGE P="355"/>the stream composition changes). If such a change occurs, the owner or operator will follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is still within the range of concentrations included in the original application, the owner or operator shall conduct an H<E T="52">2</E>S test on a grab sample and record the results as proof that the concentration is still within the range.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is outside the range of concentrations included in the original application, the owner or operator may submit new information following the procedures of paragraph (b)(1) of this section within 60 days (or within 30 days after the seventh grab sample is tested for infrequently operated process units).</P>

              <P>(iii) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is outside the range of concentrations included in the original application and the owner or operator chooses not to submit new information to support an exemption, the owner or operator must begin H<E T="52">2</E>S monitoring using daily stain sampling to demonstrate compliance using length-of stain tubes with a maximum span between 200 and 400 ppmv inclusive when 1≤N≤5, where N = number of pump strokes. The owner or operator must begin monitoring according to the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section as soon as practicable but in no case later than 180 days after the operation change. During daily stain tube sampling, a daily sample exceeding 162 ppmv is an exceedance of the 3-hour H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration limit.</P>
              <P>(c) The average coke burn-off rate (Mg (tons) per hour) and hours of operation shall be recorded daily for any fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator subject to § 60.102, § 60.103, or § 60.104(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(d) For any fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator under § 60.102 that uses an incinerator-waste heat boiler to combust the exhaust gases from the catalyst regenerator, the owner or operator shall record daily the rate of combustion of liquid or solid fossil-fuels and the hours of operation during which liquid or solid fossil-fuels are combusted in the incinerator-waste heat boiler.</P>

              <P>(e)(1) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the H<E T="52">2</E>S standard in § 60.104(a)(1) as follows: Method 11, 15, 15A, or 16 shall be used to determine the H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration. The gases entering the sampling train should be at about atmospheric pressure.

              <P>(i) For Method 11, the sampling time and sample volume shall be at least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf). Two samples of equal sampling times shall be taken at about 1-hour intervals. The arithmetic average of these two samples shall constitute a run. For most fuel gases, sampling times exceeding 20 minutes may result in depletion of the collection solution, although fuel gases containing low concentrations of H<E T="52">2</E>S may necessitate sampling for longer periods of time.</P>
              <P>(ii) For Method 15 or 16, at least three injects over a 1-hour period shall constitute a run.</P>

The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 6. A 1-hour sample shall constitute a run. Method 6 samples shall be taken at a rate of approximately 2 liters/min. The ppm correction factor (Method 6) and the sampling location in paragraph (f)(1) of this section apply. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C.</P>

              <P>(f) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the SO<E T="52">2</E> and the H<E T="52">2</E>S and reduced sulfur standards in § 60.104(a)(2) as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration. The concentration in mg/dscm obtained by Method 6 or 6C is multiplied by 0.3754 to obtain the concentration in ppm. The sampling point in the duct shall be the centroid of the cross section if the cross-sectional area is less than 5.00 m<SU>2</SU> (53.8 ft<SU>2</SU>) or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.00 m (39.4 in.) if the cross-sectional area is 5.00 m<SU>2</SU> or more and the centroid is more than 1 m from the wall. The sampling time and sample volume shall be at least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf) for each sample. Eight samples of equal sampling times shall be taken at about 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average of these eight samples shall constitute a run. For Method 6C, a run shall consist of the arithmetic average of four 1-hour samples. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal to the time it takes for two Method 6 samples. The moisture content from this sample shall be used to correct the corresponding Method 6 samples for moisture. For documenting the oxidation efficiency of the control device for reduced sulfur compounds, Method 15 shall be used following the procedures of paragraph (f)(2) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="358"/>
              </P>

              <P>(2) Method 15 shall be used to determine the reduced sulfur and H<E T="52">2</E> S concentrations. Each run shall consist of 16 samples taken over a minimum of 3 hours. The sampling point shall be the same as that described for Method 6 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. To ensure minimum residence time for the sample inside the sample lines, the sampling rate shall be at least 3.0 lpm (0.10 cfm). The SO<E T="52">2</E> equivalent for each run shall be calculated after being corrected for moisture and oxygen as the arithmetic average of the SO<E T="52">2</E> equivalent for each sample during the run. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the gases as the paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal to the time it takes for four Method 15 samples.</P>

              <P>(3) The oxygen concentration used to correct the emission rate for excess air shall be obtained by the integrated sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3 or 3A.

The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60. The owner or operator may demonstrate compliance based on the mixture used in the fuel gas combustion device or flare or for each individual fuel gas stream used in the fuel gas combustion device or flare.</P>

              <P>(i) For Method 11 of appendix A-5 to part 60, the sampling time and sample volume must be at least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf). Two samples of equal sampling times must be taken at about 1-hour intervals. The arithmetic average of these two samples constitutes a run. For most fuel gases, sampling times exceeding 20 minutes may result in depletion of the collection solution, although fuel gases containing low concentrations of H<E T="52">2</E>S may necessitate sampling for longer periods of time.</P>

              <P>(ii) For Method 15 of appendix A-5 to part 60, at least three injects over a 1-hour period constitutes a run.<PRTPAGE P="384"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) For Method 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60, a 1-hour sample constitutes a run. The method ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,” (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 15A of appendix A-5 to part 60.</P>
              <P>(iv) If monitoring is conducted at a single point in a common source of fuel gas as allowed under § 60.107a(a)(2)(iv), only one performance test is required. That is, performance tests are not required when a new affected fuel gas combustion device or flare is added to a common source of fuel gas that previously demonstrated compliance.</P>

              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator a written application for an exemption from monitoring. The application must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) A description of the fuel gas stream/system to be considered, including submission of a portion of the appropriate piping diagrams indicating the boundaries of the fuel gas stream/system and the affected fuel gas combustion device(s) or flare(s) to be considered;</P>

              <P>(ii) A statement that there are no crossover or entry points for sour gas (high H<E T="52">2</E>S content) to be introduced into the fuel gas stream/system (this should be shown in the piping diagrams);</P>
              <P>(iii) An explanation of the conditions that ensure low amounts of sulfur in the fuel gas stream (i.e., control equipment or product specifications) at all times;</P>

              <P>(iv) The supporting test results from sampling the requested fuel gas stream/system demonstrating that the sulfur content is less than 5 ppmv H<E T="52">2</E>S. Sampling data must include, at minimum, 2 weeks of daily monitoring (14 grab samples) for frequently operated fuel gas streams/systems; for infrequently operated fuel gas streams/systems, seven grab samples must be collected unless other additional information would support reduced sampling. The owner or operator shall use detector tubes (“length-of-stain tube” type measurement) following the “Gas Processors Association Standard 2377-86 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17), using tubes with a maximum span between 10 and 40 ppmv inclusive when 1≤N≤10, where N = number of pump strokes, to test the applicant fuel gas stream for H<E T="52">2</E>S; and</P>

              <P>(v) A description of how the 2 weeks (or seven samples for infrequently operated fuel gas streams/systems) of monitoring results compares to the typical range of H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration <PRTPAGE P="398"/>(fuel quality) expected for the fuel gas stream/system going to the affected fuel gas combustion device or flare (e.g., the 2 weeks of daily detector tube results for a frequently operated loading rack included the entire range of products loaded out and, therefore, should be representative of typical operating conditions affecting H<E T="52">2</E>S content in the fuel gas stream going to the loading rack flare).</P>
              <P>(2) The effective date of the exemption is the date of submission of the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) No further action is required unless refinery operating conditions change in such a way that affects the exempt fuel gas stream/system (e.g., the stream composition changes). If such a change occurs, the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is still within the range of concentrations included in the original application, the owner or operator shall conduct an H<E T="52">2</E>S test on a grab sample and record the results as proof that the concentration is still within the range.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is outside the range of concentrations included in the original application, the owner or operator may submit new information following the procedures of paragraph (b)(1) of this section within 60 days (or within 30 days after the seventh grab sample is tested for infrequently operated process units).</P>

              <P>(iii) If the operation change results in a sulfur content that is outside the range of concentrations included in the original application and the owner or operator chooses not to submit new information to support an exemption, the owner or operator must begin H<E T="52">2</E>S monitoring using daily stain sampling to demonstrate compliance using length-of-stain tubes with a maximum span between 200 and 400 ppmv inclusive when 1≤N≤5, where N = number of pump strokes. The owner or operator must begin monitoring according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section as soon as practicable, but in no case later than 180 days after the operation change. During daily stain tube sampling, a daily sample exceeding 162 ppmv is an exceedance of the 3-hour H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration limit. The owner or operator of a fuel gas combustion device must also determine a rolling 365-day average using the stain sampling results; an average H<E T="52">2</E>S concentration of 5 ppmv must be used for days within the rolling 365-day period prior to the operation change.</P>

              <P>(1) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service), prior to filling the storage vessel with VOL. If there are holes, tears, or other openings in the primary seal, the secondary seal, or the seal fabric or defects in the internal floating roof, or both, the owner or operator shall repair the items before filling the storage vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) For Vessels equipped with a liquid-mounted or mechanical shoe primary seal, visually inspect the internal floating roof and the primary seal or the secondary seal (if one is in service) through manholes and roof hatches on the fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial fill. If the internal floating roof is not resting on the surface of the VOL inside the storage vessel, or there is liquid accumulated on the roof, or the seal is detached, or there are holes or tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days. If a failure that is detected during inspections required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, a 30-day extension may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report required in § 60.115b(a)(3). Such a request for an extension must document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable and specify a schedule of actions the company will take that will assure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(3) For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in § 60.112b(a)(1)(ii)(B):</P>
              <P>(i) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section at least every 5 years; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes and sleeve seals (if any) each time the storage vessel is emptied and degassed. If the internal floating roof has defects, the primary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the gaskets no longer close off the liquid surfaces from the atmosphere, or the slotted membrane has more than 10 percent open area, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before refilling the storage vessel with VOL. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of vessels conducting the annual visual inspection as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section and at intervals no greater than 5 years in the case of vessels specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to the filling or refilling of each storage vessel for which an inspection is required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(4) of this section to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If the inspection required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance or refilling the tank, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, this notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling.</P>

              <P>(a) When determining compliance with mass and visible emission limits specified in § 60.142a(a) (2) and (3), the owner or operator of a BOPF shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping cycles may elect to operate only one furnace. If an owner or operator chooses to shut down one furnace, he shall be allowed a reasonable time period to adjust his production schedule before the compliance tests are conducted. The owner or operator of an affected facility may also elect to suspend shop operations not subject to this subpart during compliance testing.</P>
              <P>(b) During compliance testing for mass and visible emission standards, if an owner or operator elects to shut down one furnace in a shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping cycles, the owner or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system for the furnace being tested at exhaust ventilation rates or levels for each duct of the secondary emission control system that are appropriate for single-furnace operation. Following the compliance test, the owner or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system at exhaust ventilation rates or levels for each duct of the system that are no lower than 90 percent of the exhaust ventilation values established during the most recent compliance test.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of determining compliance with visible and mass emission standards, a steel production cycle begins when the scrap or hot metal is charged to the vessel (whichever operation occurs first) and terminates 3 minutes after slag is emptied from the vessel into the slag pot. Consecutive steel production cycles are not required for the purpose of determining compliance. Where a hot metal transfer or skimming station is an affected facility, the steel production cycle also includes the hot metal transfer or skimming operation for the next steel production cycle for the affected vessel. Visible emission observations for both hot metal transfer and skimming operations begin with the start of the operation and terminate 3 minutes after completion of the operation.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purpose of determining compliance with visible emission standards specified in § 60.142a(a) (1) and (3), the starting and stopping times of regulated process operations shall be determined and the starting and stopping times of visible emissions data sets shall be determined accordingly.</P>
              <P>(e) To determine compliance with § 60.142a(a)(1), select the data sets yielding the highest and second highest 3-minute average opacities for each steel production cycle. Compliance is achieved if the highest 3-minute average for each cycle observed is less than 20 percent and the second highest 3-minute average is 10 percent or less.</P>
              <P>(f) To determine compliance with § 60.142(a)(2), determine the concentration of particulate matter in exhaust gases exiting the secondary emission collection device with Method 5. Compliance is achieved if the concentration of particulate matter does not exceed 23 mg/dscm (0.010 gr/dscf).</P>
              <P>(g) To determine compliance with § 60.142a(a)(3), construct consecutive 3-minute averages for each steel production cycle. Compliance is achieved if no 3-minute average is more than 5 percent.</P>

              <P>(a) The owner or operator of any triple superphosphate plant subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow monitoring device that can be used to determine the mass flow of phosphorus-bearing feed material to the process. The flow monitoring device shall have an accuracy of ±5 percent over its operating range.</P>

              <P>(b) The owner or operator of any triple superphosphate plant shall maintain a daily record of equivalent P<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">5</E> feed by first determining the total mass rate in Mg/hr of phosphorus-bearing feed using a flow monitoring device meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and then by proceeding according to § 60.234(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(c) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner or operator of any triple superphosphate plant subject to the provisions of this part shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a monitoring device that continuously measures and permanently records the total pressure drop across the absorber. The monitoring device shall have an accuracy of ±5 percent over its operating range.</P>
              <P>(d) Any facility under § 60.230(a) that commences construction, modification, or reconstruction after November 7, 2014 is subject to the requirements of this paragraph instead of the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section. If an absorber is used to comply with § 60.232, then the owner or operator shall continuously monitor pressure drop through the absorber and meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system (CMS) that continuously measures and permanently records the pressure at the gas stream inlet and outlet of the absorber. The pressure at the gas stream inlet of the absorber may be measured using amperage on the blower if a correlation between pressure and amperage is established.</P>
              <P>(2) The CMS must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over the normal range measured or 0.12 kilopascals (0.5 inches of water column), whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator shall establish an allowable range for the pressure drop through the absorber. The allowable range is ±20 percent of the arithmetic average of the three test runs conducted during the performance test required in § 60.8. The Administrator retains the right to reduce the ±20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard. However, the adjustment must not be reduced to less than ±10 percent under any instance.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall demonstrate continuous compliance by maintaining the daily average pressure drop through the absorber to within the allowable range established in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The daily average pressure drop through the absorber for each operating day shall be calculated using the data recorded by the monitoring system. If the emissions unit operation is continuous, the operating day is a 24-hour period. If the emissions unit operation is not continuous, the operating day is the total number of hours of control device operation per 24-hour period. Valid data points must be available for 75 percent of the operating hours in an operating day to compute the daily average.</P>

              <P>(b) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to measure and continuously record the furnace power input. The furnace power input may be measured at the output or input side of the transformer. The device must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over its operating range.<PRTPAGE P="474"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously measures and records the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood of the capture system, except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section. The owner or operator of an electric submerged arc furnace that is equipped with a water cooled cover which is designed to contain and prevent escape of the generated gas and particulate matter shall monitor only the volumetric flow rate through the capture system for control of emissions from the tapping station. The owner or operator may install the monitoring device(s) in any appropriate location in the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will result. The flow rate monitoring device must have an accuracy of ±10 percent over its normal operating range and must be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring device relative to Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A to this part.</P>
              <P>(d) When performance tests are conducted under the provisions of § 60.8 of this part to demonstrate compliance with the standards under §§ 60.262(a) (4) and (5), the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood of the capture system must be determined using the monitoring device required under paragraph (c) of this section. The volumetric flow rates must be determined for furnace power input levels at 50 and 100 percent of the nominal rated capacity of the electric submerged arc furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc furnace is operated, the owner or operator shall maintain the volumetric flow rate at or above the appropriate levels for that furnace power input level determined during the most recent performance test. If emissions due to tapping are captured and ducted separately from emissions of the electric submerged arc furnace, during each tapping period the owner or operator shall maintain the exhaust flow rates through the capture system over the tapping station at or above the levels established during the most recent performance test. Operation at lower flow rates may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request that these flow rates be reestablished by conducting new performance tests under § 60.8 of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator may as an alternative to paragraph (c) of this section determine the volumetric flow rate through each fan of the capture system from the fan power consumption, pressure drop across the fan and the fan performance curve. Only data specific to the operation of the affected electric submerged arc furnace are acceptable for demonstration of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph. The owner or operator shall maintain on file a permanent record of the fan performance curve (prepared for a specific temperature) and shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to continuously measure and record the power consumption of the fan motor (measured in kilowatts), and</P>
              <P>(2) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to continuously measure and record the pressure drop across the fan. The fan power consumption and pressure drop measurements must be synchronized to allow real time comparisions of the data. The monitoring devices must have an accuracy of ±5 percent over their normal operating ranges.</P>

              <P>(f) The volumetric flow rate through each fan of the capture system must be determined from the fan power consumption, fan pressure drop, and fan performance curve specified under paragraph (e) of this section, during any performance test required under § 60.8 to demonstrate compliance with the standards under §§ 60.262(a)(4) and (5). The owner or operator shall determine the volumetric flow rate at a representative temperature for furnace power input levels of 50 and 100 percent of the nominal rated capacity of the electric submerged arc furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc furnace is operated, the owner or operator shall maintain the fan power consumption and fan pressure drop at levels such that the volumetric flow rate is at or above the levels established during <PRTPAGE P="475"/>the most recent performance test for that furnace power input level. If emissions due to tapping are captured and ducted separately from emissions of the electric submerged arc furnace, during each tapping period the owner or operator shall maintain the fan power consumption and fan pressure drop at levels such that the volumetric flow rate is at or above the levels established during the most recent performance test. Operation at lower flow rates may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request that these flow rates be reestablished by conducting new performance tests under § 60.8. The Administrator may require the owner or operator to verify the fan performance curve by monitoring necessary fan operating parameters and determining the gas volume moved relative to Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A to this part.</P>

              <P>(b) For the purpose of reports under § 60.7(c), all six-minute periods during which the average opacity is three percent or greater shall indicate a period of excess emission, and shall be reported to the Administrator semi-annually.</P>

              <P>(c) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s) is not required on any modular, multi-stack, negative-pressure or positive-pressure fabric filter if observations of the opacity of the visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible emission observer; or on any single-stack fabric filter if visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible emission observer and the owner installs and continuously operates a bag leak detection system according to paragraph (e) of this section. Visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once per day for at least three 6-minute periods when the furnace is operating in the melting and refining period. All visible emissions observations shall be conducted in accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to this part. If visible emissions occur from more than one point, the opacity shall be recorded for any points where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of <PRTPAGE P="478"/>the visible emission, only one set of three 6-minute observations will be required. In that case, the Method 9 observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average that is in excess of the emission limit specified in § 60.272(a).</P>
              <P>(d) A furnace static pressure monitoring device is not required on any EAF equipped with a DEC system if observations of shop opacity are performed by a certified visible emission observer as follows: Shop opacity observations shall be conducted at least once per day when the furnace is operating in the meltdown and refining period. Shop opacity shall be determined as the arithmetic average of 24 or more consecutive 15-second opacity observations of emissions from the shop taken in accordance with Method 9. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any point(s) where visible emissions are observed in proximity to an affected EAF. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of visible emissions, only one observation of shop opacity will be required. In this case, the shop opacity observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident.</P>
              <P>(e) A bag leak detection system must be installed and continuously operated on all single-stack fabric filters if the owner or operator elects not to install and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section. In addition, the owner or operator shall meet the visible emissions observation requirements in paragraph (c) of this section.

For each bag leak detection system that operates based on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan shall be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance” (EPA-454/R-98-015). The owner or operator shall operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. The plan shall describe:</P>
              <P>(i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;</P>
              <P>(ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection system including how the alarm set-point will be established;</P>
              <P>(iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality assurance procedures;</P>

              <P>(i) Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal effects including temperature and humidity according to the procedures identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required under paragraphs (e)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If opacities greater than zero percent are observed over four consecutive 15-second observations during the daily opacity observations required under paragraph (c) of this section and the alarm on the bag leak detection system does not sound, the owner or operator shall lower the alarm set point on the bag leak detection system to a point where the alarm would have sounded during the period when the opacity observations were made.</P>
              <P>(7) For negative pressure, induced air baghouses, and positive pressure baghouses that are discharged to the atmosphere through a stack, the bag leak detection sensor must be installed downstream of the baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.</P>
              <P>(8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</P>

Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, the cause of the alarm must be alleviated within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in particulate emissions;</P>

The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of these parameters whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon which the parameters were previously established are no longer applicable. The values of these parameters as determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at the appropriate level for each applicable period. Operation at other than baseline values may be subject to the requirements of § 60.276(a).</P>
              <P>(d) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to approve any alternative method that will provide a continuous record of operation of each emission capture system.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches).

The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of the 15-minute integrated average pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon which the pressures were previously established are no longer applicable. The pressure determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at all <PRTPAGE P="481"/>times the EAF is operating in a meltdown and refining period. Operation at higher pressures may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility.</P>

              <P>(d) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the total capture system (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches). This inspection shall include observations of the physical appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in ductwork, and fan erosion). Any deficiencies shall be noted and proper maintenance performed.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to approve any alternative to either the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section or the monthly operational status inspections specified in paragraph (d) of this section if the alternative will provide a continuous record of operation of each emission capture system.</P>

The pressure shall be recorded as 15-minute integrated averages. The monitoring device may be installed in any appropriate location in the EAF or DEC duct prior to the introduction of ambient air such that reproducible results will be obtained. The pressure monitoring device shall have an accuracy of ±5 mm of water gauge over its normal operating range and shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions.</P>

The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of the pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon which the pressures were previously established are no longer applicable. The pressure determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at all times when the EAF is operating in a meltdown and refining period. Operation at higher pressures may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility.</P>
              <P>(h) During any performance test required under § 60.8, and for any report thereof required by § 60.276a(f) of this subpart, or to determine compliance with § 60.272a(a)(3) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor the following information for all heats covered by the test:</P>

The affirmative defense must not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Assertion of affirmative defense.</E> To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, you must timely meet the reporting requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</P>
              <P>(1) The violation:</P>
              <P>(i) Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and</P>
              <P>(2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation occurred; and</P>
              <P>(3) The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and</P>
              <P>(4) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and</P>
              <P>(5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and</P>
              <P>(6) All emission monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and</P>

              <P>(7) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and<PRTPAGE P="506"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</P>
              <P>(9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis must also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the result of the malfunction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Report.</E> The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense must submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation that explains how it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. This affirmative defense report must be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner or operator of any stationary gas turbine subject to the provisions of this subpart and using water or steam injection to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous monitoring system to monitor and record the fuel consumption and the ratio of water or steam to fuel being fired in the turbine.</P>

              <P>(b) The owner or operator of any stationary gas turbine that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification after October 3, 1977, but before July 8, 2004, and which uses water or steam injection to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions may, as an alternative to operating the continuous monitoring system described in paragraph (a) of this section, install, certify, maintain, operate, and quality-assure a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) consisting of NO<E T="52">X</E> and O<E T="52">2</E> monitors. As an alternative, a CO<E T="52">2</E> monitor may be used to adjust the measured NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations to 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E> by either converting the CO<E T="52">2</E> hourly averages to equivalent O<E T="52">2</E> concentrations using Equation F-14a or F-14b in appendix F to part 75 of this chapter and making the adjustments to 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E>, or by using the CO<E T="52">2</E> readings directly to make the adjustments, as described in Method 20. If the option to use a CEMS is chosen, the CEMS shall be installed, certified, maintained and operated as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Each CEMS must be installed and certified according to PS 2 and 3 (for diluent) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, except the 7-day calibration drift is based on unit operating days, not calendar days. Appendix F, Procedure 1 is not required. The relative accuracy test audit (RATA) of the NO<E T="52">X</E> and diluent monitors may be performed individually or on a combined basis, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the relative accuracy tests of the CEMS may be performed either:</P>
              <P>(i) On a ppm basis (for NO<E T="52">X</E>) and a percent O<E T="52">2</E> basis for oxygen; or</P>
              <P>(ii) On a ppm at 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E> basis; or</P>
              <P>(iii) On a ppm basis (for NO<E T="52">X</E>) and a percent CO<E T="52">2</E> basis (for a CO<E T="52">2</E> monitor that uses the procedures in Method 20 to correct the NO<E T="52">X</E> data to 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E>).</P>

              <P>(2) As specified in § 60.13(e)(2), during each full unit operating hour, each monitor must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute quadrant of the hour, to validate the hour. For partial unit operating hours, at least one valid data point must be obtained for each quadrant of the hour in which the unit operates. For unit operating hours in which required quality assurance and maintenance activities are performed on the CEMS, a minimum of two valid data <PRTPAGE P="524"/>points (one in each of two quadrants) are required to validate the hour.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of identifying excess emissions, CEMS data must be reduced to hourly averages as specified in § 60.13(h).</P>

              <P>(i) For each unit operating hour in which a valid hourly average, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is obtained for both NO<E T="52">X</E> and diluent, the data acquisition and handling system must calculate and record the hourly NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions in the units of the applicable NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standard under § 60.332(a), <E T="03">i.e.</E>, percent NO<E T="52">X</E> by volume, dry basis, corrected to 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E> and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard conditions (if required as given in § 60.335(b)(1)). For any hour in which the hourly average O<E T="52">2</E> concentration exceeds 19.0 percent O<E T="52">2</E>, a diluent cap value of 19.0 percent O<E T="52">2</E> may be used in the emission calculations.</P>

              <P>(ii) A worst case ISO correction factor may be calculated and applied using historical ambient data. For the purpose of this calculation, substitute the maximum humidity of ambient air (Ho), minimum ambient temperature (T<E T="52">a</E>), and minimum combustor inlet absolute pressure (P<E T="52">o</E>) into the ISO correction equation.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the owner or operator has installed a NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, and is continuing to meet the ongoing requirements of part 75 of this chapter, the CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, except that the missing data substitution methodology provided for at 40 CFR part 75, subpart D, is not required for purposes of identifying excess emissions. Instead, periods of missing CEMS data are to be reported as monitor downtime in the excess emissions and monitoring performance report required in § 60.7(c).</P>

              <P>(c) For any turbine that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification after October 3, 1977, but before July 8, 2004, and which does not use steam or water injection to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, the owner or operator may, but is not required to, for purposes of determining excess emissions, use a CEMS that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Also, if the owner or operator has previously submitted and received EPA, State, or local permitting authority approval of a procedure for monitoring compliance with the applicable NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit under § 60.332, that approved procedure may continue to be used.</P>

              <P>(d) The owner or operator of any new turbine constructed after July 8, 2004, and which uses water or steam injection to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions may elect to use either the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section for continuous water or steam to fuel ratio monitoring or may use a NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMS installed, certified, operated, maintained, and quality-assured as described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(e) The owner or operator of any new turbine that commences construction after July 8, 2004, and which does not use water or steam injection to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, may, but is not required to, elect to use a NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMS installed, certified, operated, maintained, and quality-assured as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Other acceptable monitoring approaches include periodic testing approved by EPA or the State or local permitting authority or continuous parameter monitoring as described in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(f) The owner or operator of a new turbine that commences construction after July 8, 2004, which does not use water or steam injection to control NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions may, but is not required to, perform continuous parameter monitoring as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) For a diffusion flame turbine without add-on selective catalytic reduction controls (SCR), the owner or operator shall define at least four parameters indicative of the unit's NO<E T="52">X</E> formation characteristics and shall monitor these parameters continuously.</P>

              <P>(2) For any lean premix stationary combustion turbine, the owner or operator shall continuously monitor the appropriate parameters to determine whether the unit is operating in low-NO<E T="52">X</E> mode.</P>
              <P>(3) For any turbine that uses SCR to reduce NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, the owner or operator shall continuously monitor appropriate parameters to verify the <PRTPAGE P="525"/>proper operation of the emission controls.</P>

              <P>(4) For affected units that are also regulated under part 75 of this chapter, if the owner or operator elects to monitor NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate using the methodology in appendix E to part 75 of this chapter, or the low mass emissions methodology in § 75.19 of this chapter, the requirements of this paragraph (f) may be met by performing the parametric monitoring described in section 2.3 of appendix E or in § 75.19(c)(1)(iv)(H) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(g) The steam or water to fuel ratio or other parameters that are continuously monitored as described in paragraphs (a), (d) or (f) of this section shall be monitored during the performance test required under § 60.8, to establish acceptable values and ranges. The owner or operator may supplement the performance test data with engineering analyses, design specifications, manufacturer's recommendations and other relevant information to define the acceptable parametric ranges more precisely. The owner or operator shall develop and keep on-site a parameter monitoring plan which explains the procedures used to document proper operation of the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls. The plan shall include the parameter(s) monitored and the acceptable range(s) of the parameter(s) as well as the basis for designating the parameter(s) and acceptable range(s). Any supplemental data such as engineering analyses, design specifications, manufacturer's recommendations and other relevant information shall be included in the monitoring plan. For affected units that are also subject to part 75 of this chapter and that use the low mass emissions methodology in § 75.19 of this chapter or the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission measurement methodology in appendix E to part 75, the owner or operator may meet the requirements of this paragraph by developing and keeping on-site (or at a central location for unmanned facilities) a quality-assurance plan, as described in § 75.19 (e)(5) or in section 2.3 of appendix E and section 1.3.6 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(h) The owner or operator of any stationary gas turbine subject to the provisions of this subpart:</P>
              <P>(1) Shall monitor the total sulfur content of the fuel being fired in the turbine, except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section. The sulfur content of the fuel must be determined using total sulfur methods described in § 60.335(b)(10). Alternatively, if the total sulfur content of the gaseous fuel during the most recent performance test was less than 0.4 weight percent (4000 ppmw), ASTM D4084-82, 94, D5504-01, D6228-98, or Gas Processors Association Standard 2377-86 (all of which are incorporated by reference-see § 60.17), which measure the major sulfur compounds may be used; and</P>

              <P>(2) Shall monitor the nitrogen content of the fuel combusted in the turbine, if the owner or operator claims an allowance for fuel bound nitrogen (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, if an F-value greater than zero is being or will be used by the owner or operator to calculate STD in § 60.332). The nitrogen content of the fuel shall be determined using methods described in § 60.335(b)(9) or an approved alternative.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the owner or operator may elect not to monitor the total sulfur content of the gaseous fuel combusted in the turbine, if the gaseous fuel is demonstrated to meet the definition of natural gas in § 60.331(u), regardless of whether an existing custom schedule approved by the administrator for subpart GG requires such monitoring. The owner or operator shall use one of the following sources of information to make the required demonstration:</P>
              <P>(i) The gas quality characteristics in a current, valid purchase contract, tariff sheet or transportation contract for the gaseous fuel, specifying that the maximum total sulfur content of the fuel is 20.0 grains/100 scf or less; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Representative fuel sampling data which show that the sulfur content of the gaseous fuel does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf. At a minimum, the amount of fuel sampling data specified in section 2.3.1.4 or 2.3.2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter is required.<PRTPAGE P="526"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) For any turbine that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification after October 3, 1977, but before July 8, 2004, and for which a custom fuel monitoring schedule has previously been approved, the owner or operator may, without submitting a special petition to the Administrator, continue monitoring on this schedule.</P>
              <P>(i) The frequency of determining the sulfur and nitrogen content of the fuel shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Fuel oil.</E> For fuel oil, use one of the total sulfur sampling options and the associated sampling frequency described in sections 2.2.3, 2.2.4.1, 2.2.4.2, and 2.2.4.3 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, flow proportional sampling, daily sampling, sampling from the unit's storage tank after each addition of fuel to the tank, or sampling each delivery prior to combining it with fuel oil already in the intended storage tank). If an emission allowance is being claimed for fuel-bound nitrogen, the nitrogen content of the oil shall be determined and recorded once per unit operating day.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Gaseous fuel.</E> Any applicable nitrogen content value of the gaseous fuel shall be determined and recorded once per unit operating day. For owners and operators that elect not to demonstrate sulfur content using options in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, and for which the fuel is supplied without intermediate bulk storage, the sulfur content value of the gaseous fuel shall be determined and recorded once per unit operating day.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Custom schedules.</E> Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i)(2) of this section, operators or fuel vendors may develop custom schedules for determination of the total sulfur content of gaseous fuels, based on the design and operation of the affected facility and the characteristics of the fuel supply. Except as provided in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) and (i)(3)(ii) of this section, custom schedules shall be substantiated with data and shall be approved by the Administrator before they can be used to comply with the standard in § 60.333.</P>
              <P>(i) The two custom sulfur monitoring schedules set forth in paragraphs (i)(3)(i)(A) through (D) and in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section are acceptable, without prior Administrative approval:</P>
              <P>(A) The owner or operator shall obtain daily total sulfur content measurements for 30 consecutive unit operating days, using the applicable methods specified in this subpart. Based on the results of the 30 daily samples, the required frequency for subsequent monitoring of the fuel's total sulfur content shall be as specified in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(B), (C), or (D) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(B) If none of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total sulfur content exceeds 0.4 weight percent (4000 ppmw), subsequent sulfur content monitoring may be performed at 12 month intervals. If any of the samples taken at 12-month intervals has a total sulfur content between 0.4 and 0.8 weight percent (4000 and 8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C) of this section. If any measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) If at least one of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total sulfur content is between 0.4 and 0.8 weight percent (4000 and 8000 ppmw), but none exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), then:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Collect and analyze a sample every 30 days for three months. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Otherwise, follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Begin monitoring at 6-month intervals for 12 months. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Otherwise, follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Begin monitoring at 12-month intervals. If any sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Otherwise, continue to monitor at this frequency.</P>

              <P>(D) If a sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), immediately begin daily monitoring <PRTPAGE P="527"/>according to paragraph (i)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Daily monitoring shall continue until 30 consecutive daily samples, each having a sulfur content no greater than 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), are obtained. At that point, the applicable procedures of paragraph (i)(3)(i)(B) or (C) of this section shall be followed.</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator may use the data collected from the 720-hour sulfur sampling demonstration described in section 2.3.6 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter to determine a custom sulfur sampling schedule, as follows:</P>

              <P>(A) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from the 720 hourly samples does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the maximum total sulfur content of natural gas as defined in § 60.331(u)), no additional monitoring of the sulfur content of the gas is required, for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(B) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from any of the 720 hourly samples exceeds 20 grains/100 scf, but none of the sulfur content values (when converted to weight percent sulfur) exceeds 0.4 weight percent (4000 ppmw), then the minimum required sampling frequency shall be one sample at 12 month intervals.</P>
              <P>(C) If any sample result exceeds 0.4 weight percent sulfur (4000 ppmw), but none exceeds 0.8 weight percent sulfur (8000 ppmw), follow the provisions of paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(D) If the sulfur content of any of the 720 hourly samples exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the provisions of paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(j) For each affected unit that elects to continuously monitor parameters or emissions, or to periodically determine the fuel sulfur content or fuel nitrogen content under this subpart, the owner or operator shall submit reports of excess emissions and monitor downtime, in accordance with § 60.7(c). Excess emissions shall be reported for all periods of unit operation, including startup, shutdown and malfunction. For the purpose of reports required under § 60.7(c), periods of excess emissions and monitor downtime that shall be reported are defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Nitrogen oxides.</P>
              <P>(i) For turbines using water or steam to fuel ratio monitoring:</P>
              <P>(A) An excess emission shall be any unit operating hour for which the average steam or water to fuel ratio, as measured by the continuous monitoring system, falls below the acceptable steam or water to fuel ratio needed to demonstrate compliance with § 60.332, as established during the performance test required in § 60.8. Any unit operating hour in which no water or steam is injected into the turbine shall also be considered an excess emission.</P>
              <P>(B) A period of monitor downtime shall be any unit operating hour in which water or steam is injected into the turbine, but the essential parametric data needed to determine the steam or water to fuel ratio are unavailable or invalid.</P>
              <P>(C) Each report shall include the average steam or water to fuel ratio, average fuel consumption, ambient conditions (temperature, pressure, and humidity), gas turbine load, and (if applicable) the nitrogen content of the fuel during each excess emission. You do not have to report ambient conditions if you opt to use the worst case ISO correction factor as specified in § 60.334(b)(3)(ii), or if you are not using the ISO correction equation under the provisions of § 60.335(b)(1).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the owner or operator elects to take an emission allowance for fuel bound nitrogen, then excess emissions and periods of monitor downtime are as described in paragraphs (j)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) An excess emission shall be the period of time during which the fuel-bound nitrogen (N) is greater than the value measured during the performance test required in § 60.8 and used to determine the allowance. The excess emission begins on the date and hour of the sample which shows that N is greater than the performance test value, and ends with the date and hour of a subsequent sample which shows a fuel nitrogen content less than or equal to the performance test value.</P>

              <P>(B) A period of monitor downtime begins when a required sample is not taken by its due date. A period of monitor downtime also begins on the date and hour that a required sample is <PRTPAGE P="528"/>taken, if invalid results are obtained. The period of monitor downtime ends on the date and hour of the next valid sample.</P>
              <P>(iii) For turbines using NO<E T="52">X</E> and diluent CEMS:</P>

              <P>(A) An hour of excess emissions shall be any unit operating hour in which the 4-hour rolling average NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration exceeds the applicable emission limit in § 60.332(a)(1) or (2). For the purposes of this subpart, a “4-hour rolling average NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration” is the arithmetic average of the average NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration measured by the CEMS for a given hour (corrected to 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E> and, if required under § 60.335(b)(1), to ISO standard conditions) and the three unit operating hour average NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations immediately preceding that unit operating hour.</P>

              <P>(B) A period of monitor downtime shall be any unit operating hour in which sufficient data are not obtained to validate the hour, for either NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration or diluent (or both).</P>
              <P>(C) Each report shall include the ambient conditions (temperature, pressure, and humidity) at the time of the excess emission period and (if the owner or operator has claimed an emission allowance for fuel bound nitrogen) the nitrogen content of the fuel during the period of excess emissions. You do not have to report ambient conditions if you opt to use the worst case ISO correction factor as specified in § 60.334(b)(3)(ii), or if you are not using the ISO correction equation under the provisions of § 60.335(b)(1).</P>

              <P>(iv) For owners or operators that elect, under paragraph (f) of this section, to monitor combustion parameters or parameters that document proper operation of the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls:</P>
              <P>(A) An excess emission shall be a 4-hour rolling unit operating hour average in which any monitored parameter does not achieve the target value or is outside the acceptable range defined in the parameter monitoring plan for the unit.</P>
              <P>(B) A period of monitor downtime shall be a unit operating hour in which any of the required parametric data are either not recorded or are invalid.</P>
              <P>(2) Sulfur dioxide. If the owner or operator is required to monitor the sulfur content of the fuel under paragraph (h) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) For samples of gaseous fuel and for oil samples obtained using daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling from the unit's storage tank, an excess emission occurs each unit operating hour included in the period beginning on the date and hour of any sample for which the sulfur content of the fuel being fired in the gas turbine exceeds 0.8 weight percent and ending on the date and hour that a subsequent sample is taken that demonstrates compliance with the sulfur limit.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the option to sample each delivery of fuel oil has been selected, the owner or operator shall immediately switch to one of the other oil sampling options (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling from the unit's storage tank) if the sulfur content of a delivery exceeds 0.8 weight percent. The owner or operator shall continue to use one of the other sampling options until all of the oil from the delivery has been combusted, and shall evaluate excess emissions according to paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section. When all of the fuel from the delivery has been burned, the owner or operator may resume using the as-delivered sampling option.</P>
              <P>(iii) A period of monitor downtime begins when a required sample is not taken by its due date. A period of monitor downtime also begins on the date and hour of a required sample, if invalid results are obtained. The period of monitor downtime shall include only unit operating hours, and ends on the date and hour of the next valid sample.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Ice fog.</E> Each period during which an exemption provided in § 60.332(f) is in effect shall be reported in writing to the Administrator quarterly. For each period the ambient conditions existing during the period, the date and time the air pollution control system was deactivated, and the date and time the air pollution control system was reactivated shall be reported. All quarterly reports shall be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter.<PRTPAGE P="529"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Emergency fuel.</E> Each period during which an exemption provided in § 60.332(k) is in effect shall be included in the report required in § 60.7(c). For each period, the type, reasons, and duration of the firing of the emergency fuel shall be reported.</P>
              <P>(5) All reports required under § 60.7(c) shall be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each 6-month period.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test methods and procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance tests required in § 60.8, using either</P>
              <P>(1) EPA Method 20,</P>
              <P>(2) ASTM D6522-00 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or</P>

              <P>(3) EPA Method 7E and either EPA Method 3 or 3A in appendix A to this part, to determine NO<E T="52">X</E> and diluent concentration.</P>
              <P>(4) Sampling traverse points are to be selected following Method 20 or Method 1, (non-particulate procedures) and sampled for equal time intervals. The sampling shall be performed with a traversing single-hole probe or, if feasible, with a stationary multi-hole probe that samples each of the points sequentially. Alternatively, a multi-hole probe designed and documented to sample equal volumes from each hole may be used to sample simultaneously at the required points.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the owner or operator may test at few points than are specified in Method 1 or Method 20 if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) You may perform a stratification test for NO<E T="52">X</E> and diluent pursuant to</P>
              <P>(A) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(B) The procedures specified in section 6.5.6.1(a) through (e) appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) Once the stratification sampling is completed, the owner or operator may use the following alternative sample point selection criteria for the performance test:</P>
              <P>(A) If each of the individual traverse point NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations, normalized to 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E>, is within 10 percent of the mean normalized concentration for all traverse points, then you may use 3 points (located either 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the way across the stack or duct, or, for circular stacks or ducts greater than 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the wall). The 3 points shall be located along the measurement line that exhibited the highest average normalized NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration during the stratification test; or</P>
              <P>(B) If each of the individual traverse point NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations, normalized to 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E>, is within 5 percent of the mean normalized concentration for all traverse points, then you may sample at a single point, located at least 1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid.</P>
              <P>(6) Other acceptable alternative reference methods and procedures are given in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the applicable nitrogen oxides emission limitation in § 60.332 and shall meet the performance test requirements of § 60.8 as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) For each run of the performance test, the mean nitrogen oxides emission concentration (NO<E T="52">Xo</E>) corrected to 15 percent O<E T="52">2</E> shall be corrected to ISO standard conditions using the following equation. Notwithstanding this requirement, use of the ISO correction equation is optional for: Lean premix stationary combustion turbines; units used in association with heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) equipped with duct burners; and units equipped with add-on emission control devices:

              <P>(2) The 3-run performance test required by § 60.8 must be performed within 5 percent at 30, 50, 75, and 90-to-100 percent of peak load or at four evenly-spaced load points in the normal operating range of the gas turbine, including the minimum point in the operating range and 90-to-100 percent of peak load, or at the highest achievable load point if 90-to-100 percent of peak load cannot be physically achieved in practice. If the turbine combusts both oil and gas as primary or backup fuels, separate performance testing is required for each fuel. Notwithstanding these requirements, performance testing is not required for any emergency fuel (as defined in § 60.331).</P>

              <P>(3) For a combined cycle turbine system with supplemental heat (duct burner), the owner or operator may elect to measure the turbine NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions after the duct burner rather than directly after the turbine. If the owner or operator elects to use this alternative sampling location, the applicable NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit in § 60.332 for the combustion turbine must still be met.</P>
              <P>(4) If water or steam injection is used to control NO<E T="52">X</E> with no additional post-combustion NO<E T="52">X</E> control and the owner or operator chooses to monitor the steam or water to fuel ratio in accordance with § 60.334(a), then that monitoring system must be operated concurrently with each EPA Method 20, ASTM D6522-00 (incorporated by reference, see § 60.17), or EPA Method 7E run and shall be used to determine the fuel consumption and the steam or water to fuel ratio necessary to comply with the applicable § 60.332 NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit.</P>
              <P>(5) If the owner operator elects to claim an emission allowance for fuel bound nitrogen as described in § 60.332, then concurrently with each reference method run, a representative sample of the fuel used shall be collected and analyzed, following the applicable procedures described in § 60.335(b)(9). These data shall be used to determine the maximum fuel nitrogen content for which the established water (or steam) to fuel ratio will be valid.</P>
              <P>(6) If the owner or operator elects to install a CEMS, the performance evaluation of the CEMS may either be conducted separately (as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) or as part of the initial performance test of the affected unit.</P>

              <P>(7) If the owner or operator elects to install and certify a NO<E T="52">X</E> CEMS under § 60.334(e), then the initial performance test required under § 60.8 may be done in the following alternative manner:</P>
              <P>(i) Perform a minimum of 9 reference method runs, with a minimum time per run of 21 minutes, at a single load level, between 90 and 100 percent of peak (or the highest physically achievable) load.</P>

              <P>(ii) Use the test data both to demonstrate compliance with the applicable NO<E T="52">X</E> emission limit under § 60.332 and to provide the required reference method data for the RATA of the CEMS described under § 60.334(b).</P>
              <P>(iii) The requirement to test at three additional load levels is waived.</P>

              <P>(8) If the owner or operator elects under § 60.334(f) to monitor combustion parameters or parameters indicative of proper operation of NO<E T="52">X</E> emission controls, the appropriate parameters shall be continuously monitored and recorded during each run of the initial performance test, to establish acceptable operating ranges, for purposes of the parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit, as specified in § 60.334(g).</P>
              <P>(9) To determine the fuel bound nitrogen content of fuel being fired (if an emission allowance is claimed for fuel bound nitrogen), the owner or operator may use equipment and procedures meeting the requirements of:</P>

              <P>(i) For liquid fuels, ASTM D2597-94 (Reapproved 1999), D6366-99, D4629-02, D5762-02 (all of which are incorporated by reference, <E T="03">see</E> § 60.17); or</P>
              <P>(ii) For gaseous fuels, shall use analytical methods and procedures that are accurate to within 5 percent of the instrument range and are approved by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(10) If the owner or operator is required under § 60.334(i)(1) or (3) to periodically determine the sulfur content of the fuel combusted in the turbine, a minimum of three fuel samples shall be collected during the performance test. <PRTPAGE P="531"/>Analyze the samples for the total sulfur content of the fuel using:</P>

              <P>(i) For liquid fuels, ASTM D129-00, D2622-98, D4294-02, D1266-98, D5453-00 or D1552-01 (all of which are incorporated by reference, <E T="03">see</E> § 60.17); or</P>
              <P>(ii) For gaseous fuels, ASTM D1072-80, 90 (Reapproved 1994); D3246-81, 92, 96; D4468-85 (Reapproved 2000); or D6667-01 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see § 60.17). The applicable ranges of some ASTM methods mentioned above are not adequate to measure the levels of sulfur in some fuel gases. Dilution of samples before analysis (with verification of the dilution ratio) may be used, subject to the prior approval of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(11) The fuel analyses required under paragraphs (b)(9) and (b)(10) of this section may be performed by the owner or operator, a service contractor retained by the owner or operator, the fuel vendor, or any other qualified agency.</P>
              <P>(c) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Instead of using the equation in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, manufacturers may develop ambient condition correction factors to adjust the nitrogen oxides emission level measured by the performance test as provided in § 60.8 to ISO standard day conditions.</P>

              <P>(2) Except as provided under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, if affected facilities routinely share the same raw ink storage/handling system with existing facilities, then temporary measurement procedures for segregating the raw inks, related coatings, VOC solvent, and water used at the affected facilities must be employed during the test. For this case, an overall emission percentage for the combined facilities as well as for only the affected facilities must be calculated during the test.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purpose of measuring bulk storage tank quantities of each color of raw ink and each related coating used, the owner or operator of any affected facility shall install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate during the test one or more:</P>

              <P>(a) To determine compliance with § 60.442 the owner or operator of the affected facility shall calculate a weighted average of the mass of solvent used per mass of coating solids applied for a one calendar month period according to the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine the weight fraction of organics and the weight fraction of solids of each coating applied by using Reference Method 24 or by the coating manufacturer's formulation data.</P>
              <P>(2) Compute the weighted average by the following equation:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="59" SPAN="1">

              <P>(3) For each affected facility where the value of G is less than or equal to 0.20 kg VOC per kg of coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance with § 60.442(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(b) To determine compliance with § 60.442(a)(2), the owner or operator shall calculate the required overall VOC emission reduction according to the following equation:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="26" SPAN="1">
                <GID>EC16NO91.033</GID>
              </GPH>
              <FP>If R<E T="52">q</E> is less than or equal to 90 percent, then the required overall VOC emission reduction is R<E T="52">q</E>. If R<E T="52">q</E> is greater than 90 percent, then the required overall VOC emission reduction is 90 percent.</FP>
              <P>(c) Where compliance with the emission limits specified in § 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent recovery system, the owner or operator shall determine the overall VOC emission reduction for a one calendar month period by the following equation:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="31" SPAN="1">
                <GID>EC16NO91.034</GID>

              <FP>If the R value is equal to or greater than the R<E T="52">q</E> value specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then compliance with § 60.442(a)(2) is demonstrated.</FP>
              <P>(d) Where compliance with the emission limit specified in § 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent destruction device, the owner or operator shall determine calendar monthly compliance by comparing the monthly required overall VOC emission reduction specified in paragraph (b) of this section to the overall VOC emission reduction demonstrated in the most recent performance test which complied with § 60.442(a)(2). If the monthly required overall VOC emission reduction is less than or equal to the overall VOC reduction of the most recent performance test, the affected facility is in compliance with § 60.442(a)(2).</P>

              <P>(e) Where compliance with § 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent destruction device, the owner or operator shall continuously record the destruction device combustion temperature during coating operations for thermal incineration destruction devices or the gas temperature upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed during coating operations for catalytic incineration destruction devices. For thermal incineration destruction devices the owner or operator shall record all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average temperature of the device is more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average temperature of the device during the most recent performance test complying with § 60.442(a)(2). For catalytic incineration destruction devices, the owner or operator shall record all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average temperature of the device immediately before the catalyst bed is <PRTPAGE P="566"/>more than 28 °C (50 °F) below the average temperature of the device during the most recent performance test complying with § 60.442(a)(2), and all 3-hour periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the device during the most recent performance test complying with § 60.442(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(f) After the initial performance test required for all affected facilities under § 60.8, compliance with the VOC emission limitation and percentage reduction requirements under § 60.442 is based on the average emission reduction for one calendar month. A separate compliance test is completed at the end of each calendar month after the initial performance test, and a new calendar month's average VOC emission reduction is calculated to show compliance with the standard.</P>
              <P>(g) If a common emission control device is used to recover or destroy solvent from more than one affected facility, the performance of that control device is assumed to be equal for each of the affected facilities. Compliance with § 60.442(a)(2) is determined by the methods specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and is performed simultaneously on all affected facilities.</P>
              <P>(h) If a common emission control device is used to recover solvent from an existing facility (or facilities) as well as from an affected facility (or facilities), the overall VOC emission reduction for the affected facility (or facilities), for the purpose of compliance, shall be determined by the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) shall determine the mass of solvent recovered for a calendar month period from the existing facility (or facilities) prior to the connection of the affected facility (or facilities) to the emission control device.</P>
              <P>(2) The affected facility (or facilities) shall then be connected to the emission control device.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator shall determine the total mass of solvent recovered from both the existing and affected facilities over a calendar month period. The mass of solvent determined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section from the existing facility shall be subtracted from the total mass of recovered solvent to obtain the mass of solvent recovered from the affected facility (or facilities). The overall VOC emission reduction of the affected facility (or facilities) can then be determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If a common emission control device(s) is used to destruct solvent from an existing facility (or facilities) as well as from an affected facility (or facilities), the overall VOC emission reduction for the affected facility (or facilities), for the purpose of compliance, shall be determined by the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall operate the emission control device with both the existing and affected facilities connected.</P>
              <P>(2) The concentration of VOC (in parts per million by volume) after the common emission control device shall be determined as specified in § 60.444(c). This concentration is used in the calculation of compliance for both the existing and affected facilities.</P>
              <P>(3) The volumetric flow out of the common control device attributable to the affected facility (or facilities) shall be calculated by first determining the ratio of the volumetric flow entering the common control device attributable to the affected facility (facilities) to the total volumetric flow entering the common control device from both existing and affected facilities. The multiplication of this ratio by the total volumetric flow out of the common control device yields the flow attributable to the affected facility (facilities). Compliance is determined by the use of the equation specified in § 60.444(c).</P>
              <P>(j) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source category. Emissions from these operations are to be included when determining if the standard specified at § 60.442(a)(2) is being attained.</P>

              <P>(g) If fuel oil is to be used to fire an afterburner used to control emissions from a blowing still, the owner or operator may petition the Administrator in accordance with § 60.11(e) of the General Provisions to establish an opacity standard for the blowing still that will be the opacity standard when fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. To obtain this opacity standard, the owner or operator must request the Administrator to determine opacity during an initial, or subsequent, performance test when fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. Upon receipt of the results of the performance test, the Administrator will make a finding concerning compliance <PRTPAGE P="586"/>with the mass standard for the blowing still. If the Administrator finds that the facility was in compliance with the mass standard during the performance test but failed to meet the zero opacity standard, the Administrator will establish and promulgate in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> an opacity standard for the blowing still that will be the opacity standard when fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. When the afterburner is fired with natural gas, the zero percent opacity remains the applicable opacity standard.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test methods and procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standards in §§ 60.482-1a through 60.482-11a, 60.483a, and 60.484a as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Method 21 shall be used to determine the presence of leaking sources. The instrument shall be calibrated before use each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 of this part. The following calibration gases shall be used:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); and</P>

              <P>(ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration no <PRTPAGE P="624"/>more than 2,000 ppm greater than the leak definition concentration of the equipment monitored. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple calibration scales, then the lower scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is no higher than 2,000 ppm above the concentration specified as a leak, and the highest scale shall be calibrated with a calibration gas that is approximately equal to 10,000 ppm. If only one scale on an instrument will be used during monitoring, the owner or operator need not calibrate the scales that will not be used during that day's monitoring.</P>
              <P>(2) A calibration drift assessment shall be performed, at a minimum, at the end of each monitoring day. Check the instrument using the same calibration gas(es) that were used to calibrate the instrument before use. Follow the procedures specified in Method 21 of appendix A-7 of this part, Section 10.1, except do not adjust the meter readout to correspond to the calibration gas value. Record the instrument reading for each scale used as specified in § 60.486a(e)(7). Calculate the average algebraic difference between the three meter readings and the most recent calibration value. Divide this algebraic difference by the initial calibration value and multiply by 100 to express the calibration drift as a percentage. If any calibration drift assessment shows a negative drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then all equipment monitored since the last calibration with instrument readings below the appropriate leak definition and above the leak definition multiplied by (100 minus the percent of negative drift/divided by 100) must be re-monitored. If any calibration drift assessment shows a positive drift of more than 10 percent from the initial calibration value, then, at the owner/operator's discretion, all equipment since the last calibration with instrument readings above the appropriate leak definition and below the leak definition multiplied by (100 plus the percent of positive drift/divided by 100) may be re-monitored.</P>
              <P>(c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the no-detectable-emission standards in §§ 60.482-2a(e), 60.482-3a(i), 60.482-4a, 60.482-7a(f), and 60.482-10a(e) as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The requirements of paragraph (b) shall apply.</P>
              <P>(2) Method 21 of appendix A-7 of this part shall be used to determine the background level. All potential leak interfaces shall be traversed as close to the interface as possible. The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 500 ppm for determining compliance.</P>
              <P>(d) The owner or operator shall test each piece of equipment unless he demonstrates that a process unit is not in VOC service, i.e., that the VOC content would never be reasonably expected to exceed 10 percent by weight. For purposes of this demonstration, the following methods and procedures shall be used:</P>
              <P>(1) Procedures that conform to the general methods in ASTM E260-73, 91, or 96, E168-67, 77, or 92, E169-63, 77, or 93 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the percent VOC content in the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a piece of equipment.</P>
              <P>(2) Organic compounds that are considered by the Administrator to have negligible photochemical reactivity may be excluded from the total quantity of organic compounds in determining the VOC content of the process fluid.</P>
              <P>(3) Engineering judgment may be used to estimate the VOC content, if a piece of equipment had not been shown previously to be in service. If the Administrator disagrees with the judgment, paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that a piece of equipment is in light liquid service by showing that all the following conditions apply:</P>

              <P>(1) The vapor pressure of one or more of the organic components is greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 °C (1.2 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O at 68 °F). Standard reference texts or ASTM D2879-83, 96, or 97 (incorporated by reference—see § 60.17) shall be used to determine the vapor pressures.</P>

              <P>(2) The total concentration of the pure organic components having a <PRTPAGE P="625"/>vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kPa at 20 °C (1.2 in. H<E T="52">2</E>O at 68 °F) is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight.</P>
              <P>(3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(f) Samples used in conjunction with paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of this section shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment or the gas being combusted in the flare.</P>

The Administrator will approve the sampling of representative stacks on a case-by-case basis if the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the testing of representative stacks would yield results comparable to those that would be obtained by testing all stacks.</P>
